//! The PTY pump: bridges a [`PtyProcess`] and a [`RelayChannel`] both directions.
//!
//! * **Output** (tty → relay): a blocking task reads the PTY master and forwards
//!   chunks over a bounded channel to the relay-send loop, which ships each as a
//!   [`StreamFrame`](opengeni_agent_proto::v1::StreamFrame). The bounded channel is
//!   the backpressure point — a slow viewer cannot make the agent buffer
//!   unboundedly.
//! * **Input** (relay → tty): inbound [`StreamFrame`]s are raw keystrokes written
//!   to the PTY writer. A [`DesktopInput`] on a PTY channel is ignored (it belongs
//!   to a desktop channel).
//!
//! On a relay transport drop the pump's send loop returns; the owner re-registers
//! the channel (resume-from-seq) and resumes — the PTY process keeps running, so a
//! relay blip never kills the terminal (§10.6).
//!
//! portable-pty's master IO is blocking `std::io`, so the read/write touch the
//! blocking pool; the agent's async runtime is never stalled on tty IO.
