# SuperGrok/xAI connected subscriptions

This is the canonical contract for SuperGrok/xAI connected-subscription
authority, account management, allocation, leasing, and durable capacity
recovery. The xAI API-key provider remains a separate rail.

Canonical implementation sources:

- protocol/OAuth/transport: `packages/xai-subscription`;
- public management API: `apps/api/src/routes/supergrok.ts`;
- persistence and RLS: `packages/db/src/xai-subscription.ts` adapts the shared
  `packages/db/src/subscription-account-repository.ts` lifecycle and
  `packages/db/src/subscription-pool-schema.ts` table definitions;
  `packages/db/src/index.ts`, `packages/db/src/schema.ts`, and migration
  `0234_xai_subscription_authority.sql`;
- runtime: `apps/worker/src/activities/xai-auth.ts` and
  `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/xai-capacity.ts`;
- workflow capacity orchestration: `apps/worker/src/activities/codex-capacity.ts`
  and `apps/worker/src/workflows/session.ts`;
- clients: the SuperGrok methods/types in `@opengeni/sdk`,
  `useSuperGrokAccounts` in `@opengeni/react`, and the workspace and organization settings cards.

## Enablement and connection

`OPENGENI_SUPERGROK_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED=true` enables the rail. The config
library stays fail-closed (`false` when unset); `bun run dev` enables the rail
for local development when the variable is absent, matching Codex. Production
and Helm still require an explicit true. OAuth material
is authenticated-encrypted at rest, so a stable
`OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required before connection or runtime
materialization can succeed.

Connection uses xAI's OAuth device flow. The API returns a user code and
verification URI, polls the provider server-side, derives the selected
user/team/organization identity from the token claims returned directly by the
xAI HTTPS token endpoint, and upserts the encrypted credential by that provider
identity without a second user-info request. xAI validates the access token on
provider API use. The browser honors the provider interval and keeps polling
through retryable gateway or network failures with bounded backoff until the
device code's absolute expiry. List, status, SDK, React, and web surfaces are
metadata-only; access tokens, refresh tokens, cookies, encrypted blobs, and
provider response bodies never cross them.

Connection failures emit only fixed provider/phase/outcome fields and the
grammar-validated HTTP correlation id when structured logs are enabled. OAuth
material, workspace or subject identifiers, provider bodies, and raw exception
messages are never projected into public logs.

## Authority model

Every account has one immutable authority scope:

- **`organization`**: shared across the organization's shared and Personal
  workspaces. Connecting, renaming, selecting the default, changing rotation or
  eligibility, and disconnecting require an organization administrator browser
  session. Workspace users can use the pool but cannot administer it.

- **`workspace`** — the default and simplest path. The account is shared with
  members who can use that workspace's model rail. Connecting or mutating this
  scope requires workspace-admin authority.
- **`user`** — explicit private authority. Connect and mutation require the
  exact managed-browser human with `connections:write`; bearer authentication
  is rejected for this path. The row is bound to the generic
  organization-user resource authority and exact membership generation.

Connection attribution is audit metadata, not ownership authority. There is no
per-use consent flow, implicit personal-account selection, or fallback to the
session creator/current browser user/another member.

At each acceptance boundary Opengeni freezes an identifier-free
`XaiProviderAccountAuthoritySnapshotV1` on the logical turn or scheduled task.
Workspace scope records only `{version:1, scope:"workspace"}`; organization
scope records `{version:1, scope:"organization"}`. New acceptance prefers an
explicit active private pool, then connected workspace accounts, then the
organization pool. Adding a workspace account does not rewrite the scope of
already accepted work. User scope adds
the immutable authority generation, never a credential UUID, membership UUID,
provider subject, label, quota, plan, or token. Direct Send/Steer resolves the
authenticated subject's current active authority; edits copy the source turn;
children copy the exact spawning parent turn; goal continuations copy the latest
finished causal turn; scheduled occurrences copy the task snapshot; compaction,
child results, and coalesced internal updates preserve the same snapshot.
The pool belongs to the receiving session, not the sender: Agent Message and
Agent Steer keep the sender's causal human but take the receiver's execution
context turn, else its latest accepted turn, else its initial snapshot. A
user-scoped pool is kept only for its own human (a child's initial snapshot
belongs to its spawning turn's human); otherwise the receiver uses its
organization or workspace pool, and a model that only that personal pool
serves fails closed. Acceptance without an exact human (service and operator actors,
organization API keys, bridges, non-subject session creators, and internal
updates without causal authority) resolves the organization or workspace pool
and never a personal pool. Already accepted work keeps its frozen
snapshot. Private work additionally requires the exact initiating human.

Pool authority is additive to session access, never a replacement for it.
Shared (organization or workspace) pools are read and written under the
synthetic pool-worker database subject (`worker:xai-workspace`, or
`worker:claude-workspace` for the Claude pool that shares this code). Arming
and reconciling a shared pool's capacity wait run without a subject
(`withScopedCapacityWaiterRls`), like Codex waiters; a personal pool acts as
its initiating human. The waiter lookup, workflow peek, lease, pin and
last-account operations that run as the pool-worker subject without an ambient
actor re-establish the acting turn's frozen `initiating_human_subject_id`
(`withSubscriptionPoolSessionAccess` in
`packages/db/src/subscription-session-access.ts`). A `user_private` session
therefore arms, waits and resumes exactly like a shared one, while the pool
worker still sees no other member's private sessions. A caller with any
ambient session actor keeps it unchanged; the turn's human is never combined
with a different subject. Immediate wake-ups (reconnect, allocator, rotation or
pin changes) first check that the caller holds the shared pool: a subject with
live authority over the workspace, an active organization member for the
organization pool, or the provider's pool-worker subject. For such a caller,
the waiter scan, wake-revision bump and workflow wake then run in the trusted
service scope, which follows the Codex rule. That reaches every waiter of
exactly that pool scope in that workspace, including other members'
`user_private` waiters. Any other caller wakes under its own subject and
reaches no other member's private waiter. The wake returns nothing, so it
grants no read access to those sessions and reveals no count of them. A
personal pool's waiters all belong to its
owner and wake under the owner's subject. The periodic recheck, at most 60
seconds away, remains a backstop. If a wait still cannot be armed for a
non-database reason, the turn fails with the explicit, retryable
`<provider>_capacity_wait_unavailable` state instead of a generic activity
failure; operators see the underlying error class and SQLSTATE in the worker
log, never in the user-visible message.

## Allocation, pins, and leases

Disconnecting a workspace or personal credential clears its session pin and pin
source atomically before deletion. Pin versions advance to reject stale edits;
unrelated account pins remain unchanged.

One rotation row serializes each organization, workspace, or exact-user pool. Credentials have
separate health and allocator state: `status=active` is credential health, while
`allocator_enabled` controls only new selection. Reconnect and refresh restore
credential health but do not silently change allocator eligibility.

Selection is deterministic and transaction-scoped:

1. revalidate the accepted turn's authority snapshot under exact-subject FORCE
   RLS;
2. lock the pool rotation row, reap expired leases, and reuse an exact live
   same-turn lease when present;
3. filter to active, allocator-enabled, non-exhausted accounts; an expired
   access token remains eligible because the request transport can refresh it;
4. honor a session pin when present; otherwise balance concurrent live-turn
   leases, then use fair least-selected, least-recent ordering when rotation is
   enabled, or the explicit active credential when rotation is disabled;
5. write the unique `(workspace_id, turn_id)` lease, fairness metadata, and
   active cursor in one transaction.

The five-minute lease is renewed every minute and at runtime/model-usage
ownership checkpoints. A replacement holder advances generation. Leases fence
exact turn ownership; they do not serialize an account or limit its concurrent
sessions. Every release is idempotent.

## Provider requests and media

The worker decrypts only the exact selected credential after revalidating the
frozen authority. Requests use request-local async context; credentials never
enter session history, events, RunState, model-visible tool arguments, or the
sandbox environment. A 401 receives one OAuth refresh and one replay of the
same replayable JSON request. The Responses transport normalizes xAI's stream,
encrypted reasoning, and hosted web/X search. The model catalog is the static
OpenGeni-supported product set; the status route uses xAI's model endpoint only
to validate a credential. Portable compaction reuses the same provider context. Image generation uses the ordinary
durable generated-image operation/artifact boundary; xAI video helpers retain
their existing durable video boundary.

Each streaming response has one liveness rule: if no complete, valid SSE data
event arrives for `OPENGENI_SUPERGROK_RESPONSE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default
five minutes), the transport cancels that accepted stream and surfaces a typed
partial-response timeout without replay. Every valid event resets the timer;
there is no model-call or run-duration deadline. HTTP 200 SSE terminals
(`type: "error"`, `response.failed`, `response.error`, `response.incomplete`)
are intercepted before the OpenAI Agents SDK: the transport does not enqueue
them, throws a typed error whose message is the exact bounded provider
diagnostic, and the worker persists that text on `turn.failed` unless the
diagnostic is a rate-limit/capacity refusal. Those refusals are marked 429 and
enter the durable same-turn capacity waiter instead of failing the turn. Request
lifecycle audit records request identity, attempt, headers, first event, event
count/type, last-progress duration, and terminal outcome, but never request
bodies, credentials, output, or the provider error text. Worker stdout/OTEL
stay sanitized.

## Failure and durable capacity semantics

Only definitive account refusal may walk the pool:

- a typed permanent refresh failure or marked 401 sets the exact leased
  credential to `needs_relogin`;
- a marked 403 sets that credential to `error`;
- a marked HTTP 429, or an HTTP 200 SSE terminal whose bounded provider
  diagnostic is a rate-limit/capacity refusal (`rate_limit_exceeded`,
  `too_many_requests`, overload/capacity codes, or the observed Grok sentence
  "The model is currently at capacity due to high demand..."), installs an
  exact-account cooldown using `Retry-After`, falling back to one minute.
  Isolated "high demand" / "overloaded" / "rate limit" wording is not enough.
  That path arms the same durable `waiting_capacity` waiter; it must not
  settle `turn.failed` as a permanent non-retryable error.

The credential mutation, exact lease fence, exact attempt close, pending-tool
closure, audit events, turn/session `waiting_capacity` transition, lease
release, and waiter arm are one transaction. Conversation truth is checkpointed
first. The worker immediately performs one metadata-only re-evaluation: an
alternate account moves the same logical turn to `recovering`; otherwise the
provider-tagged waiter persists until a quota reset, account reconnect,
allocator/rotation/pin mutation, or bounded timer wakes it.

Cached quota exhaustion is rechecked against provider billing before allocation
and during capacity reconciliation (at most once per account per 30 seconds).
Waiters recheck within the normal bounded refresh interval even when the stored
reset is hours away, so an external usage reset can resume the same turn. A
successful refresh below 100% clears exhaustion; unavailable or unknown billing
preserves it. Updates compare the previously observed quota timestamp and
exhaustion deadline so a stale refresh cannot overwrite a newer refusal.

Ambiguous network failures, provider 5xx, malformed/partial streams, invalid
content, and unrelated 4xx errors do not quarantine or rotate credentials. They
remain on the existing same-provider recovery or terminal path because upstream
acceptance/effects may be ambiguous.

The waiter stores no credential material. It carries the blocked turn
generation, pool scope, optional active-goal id/version fence, reset/check time,
and revisioned wake state. PostgreSQL is authoritative; Temporal signals are
repairable hints, and `session_workflow_wake_outbox` repairs commit-to-signal
loss. Pause preserves the waiter. Steer, cancellation, goal change, authority
change, active-turn change, or another semantic fence supersedes it cleanly.
The protocol never creates a queue row, synthetic user message, model polling
turn, consent prompt, or ambient-user fallback.

## Public management surface

Organization management is available under
`/v1/organizations/:organizationId/supergrok`: device-flow `connect/start` and
`connect/poll`, `accounts`, `accounts/:accountId/activate`, `settings`,
`accounts/:accountId/allocator`, rename (`PATCH accounts/:accountId`), and
disconnect (`DELETE accounts/:accountId`). Device state binds the organization
and administrator identity. Organization accounts are encrypted once, with
workspace-owned leases and pins referring to the shared credential; disconnect
is refused while a live lease exists. Pool changes durably wake waiting organization turns across the same organization
without exposing their session content to the administrator.

The workspace-scoped REST surface supports device-flow start/poll, metadata
list/status, active-account selection, rotation enablement, allocator OCC,
rename, and disconnect. `@opengeni/sdk` exposes matching typed methods;
`@opengeni/react` exposes `useSuperGrokAccounts`; the Opengeni web workspace
settings page provides the complete account controls. Workspace is the default
scope in every client. Private scope must be selected explicitly and succeeds
only through the managed-browser human boundary above.


Organization SuperGrok activates at maintenance migration
`0423_organization_supergrok_subscriptions.sql`. Stop API, control worker, and
turn worker before applying it with every runtime database login listed in
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`. Start only the matching release;
older processes do not understand the new frozen organization scope.
