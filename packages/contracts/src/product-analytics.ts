 * - `api_key`: an API key or configured key, including the SDK and scripts.
 * - `embedded`: a host that embeds OpenGeni through signed delegation or an
 *   organization key acting for an external user.
 * - `scheduled`: a scheduled-task occurrence.
 * - `agent`: another agent (a child session, an agent message, or Agent Steer).
 * - `voice`: a realtime voice delegation or its end-of-call handoff.
 * - `site`: a published workspace Site.
 * - `automation`: an event-triggered automation run.
 * - `mcp`: an external MCP client connected through workspace MCP OAuth.
 * - `system`: OpenGeni's own maintenance work with no human entry.
 *
 * Turns that no new request entered (goal continuations, child results,
 * command results, wait timeouts, compaction) inherit the surface of the
 * session's latest started turn. Null means no surface was captured: rows
 * written before capture existed, or machine work in a session that has
 * never started a turn with one.
