# One Skill system

Design specification · updated September 9, 2026.

Design-review baseline: `origin/main` at `d33ce73b54fb4656213790dc4b035e9bcafc9a41`.
Implementation started from `cb97a3eb` on branch `feat/unified-skills`.
This is a proposed implementation design, not a claim that the system is built.
It replaces the previous draft and appended audit. Statements marked proposed
are recommendations, not additional user agreements.

## Summary

One Skill product for installed and authored Skills, including what the UI now
calls preference-registry Skills. Read without a sandbox. Edit small text files
directly; use a sandbox when execution or complex editing needs one. Keep saved
history and protect local customizations from upstream replacement.

Only `skill_read` is eager. Management tools are lazy and explained by a small
built-in Skill. Keep the agent interface simple; do not make agents manage
read-version pins or introduce remote preview as a prerequisite.

## 1. Agreed direction

- A Skill is a **folder containing `SKILL.md` and supporting files**, including
  nested paths. `SKILL.md` is the entry point, not the whole Skill.
- Unify portable Skills and preference-registry Skills. Two editing interfaces
  are fine; two independently writable versions of the same Skill are not.
- Instructions remain always-on rules; Memory holds facts and outcomes;
  Documents are evidence. Plugins compose/distribute capabilities,
  including Skills. None becomes another Skill store.
- Provide a first-class Skills destination under Capabilities. Agent Knowledge
  may show authored/managed Skills from that same system.
- Agents may search the public ecosystem, install, create, and edit Skills,
  including installed Skills. Workspace autonomy controls persistent changes;
  do not infer permission from an agent saying “the user asked.”
- Prioritize Autonomous behavior; a substantial review UI is secondary.
- Simple editing must not require a sandbox. Checkout is available when needed.
- Normal reading must not require starting or materializing into a sandbox.
- `skill_read` is eager: omitted paths read `SKILL.md`; explicit paths read
  exactly those files. Never implicitly add `SKILL.md` to explicit paths.
- All Skill management tools are lazy. A built-in management Skill explains
  discovery, creation, editing, and the system's behavior.
- Preserve versions so earlier content can be restored. Upstream updates must
  not silently overwrite workspace customizations.
- Do not require remote pre-install inspection or session-level read-version
  pinning for this work.

## 2. Proposed simple model

A Skill has a stable identity, metadata derived from `SKILL.md`, a current saved folder, and
saved history. Installed Skills also retain their source and upstream version.
The exact schema is still to be chosen; a Skill is not identified solely by its
frontmatter name, since different sources may use the same name.

Direct file saves and sandbox publishes create revisions of the **same** Skill.
Names remain convenient labels. The backend handles identity, atomic writes,
history, and protection against stale edits; these are not separate user flows.

Read the current saved version on each call. A single multi-file read should
return a coherent folder, but separate reads may observe subsequent saves.
There is no session-wide revision-pinning protocol in this design.

### Text files, not arbitrary binary assets

Proposed boundary: `SKILL.md` plus supporting UTF-8 text files, regardless of
extension. Code, shell scripts, JSON, YAML, configuration, reference text, and
text templates are included; extensionless files are allowed.

Do not add a programming-language extension whitelist or binary/blob support
for this iteration. Validate paths, encoding and size. Reject unsupported
files with clear paths rather than silently dropping them. UTF-8 validity is
not a safety assessment or proof that a file is useful guidance. Decide the
precise NUL/control-byte policy before shipping; encoding checks alone do not
perfectly classify text.

This deliberately limits what OpenGeni can import. It is not a claim that every
external Skill must be text-only. Keep the existing limits initially unless
compatibility testing gives a reason to change them.

### Local edits and upstream updates

Keep the upstream reference separate from the current workspace content.
Proposed behavior: an unmodified Skill can receive an authorized source update;
a customized Skill retains its content and reports that an update is available.
No automatic merge or new fork-management UI is required.

Plugin refreshes must obey the same protection. A Skill update must not
repoint unrelated Plugin facets or disrupt another owner's installation.

## 3. Agent tools

Names below are proposed API names. Only the reader's eager visibility and path
semantics are settled; final schemas should follow the shared tool conventions.

| Tool | Visibility | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skill_read` | Eager | Return requested text files without a sandbox |
| `skill_search` | Lazy | Discover installed and available Skills |
| `skill_install` | Lazy | Resolve and install a source into the workspace |
| `skill_save` | Lazy | Create a Skill or save specified text-file changes |
| `skill_checkout` | Lazy | Materialize a Skill when files on disk are needed |
| `skill_publish` | Lazy | Save an edited sandbox folder through the same write service |
| `skill_remove` | Lazy | Permanently delete the saved Skill and all registry revisions, subject to the same Learning and authority boundary |

Permanent removal is the explicit exception to restoration/history retention.
The implemented removal and exact deletion-review contract is documented in
[`../skills-lifecycle.md`](../skills-lifecycle.md); it does not erase conversations.

Management tools use the canonical tool gateway and normal authorization.
“Eager reader built into the worker” describes availability to the model, not
permission to build a separate worker-only backend. Checkout is the only
operation here that inherently needs a sandbox; publishing a sandbox folder
naturally depends on that folder being accessible.

### Read

```text
skill_read({ skill, paths?, listFiles? })
```

- Omit `paths`: return `SKILL.md`. A repeat while the same revision and text
  are still in the session's active model history returns a short
  `alreadyInContext` receipt instead (see [run lifecycle](../run-lifecycle.md)).
- Specify `paths`: return exactly those paths, including multiple paths. An
  explicit path always returns a fresh copy.
- Proposed: reject an empty array rather than ambiguously defaulting it.
- Proposed: return files with their paths; report missing paths explicitly.
  Never silently omit files or present truncation as complete content.
- Resolve ambiguous names explicitly rather than choosing a source silently.
- An identifier that resolves to no Skill returns an error listing the
  available Skills by id and name only, the descriptors the index and
  `skill_search` already show, so the caller can retry. Entries resembling the
  requested identifier come first; the list is bounded (25 entries, 4 KiB) and
  points to `skill_search` for the rest. `skill_checkout` resolves through the
  same reader and returns the same list.
- Set `listFiles: true` without `paths`: return only relative `paths` (at most
  1,024) and available revision identity, with no file bodies and no sandbox.
  Combining inventory with `paths` is rejected. Inventory is on demand, never
  part of the standing prompt; omitted/false `listFiles` preserves text reads.
- Telemetry: every read is counted in `opengeni_skill_reads_total`, and a model
  read's tool-output event carries a content-free `opengeni/skillUse` fact in
  MCP `_meta` (see [run lifecycle](../run-lifecycle.md)). Neither changes what
  the model receives.
- The default read also returns a bounded `scripts` index (path plus first
  usage line of each runnable file), so commands are visible without checkout.

### Checkout

```text
skill_checkout({ skill, directory, paths? })
```

- Writes every missing file in one filesystem batch, normally one sandbox
  command and one workspace mutation admission.
- Never overwrites: identical files are kept and reported `unchanged`; any
  different existing entry fails before anything is written, so repeating a
  checkout into the same directory is safe and fast.
- `paths` copies exactly those files, for example one script to run.
- Only a complete checkout that created its directory returns the
  `skill_publish` base (`revisionId`, `scopeVersion`); other results say
  `publishable: false`.

### Search and install

Start with search → install → read. Remote preview is not a requirement.
Support the curated library and public ecosystem discovery, not merely a URL
input mislabeled as search. Exact provider integration needs verification.

The backend resolves and pins imported bytes. Agents should not have to invent
a content hash that no prior tool returned. Either return an opaque resolved
source from search or resolve within install. Preserve the existing human
preview/install checks; do not weaken that API to simplify the agent interface.

Installing guidance does not grant tools, credentials, or additional access.
External Skill content cannot change platform permissions or Learning policy.

### Save and publish

Proposed: `skill_save` accepts specified text files and explicit deletions.
Omitted files remain unchanged. Creating a Skill requires `SKILL.md`; deleting
that required file without replacing it is invalid. Updating a small reference
file should be as easy as updating the main file.

Publish transfers an edited directory through a backend/sandbox file path, not
by making the model serialize an entire directory into a tool argument.
Save and publish share validation, authorization, history, and activation.
Both detect stale writes and make retries safe. Exact schemas remain open.

## 4. Learning and permissions: agreed simplification

Do not distinguish agent-initiated from allegedly user-requested tool writes.
Authenticated human editing has human authority; agent calls remain agent calls.
All agents in a workspace can discover and read shared workspace Skills and
use management tools. No per-agent or per-Skill permission configuration is
introduced for ordinary shared workspace Skills. Workspace boundaries and
platform-owned built-in protection remain enforced by the backend.

Agreed target behavior:

| Learning mode | Persistent agent change |
| --- | --- |
| Off | Refused; no durable Skill change |
| Require approval | One exact-content chat decision, then immediate activation; inactive only until that decision |
| Autonomous | Valid, authorized change becomes current without approval |

Human saves bypass the agent Learning decision, not access checks or validation.
Prior versions remain available for restoration; restoration is a new recorded
change, not deletion of history. It must not silently erase a later edit.

Reuse the existing mode setting and useful approval/history mechanisms. Do not
assume that every file edit should traverse Knowledge claims, evidence reviews,
confidence scoring, and the entire existing derived-learning evaluator.

Ordinary Skill edits do not require Knowledge claims, evidence reviews or
confidence evaluation. Implement the mode decision directly in the shared Skill
write lifecycle, retaining tenancy, live-attempt checks, history and safe writes.
Existing source-policy compatibility must be accounted for during migration,
not silently discarded. Require approval must expose the complete immutable
folder in the chat decision. Successful confirmation activates once; no later
review inbox is required. Autonomous activates without that decision; Off remains
refusal. Pending proposals are retained evidence until decided, never a second
approval after a successful chat save.

## 5. Prompt and built-in management Skill

Keep a short catalog of available Skill names/identities and descriptions.
Do not make all file paths standing prompt content or inherit an old descriptor
budget without checking the combined catalog. Search handles overflow.

Minimal core instruction, proposed:

> Read relevant Skills with `skill_read`. Omit paths to read `SKILL.md`, or pass
> paths to read exactly those files. Reading does not require a sandbox. To find,
> install, create, or edit Skills, read the built-in `opengeni-skills` Skill.

The built-in Skill explains the lazy management tools, text-only file rules,
Learning behavior, direct edits versus checkout, history, and source updates.
It must itself be readable without a sandbox or management-tool discovery.
Keep this explanation in one place rather than repeating full workflows across
core instructions, preference guidance, and filesystem loader instructions.

Native tool-bound, repository, and session-selected Skills already exist. Their
readability does not imply editability. Preserve these sources during rollout;
prefer one reader where bytes are available without a sandbox, but do not promise
remote reads of repository files that only exist on a machine. Repository
discovery indexes those existing files without copying them.

### Frontmatter is the metadata authority

User clarification, September 8: a usable Skill must have valid `SKILL.md`
frontmatter. Its `name` and `description` are the only authored index metadata.
Database title/description columns are parsed projections of that exact immutable
revision, not another place to edit or shorten the description. There is no
independent "short description". Storage identity (UUID/source binding) is
separate from the authored name; renaming does not create another Skill.

All save, publish, import, and activation paths must use the same parser and
validation. The API and agent save requests accept files, not a competing
title/description pair. The simple editor edits frontmatter in the file. A future
form may edit that same frontmatter, never a separate field. Use a real YAML
parser so quoted, escaped, and block values have one interpretation. Validate
the Agent Skills name and description constraints; do not silently truncate a
valid description to fit a smaller database column.

The initial context index uses the parsed name/description from the active
revision, without transferring the whole folder or starting a sandbox.
Pending edits cannot change that active index. Reading explicit paths still
returns only those paths; metadata storage does not add SKILL.md implicitly.

Legacy conversion is required rollout work, not a permanent frontmatter-free
exception. Keep historical rows and hashes immutable. Convert legacy active
content through new valid revisions, preserving the body and using existing
metadata where frontmatter is absent; existing valid frontmatter wins over
conflicting database labels. Invalid or ambiguous inputs need explicit repair,
not silent omission. Conversion, restore, inline configuration, and
database projection consistency must be verified before this cutover ships.

Stored inline/session and automation read projections discard historical
name/description caches and derive them through the same strict file contract.
This does not rewrite stored manifest bytes or digests, nor synthesize missing
headers at runtime. New caller-supplied metadata must still match frontmatter.
Plain legacy inline content still needs explicit maintenance conversion;
the projection is not evidence that that rollout work is complete.

### Bundled guidance: one selector, individual inclusion rules

The September 8 implementation review identified inconsistent bundled selection:
artifact guidance follows the tool catalog, Sites is selected by compute backend,
and Connected Machines omit video guidance because the old loader cannot deliver
the files. These are existing delivery constraints, not a product rule that
Connected Machines should receive different instructions.

The server-readable native artifact loader has no compute-backend input and
does not stage files. The worker now selects it through `skill-selection.ts`.
Preserve generated Sites package-version metadata when reading or checking out
its folder. This branch has not completed API/UI cutover or been deployed.

User clarification, September 8: use one mechanism for bundled selection, but
choose the inclusion rule separately for each Skill. Do not impose a universal
"all related tools must exist" rule. An artifact Skill can be included whenever
its chosen condition holds; Sites, video and management can have different
conditions. The exact per-Skill conditions are product choices, not new storage
types, permission systems, or sandbox-provider branches.

**Startup invariant:** evaluate these conditions from already-resolved local
configuration and packaged metadata. Never await MCP discovery, lazy tool
schemas, credential materialization, a provider health probe, sandbox startup,
or filesystem staging to build the initial bundled index. Configured/enabled
does not mean loaded/healthy. Tool execution still uses its normal live checks.

Proposed implementation: a small typed built-in definition list containing
stable id, packaged content source, descriptor, and a synchronous inclusion
predicate over the resolved session configuration. Use ordinary code, not a
user-authored condition language or generic dependency engine. Keep the rules
together and test each independently. A rule may consult configured tool names
and permission selections when useful, but never the prepared tool catalog.
Do not require unrelated optional helpers (such as export) to include guidance
for a supported core workflow. Instructions must describe optional operations
honestly rather than promising that every referenced tool is enabled.

Resolve the effective set once for the accepted attempt and use it for the
prompt index, built-in search, reader, and checkout. Stable built-in ids must
not collide with installed or inline Skills of the same name; ambiguous names
require an id. An excluded built-in must not remain reachable via its short
name or a legacy loader. Existing history may still contain prior instructions;
selection is not retroactive erasure or a security boundary for public text.
No selected Skill grants tool authority.

Implementation choice: optional `bundledSkillIds` on session creation and
scheduled/automation session configuration narrows the per-Skill defaults
(omitted = defaults or parent inheritance; empty = no bundled guidance).
Allowlisting must not force a Skill whose inclusion condition is false. Keep
host restrictions separate from model-chosen settings; children must not widen
the host's ceiling. Reuse the existing session configuration/inheritance path,
including scheduled sessions, rather than introducing worker-only overrides.
Persist the distinction between omitted and empty. Unknown explicit ids fail
validation. Store the resolved choice in sanitized immutable session metadata,
following the existing create-identity convention; expose it as a typed session
field. Reading that stored choice drops ids the running build does not know
(for example, a row written by a newer release), so the read narrows the
selection instead of failing; it never reverts to defaults. Raw caller
metadata cannot override it. Keyed create retries must retain the same
effective selection, and compare against the exact stored value rather than
that narrowed read. Agent-created schedules inherit or narrow their
creator's choice; an existing-session schedule cannot override its target.
Adding a new bundled Skill must not expand an explicit host selection.

This covers `opengeni-skills` as well: do not unconditionally inject management
guidance outside the selector. Eager `skill_read` remains available even if no
bundled Skills are selected; an empty index must not advertise a hidden
management Skill. Learning Off does not itself disable Skill reading or imply
that management guidance should disappear. Installed workspace Skills remain
shared as agreed; restricting platform bundles is not a new per-agent ACL for
authored, installed, repository or inline session content.

Compute backend does not determine whether packaged bytes can be read. Actual
workflow requirements may still matter to a specific inclusion rule, but do not
equate Connected Machine with unsupported execution. Read packaged references
server-side; checkout only when scripts/templates must exist on disk. Update
bundled instructions that assume their supporting files already have sandbox
paths. Preserve generated Sites package-version metadata through both paths.

For new attempts, recompute selection from the normal resolved configuration.
Do not mutate an in-flight prompt index when lazy discovery completes. Continue
to apply live authorization at execution. Newly installed workspace Skills can
be found/read through the shared service without rebuilding the standing index.
Remote MCP Skill discovery is a later adapter, not a prerequisite for this
bundled path; an unknown remote index must not delay the first model request.

Implementation checks required before rollout:

- A deferred tool-preparation promise that never resolves does not prevent the
  first model request from containing the expected bundled descriptors or
  prevent a selected built-in `skill_read` from executing.
- Managed, Connected Machine, and sandbox-free configurations yield identical
  bundled content when the per-Skill conditions are otherwise identical; no
  create/start/stage operation occurs during selection or reading.
- Each inclusion predicate has positive/negative tests, including partial tool
  selections, disabled optional helpers, and configured-but-unavailable tools.
- Explicit host exclusions, empty selection, child inheritance and scheduled
  sessions agree across index/search/read/checkout/legacy paths. Read-only and
  Learning Off configurations remain able to read permitted guidance.
- Duplicate names resolve by stable id; excluded built-ins cannot be reached
  by alias. Selected generated/supporting files preserve exact bytes.
- Product integration docs, SDK contracts, examples, and customer coding-agent
  Skills explain the actual public control. No new control is documented as
  shipped from a runtime helper alone.

The exact predicates remain ordinary product defaults. The shared mechanism
supports changing each independently without
requiring all bundled Skills to use the same policy.

Initial implementation defaults, subject to product refinement: artifact
guidance requires configured `editable_artifact_list` and `editable_artifact_get`
(not the entire family or optional exports); Sites requires configured
`artifacts_create` and `artifacts_publish`; video follows enabled workspace video
policy without resolving credentials; management is included by default.
`bundledSkillIds` can narrow all of these, including management. A
stalled-discovery regression test exercises first-request
index visibility and eager reads on all three lazy-tool transports.

Management guidance now enters through that same selector: the formatter and
reader do not inject it independently. The selected management folder is also
available to search and checkout. This removes the hidden read/index exception;
the typed host selection uses that same effective set.

Implementation verification in progress (September 8): the shared web editor
and SDK/API folder routes are wired. Component tests cover metadata-first reads,
supporting-file retention, read-only controls, and stale workspace responses.
The desktop browser fixture has passed edit, cancelled discard, save, supporting
file readback, and overflow/error checks. HTTP lifecycle and service-install
Learning-mode tests have passed on PostgreSQL on intermediate branch heads;
the integrated final head still requires re-verification. The typed public
bundled selection and composite per-Skill outcome notices are implemented.
Composite publication now waits for enclosing Plugin ownership finalization;
the latest integrated PostgreSQL run remains a release gate.

Current main has been merged and the unpublished Skill migration renumbered to
0433 without repinning published migration hashes. The browser tree-shaking fix
is integrated and the post-merge production build passes unchanged budgets.
Projects guidance now uses the same host-controlled bundle selection and eager
reader, with no unconditional second index or reader tool.
Legacy lowercased source IDs are retained for compatibility. Imports reject a
different case-sensitive folder that would collide with an existing ID; installing
both case variants is unsupported until a dedicated identity migration exists.

Sandbox-free supporting-path inventory is implemented on `skill_read` via
`listFiles: true`. Public skills.sh imports require a matching current
frontmatter name (case-insensitive), never a mismatching folder-name fallback.
Stale slugs report an exact GitHub folder URL alternative; direct folder imports
remain exact, and duplicate frontmatter names still require that override.

Frontmatter migration uses the shared YAML parser, preserves valid YAML bytes,
and derives database descriptor columns from those files. Current legacy
configuration is archived before conversion; archives are runtime-inaccessible
and follow workspace deletion. Expired legacy
Skills must remain absent from the active index after migration. Real-PostgreSQL
tests cover these migration boundaries; the latest assertions remain a rollout
gate until executed on the integrated head. See `docs/skills-lifecycle.md`.

The catalog now has cursor-based metadata pagination end to end. Source-removal
receipts are surfaced by Skill and Plugin API responses and UI messages;
customized guidance remaining active is distinguished from deactivation.
Worker install retries consult their original-request receipt before remote
source resolution. Startup contribution accounting now uses the actual bounded
index text rather than loading every installed Skill folder.

Composite installs stage revisions without making them active. Finalization
publishes eligible guidance atomically with effective ownership, rechecking
Learning, authority, concurrency, expiry, and customization. Manual approval
cannot bypass unfinished ownership. Historical snapshots are never filtered
against mutable current owner state. Composite responses retain separate original
write and final publication receipts; the UI uses the final receipt when present.
Re-run admission/publication, recovery, and customization tests on the final
integrated PostgreSQL head before rollout.

## 6. Current implementation: verified baseline

Paths below refer to the main commit recorded at the top, not necessarily this
document branch's checkout. These are source findings, not production tests.

| Area | Current behavior / code |
| --- | --- |
| Portable storage | `packages/db/src/schema.ts`: `capability_skill_facets` and `capability_skill_files`; relative paths and text in Postgres |
| Installation | `packages/db/src/index.ts`: `installPortableSkill`; immutable plugin versions, installations and ownership |
| Import | `packages/core/src/domain/skill-imports.ts`: `resolveSkillImport` resolves supplied URLs; this is not ecosystem search |
| File limits | `packages/contracts/src/skill-files.ts`: 1,024 files, 2 MiB per file, 8 MiB total; imports strictly decode UTF-8 |
| Human install | `apps/api/src/routes/skills.ts`: existing preview/install boundary |
| Runtime | `packages/runtime/src/runtime-skills.ts`, `index.ts`: composed Skill sources and SDK lazy loading, not proof of eager sandbox copying |
| Tool delivery | `packages/tool-gateway`, `packages/runtime/src/lazy-tool-transport.ts`: shared gateway and eager/lazy model surfaces |
| Preference Skills | `docs/preference-registry.md`, `packages/runtime/src/workspace-governance.ts`: descriptors and exact registry retrieval handles, separate lifecycle |
| Learning | `docs/workspace-learning-policy.md`: no-active-policy default is now `suggest` / Require approval; activated policies and accepted snapshots remain authoritative |
| Existing review UI | `apps/web/src/routes/preference-registry-admin.tsx`: pending Skills under “Finish saving”; not a complete multi-file review interface |

Current instruction locations to reconcile:

- `packages/runtime/src/operational-instructions.ts`: `# Using skills`.
- `packages/runtime/src/workspace-governance.ts`: registry handle retrieval and
  `remember lane=preference` routing.
- `packages/runtime/src/workspace-skills.ts`: repository discovery/instructions.
- `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` and SDK lazy loader: filesystem loading.

The tool gateway introduced around PR #2166 is now present in main. This work
should use it, not add a competing execution path. Skills-over-MCP remains a
possible later source/transport; its changing draft status is not an internal
implementation dependency and has not been revalidated for this rewrite.

## 7. Implementation sequence and checks

The implementation is sequenced by shared lifecycle, reading, search/install,
writes, checkout, and UI. This specification describes the public boundaries;
internal work tracking is maintained separately.

1. **Set the shared content/write boundary.** Resolve identity, migration and
   ownership, and the simplified Skill Learning path. Choose one write authority
   and define how legacy registry callers reach it. Do not lose scopes, active
   state, history, or source ownership while converting text entries to folders.
2. **Read without a sandbox.** Add the eager reader, short catalog and readable
   built-in management Skill. Adapt current sources without breaking native,
   repository or session Skills. Verify omitted/explicit paths, missing files,
   bounded output, and a no-sandbox session. Separately measure whether ordinary
   worker startup still provisions a sandbox; lazy file loading is not proof
   that startup is avoided.
   Implement the bundled selector described above in this slice, using
   individual synchronous inclusion rules and one effective set across all
   delivery paths. Add a stalled-lazy-discovery first-request test; do not gate
   descriptors on `hasCanonicalEditableArtifactToolSurface`. Coordinate the
   embedding contract and child/schedule inheritance before exposing overrides.
3. **Direct saving and migration.** Add lazy file saves through the shared write
   lifecycle, preserve omitted files, record history and handle stale writes.
   Move registry writes and UI editing to that same authority, or use a bounded
   compatibility adapter. Verify all three Learning modes, human access checks,
   cross-workspace denial, retries, restore, and legacy read/write convergence.
4. **Search and install.** Integrate a real discovery provider, pin source bytes
   server-side and install through the same governance. Verify discovery versus
   URL resolution, unsupported-file errors, source failures, duplicate names,
   mode behavior, and protection of customized or Plugin-owned Skills.
5. **Checkout and publish.** Materialize only on demand; publish directories
   through the same revision service. Verify round trips, explicit deletions,
   safe paths, no symlink escape, unchanged-file preservation and stale edits.
6. **Unified UI and cutover.** Capabilities and Agent Knowledge project the same
   catalog. Provide simple editing and history; retain approval behavior without
   requiring a new elaborate inbox. Remove obsolete prompts/tools only after
   compatibility tests pass. Test migration and deployment with old callers,
   document supported recovery, and reconcile the architecture documentation.

Implementation is authorized by the subsequent user confirmation. UI convergence
may land alongside writes; do not leave a second live editor until the end.

## 8. Retention and remaining verification

**Approved retention rule (September 9, 2026):** deleting a workspace deletes
its workspace-owned Skills and their history. Organization/personal Skills and
other workspaces' Skills remain untouched. History remains immutable while the
workspace exists; approval of this rule does not authorize deletion of any live
workspace or relax instruction-policy retention.

The unified cutover must preserve workspace deletion for installed-only
workspaces. Verification must cover authored and installed Skills, inactive
proposals, revisions/events, source bindings, write and conversion receipts,
and references from surviving scopes. Changing one foreign key is insufficient.
Keep ordinary runtime history deletion forbidden and prove isolation through
the real authorized workspace-deletion path. Implementation and verification
of this boundary are required before shipping the migration.

The shared schema, Learning write rules, text validation, save/publication
concurrency, and source compatibility are specified above and implemented on the
working branch. The remaining integration and verification gates are recorded
in section 5; they are not new product decisions or claims of completion.

Deferred rather than blocking this iteration: remote pre-install reading,
Skills-over-MCP transport, automatic upstream merging, sophisticated review UI,
new personal/org agent-write scope, and dedicated agent uninstall tooling.
No binary-file support or session-level read-version pinning is planned here.

## 9. Completion criteria

This design is implemented only when agents can read without a sandbox, discover
lazy management tools through the built-in Skill, install and edit text Skills
under the configured Learning mode, and use direct editing or checkout against
one shared content/history system. Both UI destinations must agree; migrations
must preserve existing behavior and customized Skills must survive source updates.
Passing a single no-sandbox read test is not completion of the full system.
