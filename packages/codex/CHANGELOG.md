# @opengeni/codex

## 0.2.29

### Patch Changes

- 8019cac: A Codex request for a model the resolver doesn't recognize is sent unchanged, so the provider rejects it visibly. Previously it was silently rewritten to the first fallback model (`gpt-6-astra`). For example, a session set to `codex/gpt-6.1-sol` ran on Astra without any indication. The resolver now also matches against the active catalog's exact upstream slugs.
- e14db2a: Recognize a ChatGPT account whose plan no longer includes the requested Codex
  model (an explicit plan refusal, `usage_not_included`, or an empty HTTP 400).
  The worker re-checks the account's current plan, excludes that account for that
  model only, and moves the same turn to another eligible account, or fails with a
  typed `codex_plan_entitlement` or `codex_request_rejected` code and plain copy.
  Plan metadata now refreshes from token refreshes and usage reads, a plan change
  is recorded as lasting evidence, the remote compaction request takes the same
  path, and each exclusion expires after 24 hours. Codex accounts report
  `planCheckedAt`, `planChangedFrom`, `planChangedAt`, and `planExcludedModels`.
- e917ce3: Update the Codex client identity to 0.159.2 so model discovery and inference can access GPT-6.1 Sol.

## 0.2.26

### Patch Changes

- d0b5efd: Preserve provider-hosted tool call status through history persistence and Codex request normalization. Hosted search, code interpreter and image-generation calls require this field on replay; function and message annotations retain their existing compatibility behavior.
- Updated dependencies [23f4717]
  - @opengeni/contracts@5.1.1

## 0.2.25

### Patch Changes

- a642885: Update the reviewed Codex client version to stable 0.156.0, keeping discovery query and transport identity aligned.

## 0.2.24

### Patch Changes

- c387603: Classify streaming response completion after parsing the final SSE block, so successful responses without a trailing blank separator do not produce false failed-request telemetry. Preserve genuine missing-terminal and provider failures and exactly one terminal audit event per attempt.
- ac006ef: Add opt-in durable GPT-6 Astra reasoning effort updates with a stable request-level baseline, retry fencing, SDK replay, and explicit compaction restoration. Disabled by default pending live backend verification.

## 0.2.23

### Patch Changes

- 750060c: Support inline HTML visualizations, retained images, and embedded Sites in chat. Add a plain HTML Site client, preserve application request headers through the shared bridge, document visualization workflows, and use Image 2.5 Sunburst for Codex image generation.

## 0.2.22

### Patch Changes

- 694c1ff: Add GPT-6 Astra to the static Codex subscription catalog using the current Codex client version and the existing 272k context policy.

## 0.2.20

### Patch Changes

- 4fb337b: Reconcile stale Codex quota cooldowns from authoritative live usage without clearing generic rate limits or concurrently newer refusals.

## 0.2.19

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [16387c3]
  - @opengeni/network@0.2.3

## 0.2.18

### Patch Changes

- 1cd0eb0: Omit Responses output-only item `status` when persisting conversation history, and omit opaque `encrypted_content` from the portable compaction temporary copy, so SuperGrok-origin portable sessions can continue and compact on Codex. Keep the Codex wire strip as defense for already-stored rows and mid-turn SDK items. Durable history is not rewritten on a model switch.

## 0.2.17

### Patch Changes

- 944be7f: Reduce and attribute turn startup latency with lazy sandbox defaults for local development, bounded validator reuse, parallel durable input reads, exact stale-Docker recovery, and low-cardinality worker, runtime, credential, and provider preparation diagnostics.

## 0.2.16

### Patch Changes

- 73d34d6: Fence provider model-request terminal outcomes and expose bounded request lifecycle diagnostics for headers, first byte, and semantic completion.

## 0.2.15

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [2f4ce5e]
  - @opengeni/network@0.2.2

## 0.2.14

### Patch Changes

- e2edfbc: Add provider-aware image generation with permanent verified artifacts,
  prompt-cache-safe history, sandbox materialization, and SDK/React rendering.
- 7f70d33: Bound long-running service memory, upgrade the OpenAI Agents SDK to 0.14.3, and preserve exact provider, streaming, and durable-resume semantics.
- Updated dependencies [e2edfbc]
  - @opengeni/network@0.2.1

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- 43d45c6: Keep saved voice recordings on their original retry deadline during live UI renders, and normalize connector tool results whose optional structured payload is null without changing tool routing.

## 0.2.12

### Patch Changes

- 30a0b9a: Preserve internal content exactly, replace heuristic rewriting with lossless persistence, and keep public telemetry on reviewed structural projections.

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- 69bc207: Keep Codex history canonical across subscriptions and providers, separate optional owner-designated Codex Apps authority from inference allocation, and fence Apps authorization through each remote request.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 4f15920: Add an authorized, server-mediated connected-Codex GPT-Live V3 WebRTC SDP path with credential-safe negotiation and browser lifecycle helpers.

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- c52acc0: Ship Fast latency mode with turn-column inheritance, Codex ChatGPT honor-skip for response service_tier, and model picker UX polish.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 6d167f4: Recover exact Codex encrypted-artifact rejections without deleting durable conversation truth, and make maintenance migration protocol activation part of the canonical migration transaction.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- bdd531c: Make Codex subscription response timeouts recoverable without blindly replaying partially observed model work. The transport now assigns a durable request identity, records attempt-fenced start/headers/first-byte/terminal metadata, enforces explicit headers, stream-idle, and whole-request deadlines, and retries once only before any response is observed. Exhausted or partial-stream timeouts retain a typed failure class and return the durable session to its existing retryable recovery path instead of hard-failing it with the opaque OpenAI SDK `Request timed out.` error. External cancellation remains authoritative, the SDK retry budget remains disabled, and Codex subscription turns keep their existing zero-credit billing path.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 229902b: Add trustworthy per-subscription Codex quota/reset-credit overview and allocator OCC controls, plus an owning-human managed-cookie-only reset redemption flow with durable ambiguity-safe provider idempotency.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 14ce2e3: Bound model-facing textual tool output with Codex-compatible, replay-idempotent semantics, account
  for complete current model input, make compaction failure/progress transitions
  durable and convergent, and replace recursive session discovery with a compact
  paginated projection.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 6882ff2: Reuse the failed turn identity across database and workflow child-terminal producers so one failure cannot enqueue two parent updates. Bind the Codex subscription client header and compaction documentation to latest stable Codex CLI 0.144.5.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- ec508d4: Proactive context compaction now actually fires on the codex-subscription path: codex models declare their real (empirically measured) context window instead of inheriting the 1.05M global default, and the default compaction trigger moves from 60% to 90% of the declared window — compact as late as possible now that the window base is honest, with the reactive compact-on-reject ladder absorbing any overshoot.
- 58c78c6: Send a stable `session_id` header on every codex-subscription request. This is the backend's sticky prompt-cache-routing key: measured with byte-identical ~99k-token gpt-5.6-sol requests on one idle account, repeat requests WITHOUT the header hit the prompt cache only ~50% of the time (a per-request routing lottery across cache shards — matching the production fleet's 48.6% token-weighted hit rate), while WITH a stable session_id 10/10 requests hit at the 99.0% ceiling. Codex CLI always sends this header (its own last-3-days token-weighted rate on the same account is 94%); `prompt_cache_key` in the body only influences routing and does not pin it. The worker supplies the OpenGeni sessionId — the same value already used for `prompt_cache_key` — so routing and cache key agree, and the compaction summarizer (same request context) rides the same warm shard. Requests without a session context are unchanged.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2170732: Publish the full Stage C `@opengeni/*` runtime closure to npm so external hosts can consume OpenGeni from published packages instead of vendored workspace tarballs.

  The release pipeline now builds every publishable package, rewrites every published `workspace:*` dependency to a concrete semver range, rewrites source entry points to dist entry points for every publishable package, and leaves only leaf-only non-runtime packages ignored.
