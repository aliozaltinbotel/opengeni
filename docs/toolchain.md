# Toolchain

The fast path for contributors: what runs typecheck, lint, and format, and why.

## Package manager & runtime

**Bun 1.4** end to end — install, run, test, and script execution. `.bun-version` is the
canonical exact pin; `bun run check:bun-version` verifies every package, workflow, container,
and native-builder mirror. There is no `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` lockfile in this repo; use
`bun install`, `bun run <script>`, and `bun test`.

Specialized build boundaries remain explicit:

- publishable libraries use `tsup` (esbuild) for release-shaped ESM and stable TypeScript 7
  `tsc` for declarations. Bun 1.4.0's bundler emitted invalid ESM for the re-export-heavy SDK
  and React barrels during migration validation, so this stays until that correctness defect is
  fixed and the full external-consumer matrix proves parity;
- `apps/web` uses Vite/Rolldown because TanStack Router and Tailwind provide supported Vite
  plugins and Opengeni's payload budgets depend on custom Rolldown chunk groups;
- Temporal owns the deterministic workflow webpack bundle consumed by its Worker API;
- `packages/ogtool` uses Bun's bundler for its portable all-in-one CommonJS executable.

The one intentional package-manager exception is the registry transport inside
`bun run release:publish`. Bun launches the local Changesets CLI, while Changesets invokes
`npm publish` for the actual registry push. That's deliberate — `bun publish` cannot emit npm
provenance attestations, so the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) sets up Node
and npm for that one boundary only. Do not replace the provenance-capable publish transport
until Bun can emit equivalent registry attestations.

## Typecheck: stable TypeScript 7

Typecheck runs on the exact pinned stable **TypeScript 7** `tsc`. `bun run typecheck` invokes
`bun scripts/typecheck.ts`, which launches the Node-hosted compiler over every project's
`tsconfig.json` with a bounded worker pool. The scheduler retains its established Node
child-process boundary because Bun-native variants produced no repeatable performance benefit in
the isolated migration benchmark. Per-package `typecheck` scripts invoke the same compiler.
Preview compiler packages and executables are not part of the toolchain.

Publishable packages use `scripts/build-typescript-package.ts`: `tsup` still creates JavaScript
and source maps, then stable TypeScript 7 `tsc` emits declarations. This split is intentional;
`tsup` 8's declaration bundler requires the legacy JavaScript compiler API, which stable
TypeScript 7 no longer exports. The generated package declarations remain release-gated by the
external-consumer and publish-closure tests.

CI runs the same `bun run typecheck` step (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so there is nothing
special to configure locally beyond `bun install`.

## Lint: oxlint

**oxlint** is the linter — a greenfield add (there was never an ESLint/Prettier/Biome config in
this repo). `bun run lint` runs it and CI gates on it (0 errors; warnings are advisory). Config is
`.oxlintrc.json` at the repo root: a lean plugin set (`react`, `react-hooks`, `typescript`,
`import`) to stay clear of the multi-plugin perf cliff. Notable rule choices:

- `react/react-in-jsx-scope` off (React 19's automatic JSX runtime — no `import React` needed).
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` at `warn` (oxlint asks for whole-object deps where the intent is
  member-level; audit before adding a dep, don't mass-autofix).
- `no-control-regex` off (this repo's control-char sanitizers legitimately match them, and even the
  recommended `\u`-escape form trips the rule).
- A test-scoped override drops `no-unsafe-optional-chaining` to `warn` and turns off
  `no-this-alias` — both fire only on test scaffolding, so the rules stay strict for `src`.

Warnings are intentionally non-blocking. Run `bun run lint` locally to see them.

## Format: oxfmt

**oxfmt** is the formatter (Prettier-compatible output, printWidth 100). `bun run format` writes,
`bun run format:check` verifies, and CI gates on `format:check`. Config is `.oxfmtrc.json`, scoped
to **TS/JS/JSON only**. It deliberately excludes markdown/YAML/TOML/CSS, `*.d.ts`, generated files
(`*.gen.*`), drizzle migrations/meta, the golden event-grammar fixtures, all `fixtures/` and
`evidence/` directories, and the Rust `agent/` crate — reformatting byte-exact fixtures or
templated YAML would break tests or Helm rendering. If you add a new byte-exact fixture directory,
add it to `ignorePatterns`.

## Where this fits

For the full local check sequence contributors run before opening a PR, see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md#checks). This doc is intentionally narrow: it explains
*which tool* does typecheck/lint/format and why, not the day-to-day contributor workflow.
