# OpenGeni Azure Reference Deployment

This Terraform root module is the Azure reference substrate for OpenGeni. It is intentionally focused on platform primitives and does not store application secrets in source control.

## What It Creates

- Resource group, when `create_resource_group = true`.
- Azure Container Registry.
- AKS cluster with OIDC issuer and workload identity enabled.
- Optional dedicated autoscaling AKS user pool for OpenSandbox workload Pods.
- Azure Key Vault with RBAC authorization enabled.
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server when `postgres.mode = "managed"`.
- `pgcrypto`, `pgvector`, and `btree_gin` enablement for managed Postgres through the `azure.extensions` server configuration. `btree_gin` is required by the upstream Temporal PostgreSQL visibility schema.
- Optional PostgreSQL firewall rules through `postgres.allow_azure_services` or `postgres.firewall_rules`.
- Optional managed PostgreSQL high availability, custom maintenance window, pinned `max_connections`, and CPU/connection saturation alerts (see the Managed PostgreSQL sections below).
- Azure Storage account and private Blob container when `object_storage.mode = "managed"` and `object_storage.api = "azure-blob"`.
- ACR pull role assignment for AKS kubelet identity.
- Optional AKS Microsoft Defender attachment to an existing Log Analytics workspace.
- Optional namespace-scoped AKS Container Insights log collection into the observability Log Analytics workspace, with a mandatory daily ingestion cap.

Connected Machines (`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=selfhosted`) add one more deployed
component, the `opengeni-relay` stream relay. Its image is pushed to the same
Azure Container Registry as the API/worker/web images (no extra registry
resource is required). The relay pairs each channel's producer and consumer in a
per-replica in-memory registry, so its public wss ingress must route both dials
for a channel to the same replica (consistent-hash / session affinity keyed on
the channel) whenever more than one relay replica runs. See `docs/deployment.md`
(Connected Machines) for the full relay/NATS/secret wiring.

## Phases

Use `deployment_phase = "bootstrap"` to create cloud substrate before runtime dependencies are known. Bootstrap mode does not require Temporal, object storage, or external Postgres endpoints unless those resources are being created by Terraform.

Use `deployment_phase = "complete"` when rendering or applying a fully configured deployment. Complete mode requires all external runtime endpoints, except `temporal.mode = "officialChart"` uses the stack-wrapper managed upstream Temporal service endpoint.

## Existing Services

Use existing customer infrastructure by setting:

```hcl
postgres = {
  mode          = "external"
  existing_host = "customer-postgres.postgres.database.azure.com"
}

temporal = {
  mode          = "external"
  existing_host = "customer-temporal.example.com:7233"
  namespace     = "default"
  task_queue    = "opengeni-runs-ts"
}

object_storage = {
  mode = "external"
  api  = "azure-blob"
}
```

External mode means Terraform does not create that dependency. The Helm values or secret manager integration must still provide the runtime values expected by OpenGeni, such as `OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` for Azure Blob.

## AKS Capacity and staged rollout

The `aks` object is the one authoritative model for the system pool. It owns
node count, VM size, autoscaling, bounds, pod density, OS disk settings, and
rotation name. Fixed pools keep an explicit `node_count`; autoscaled pools keep
`node_count` as a validation anchor but omit it from the AzureRM resource
configuration. AzureRM 4.72.0 then retains the provider-reported live count
instead of attempting an unsupported `node_count` update on an existing
autoscaled pool.

A fixed pool is still configured directly:

```hcl
aks = {
  node_count = 5
}
```

An already-existing fixed pool must not jump directly to an unbounded or
rotation-sensitive configuration. Use the `bounds` phase, explicitly attest
that the refreshed pool is still fixed, preserve every rotation-sensitive
field, and bind `node_count` to the exact live count. The live count must fit
inside the requested bounds, so enabling autoscaling cannot immediately create
nodes beyond the reviewed maximum. Terraform then omits `node_count` from the
desired autoscaled resource and lets Azure own the converging live count.

```hcl
aks_existing_pool = true

aks = {
  node_count           = 6
  vm_size              = "Standard_D4ds_v4"
  auto_scaling_enabled = true
  min_count            = 3
  max_count            = 6
  max_pods             = 30
  os_disk_size_gb      = 128
  os_disk_type         = "Managed"
  temporary_name_for_rotation = null
}

aks_rollout = {
  phase = "bounds"
  expected_existing = {
    auto_scaling_enabled        = false
    vm_size                     = "Standard_D4ds_v4"
    max_pods                    = 30
    os_disk_size_gb             = 128
    os_disk_type                = "Managed"
    temporary_name_for_rotation = null
  }
}
```

Review the saved plan and require an in-place update limited to autoscaling and
its bounds. After apply, refresh provider state and verify the live count is
inside the bounds before any later bounds or rotation change.

For the observed staging pool, phase 1 must change only autoscaling bounds. The
SKU, pod density, managed-disk type, and rotation name below are the existing
live settings and are repeated to make accidental rotation visible in the
plan. The staging composition must set `aks_existing_pool = true`; omitting
`aks_rollout` then fails closed instead of silently selecting the new-cluster
`direct` phase. Do not add the later replacement SKU or temporary pool in this
phase.

```hcl
aks_existing_pool = true

aks = {
  node_count           = 3
  vm_size              = "Standard_D4ds_v4"
  auto_scaling_enabled = true
  min_count            = 3
  max_count            = 3
  max_pods             = 30
  os_disk_size_gb      = 128
  os_disk_type         = "Managed"
  temporary_name_for_rotation = null
}

aks_rollout = {
  phase = "bounds"
  expected_existing = {
    auto_scaling_enabled = true
    vm_size      = "Standard_D4ds_v4"
    max_pods     = 30
    os_disk_size_gb = 128
    os_disk_type = "Managed"
    temporary_name_for_rotation = null
  }
}
```

`aks_rollout.phase = "bounds"` reads the existing `system` pool through the
AzureRM node-pool data source and requires both the expected snapshot and direct
`aks` rotation-sensitive fields to match that refreshed live state. Autoscaling
must remain enabled and rotation settings must remain null. The official staging
apply owner must
first confirm authoritative state ownership, resolve the pool's health, clean
up or reschedule the observed workload so three nodes can fit, and take a
rollback point. After the bounds-only apply, wait for the autoscaler and refresh
state until the live/provider count is 3. Recheck provisioning state, regional
quota, Azure CNI/IP capacity, PDB and drain behavior, and the four bound RWO
disks before considering any replacement.

Only a separately reviewed follow-up may use the rotation phase. Its saved plan
would carry the refreshed count and quota evidence explicitly:

```hcl
aks = {
  node_count                  = 3
  vm_size                     = "Standard_E4as_v6"
  auto_scaling_enabled        = true
  min_count                   = 3
  max_count                   = 3
  max_pods                    = 60
  os_disk_size_gb             = 128
  os_disk_type                = "Managed"
  temporary_name_for_rotation = "systemtemp"
}

aks_rollout = {
  phase = "rotation"
  rotation_preflight = {
    observed_node_count    = 3
    regional_vcpu_used     = 66
    regional_vcpu_limit    = 80
    rotation_vcpu_per_node = 4
  }
}
```

The module rejects rotation unless the caller's observed count exactly matches
the refreshed live/provider node-pool count, that live count is within the
requested bounds, and the temporary-pool peak—calculated from the live count—fits
the supplied regional quota headroom. For the example, the modeled peak is
78/80 vCPU. The follow-up still
requires an operator-reviewed read-only plan, RWO drain/reattach and rollback
evidence, and a fresh quota/SKU/preflight check. These settings are operational
guardrails, not a cost-savings claim; actual savings require authoritative
billing evidence.

### Optional OpenSandbox user pool

`sandbox_node_pool.enabled` is false by default, so existing Modal deployments
and system-pool plans remain unchanged. When enabled, Terraform creates a
separate Linux `User` pool with Cluster Autoscaler, including scale-to-zero when
`min_count = 0`. The pool has the fixed scheduling contract used by the pinned
OpenSandbox BatchSandbox template:

- label: `opengeni.ai/sandbox-pool=opensandbox`
- taint: `opengeni.ai/sandbox=true:NoSchedule`

OpenGeni/control components do not tolerate that taint. OpenSandbox workload
Pods require both the label and toleration, preventing sandbox load from
competing with the AKS system pool by default. This is capacity/autoscaling
isolation, not a tenant-security boundary.

```hcl
sandbox_node_pool = {
  enabled         = true
  name            = "sandbox"
  vm_size         = "Standard_D4ds_v5"
  min_count       = 0
  max_count       = 20
  max_pods        = 110
  zones           = ["1", "2", "3"]
  os_disk_size_gb = 128
  os_disk_type    = "Ephemeral"
}
```

Treat 5, 50, and 500 sandbox tests as separate capacity profiles. Compute
`max_count` from sandbox CPU/memory requests, daemon overhead, pod/IP density,
target utilization, disruption margin, regional vCPU quota, and the test's hard
cost ceiling. A lightweight 500-sandbox result is not evidence for 500
desktop-class rigs.

## Container Logs (Container Insights)

Kubernetes keeps container stdout/stderr only for the lifetime of each pod.
`aks_container_insights` retains it in the observability Log Analytics
workspace, so it requires `observability.enabled = true`:

```hcl
aks_container_insights = {
  enabled                  = true
  namespaces               = ["opengeni", "opengeni-platform"]
  workspace_daily_quota_gb = 5
}
```

When enabled, Terraform:

- Enables the AKS monitoring addon (`oms_agent`) with managed-identity
  ingestion (`msi_auth_for_monitoring_enabled = true`).
- Creates one data collection rule, `MSCI-<location>-<cluster>`, and associates
  it to the cluster as `ContainerInsightsExtension`, the exact name Container
  Insights looks up.
- Collects only the listed namespaces (`namespaceFilteringMode = "Include"`).
  The default streams are the logs-and-events preset: `ContainerLogV2`,
  `KubeEvents`, and `KubePodInventory`. `data_collection_interval` (default
  `5m`) governs inventory sampling, not log latency.
- Sets `daily_quota_gb` on the workspace. The cap is required: a log loop must
  not produce an unbounded bill. When it is reached, the workspace stops
  ingesting until its daily reset, including Application Insights data that
  shares the workspace, so set it well above normal ingestion.
- Creates the `<name_prefix>-logs-daily-cap` scheduled query alert. It reads
  `_LogOperation`, which is not subject to the cap, and notifies the
  observability action group when ingestion stops for the day. It evaluates
  every 15 minutes over a one-hour window, so a late-arriving `OverQuota`
  record is still counted, and mutes repeat notifications for six hours.
- Creates the `<name_prefix>-logs-collection-stopped` scheduled query alert.
  It fires when no `ContainerLogV2` line from the listed namespaces arrived in
  the last 30 minutes (a deleted association, an agent that cannot
  authenticate, or the addon removed out of band) and resolves when collection
  resumes. List at least one namespace that always logs.
- Optionally applies `container_log_transform_kql`, an ingestion-time
  [transformation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-transformations)
  that runs only on `ContainerLogV2`, in its own data flow into the standard
  table. Use it to redact values that must not be retained, such as request
  query strings in ingress access logs. It must start with `source` and may use
  only the KQL that transformations support; Azure validates it when the rule
  is created or updated.

Retention is the workspace's 30 days. Query retained pod output with KQL, for
example:

```kusto
ContainerLogV2
| where PodNamespace == "opengeni" and PodName startswith "opengeni-api-"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project TimeGenerated, PodName, ContainerName, LogSource, LogMessage
```

The addon runs a DaemonSet and one ReplicaSet in `kube-system` with CPU and
memory requests on every node. Check node request headroom before enabling it
on a saturated pool. Disabling the object removes the addon, the rule, the
association, and the cap; data already ingested remains until retention
expires.

## Managed PostgreSQL Capacity

Keep non-secret production capacity separate from the credential-bearing `postgres`
object. This lets private deployment automation pin the live capacity without
copying or rewriting the administrator password:

```hcl
managed_postgres_capacity = {
  sku_name          = "GP_Standard_D4ds_v5"
  storage_mb        = 131072
  storage_tier      = "P10"
  auto_grow_enabled = true
}
```

When set, this policy is authoritative for managed PostgreSQL compute and
storage. When omitted, the existing `postgres.sku_name` and
`postgres.storage_mb` behavior is unchanged and provider defaults apply to
storage tier and autogrow.

`max_connections` is optional. Azure computes the default from the memory of
the SKU the server was created with and does not change it when compute is
scaled later, so a server created small keeps a small connection limit after a
scale-up. When set, Terraform manages the static `max_connections` parameter.
The azurerm provider restarts the server whenever it first adopts or changes
that value, so change it only inside a planned maintenance step. When the
server has read replicas, raise the replica's `max_connections` (and compute)
first: Azure requires replicas to be at least as large as the primary for
`max_connections`, `max_worker_processes`, and related parameters.

## Managed PostgreSQL Availability

`managed_postgres_availability` adds a high-availability standby and a custom
planned-maintenance window without touching the credential-bearing `postgres`
object:

```hcl
managed_postgres_availability = {
  high_availability = {
    mode = "ZoneRedundant" # or "SameZone"
  }
  maintenance_window = {
    day_of_week  = 3 # 0 = Sunday, UTC
    start_hour   = 2
    start_minute = 0
  }
  update_timeout = "120m" # Terraform update timeout for the server
}
```

Null (the default) keeps high availability disabled and lets Azure choose the
maintenance window. Enabling HA on an existing server is an online operation,
but it provisions and seeds a standby, so do it while write activity is low.
Zone-redundant HA needs a General Purpose or Memory Optimized SKU in a region
with availability zones.

Seeding the standby can outlast the provider's 60-minute update timeout. Set
`update_timeout` (a whole number of minutes or hours) so Terraform keeps
polling instead of failing the apply while Azure is still working, and give the
automation that runs the apply a longer bound than this value. Azure changes a
custom maintenance window only from the next monthly cycle; a maintenance that
was already notified keeps its scheduled time.

With HA enabled, Azure fails over to the standby for planned maintenance and
for unplanned outages, which swaps the primary and standby zones. The server
resource therefore ignores later changes to `zone` and
`high_availability[0].standby_availability_zone`, so a plan never tries to fail
back or rejects a zone Azure moved. Use a planned failover when the primary
should return to a preferred zone. For the same reason
`standby_availability_zone` is used only when HA is first enabled; to move the
standby later, use a planned failover or disable and re-enable HA.

## Managed PostgreSQL Alerts

`managed_postgres_alerts` creates Azure Monitor metric alerts on the managed
server and routes them to the `observability` action group, so it requires
`postgres.mode = "managed"` and `observability.enabled = true`:

```hcl
managed_postgres_alerts = {
  max_connections     = 429 # the server's effective max_connections
  cpu_percent         = 80
  connections_percent = 80
  severity            = 2
}
```

- CPU: average `cpu_percent` above `cpu_percent` for 15 minutes.
- Connections: maximum `active_connections` above
  `floor(max_connections * connections_percent / 100)` over 5 minutes. Azure
  exposes connections only as an absolute count, so `max_connections` must
  match the live parameter. It defaults to
  `managed_postgres_capacity.max_connections` when that is pinned.

## Resource Records

Before applying this module, decide where the operator will keep exact resource
names, cleanup notes, and generated access material. Keep those records outside
the repository along with Terraform state, plans, kubeconfigs, and filled
tfvars.

## Safe Defaults

- Default region is `westeurope`. If Azure PostgreSQL is offer-restricted there for the active subscription, set `postgres.location` to an allowed region such as `northeurope` while keeping the rest of the stack in the primary region.
- Default AKS node count is 2.
- AKS node-pool upgrades default to Azure's standard `10%` max surge and can be overridden through the `aks` object.
- If `aks.microsoft_defender_log_analytics_workspace_id` is set, Terraform enables the AKS Microsoft Defender block. The workspace ID field is ignored after creation because Azure may normalize resource ID casing in plan output.
- Key Vault purge protection defaults to enabled for production-like usage. Disable it only for short-lived evaluation resources that must be deleted immediately.
- ACR pull role assignment defaults to enabled. Set `create_acr_pull_role_assignment = false` if the current Azure identity cannot create role assignments; in that case an operator with RBAC permissions must grant AKS `AcrPull` before private images can run.
- Deployment automation identities that call `az aks get-credentials --admin`
  must be supplied through `aks_admin_principal_ids` so Terraform grants the
  Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role on the created AKS cluster. Do not
  patch this permission manually and then claim the environment is reproducible;
  if the private ops workflow cannot load AKS credentials from its configured
  Azure OIDC identity, the deployment is not ready.
- Deployment automation identities that create or update public app DNS records
  must be supplied through `dns_zone_contributor_assignments` so Terraform
  grants DNS Zone Contributor on the exact Azure DNS zone. Do not manually patch
  DNS RBAC after a failed deploy and then claim the environment is reproducible;
  if the private ops workflow cannot set the configured app A record, the
  deployment is not ready.
- Object storage defaults to managed Azure Blob for Azure reference deployments with private container access, nested public blob access disabled, blob versioning enabled, and seven-day blob/container delete retention. The sensitive connection string is exposed only as a sensitive Terraform output and should be written to Key Vault or a Kubernetes Secret, not source control.
- Temporal can be `external` for Temporal Cloud/customer endpoints or `officialChart` for the stack-wrapper managed upstream Temporal chart. The chart still needs durable Postgres persistence prepared outside the OpenGeni app chart.
- For temporary AKS/Flexible Server smoke tests, `postgres.allow_azure_services = true` can unblock Azure-internal access. Prefer private networking or tightly scoped `postgres.firewall_rules` for long-lived deployments.
- If a failed Azure PostgreSQL create reserves a server name without leaving an importable resource, set `postgres.name` to a new cleanup-friendly name and rerun the private-state plan. Terraform ignores later `zone` changes on the managed server (Azure assigns a zone at create time and HA failover can move it), so `postgres.zone` only affects server creation.

If Terraform cannot create role assignments, ask an operator with sufficient Azure RBAC permissions to run:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$(terraform output -raw aks_kubelet_object_id)" \
  --role AcrPull \
  --scope "$(az acr show --name "$(terraform output -raw acr_login_server | cut -d. -f1)" --query id -o tsv)"
```

Until that is done, use a temporary Kubernetes image pull secret only for private evaluation.

For deployment automation identity access, prefer setting
`aks_admin_principal_ids` and reapplying Terraform. A direct `az role
assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"` command
is break-glass only and must be followed by codifying the principal ID in the
private tfvars/state before readiness can be claimed.

For workflow-managed DNS records, prefer setting
`dns_zone_contributor_assignments` and reapplying Terraform. A direct `az role
assignment create --role "DNS Zone Contributor"` command is break-glass only and
must be followed by codifying the DNS zone and principal ID in the private
tfvars/state before readiness can be claimed.

## Example

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan \
  -var 'deployment_phase=complete' \
  -var 'name_prefix=opengeni-dev' \
  -var 'resource_group_name=rg-opengeni-dev' \
  -var 'postgres={"mode":"external","existing_host":"existing.postgres.database.azure.com"}' \
  -var 'temporal={"mode":"officialChart","namespace":"default","task_queue":"opengeni-runs-ts"}' \
  -var 'object_storage={"mode":"managed","api":"azure-blob","bucket":"opengeni-files"}'
```

Do not commit `terraform.tfvars`, `.terraform/`, plans, state files, kubeconfigs, or generated credentials.
