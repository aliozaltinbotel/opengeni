# Insights unified DB API checkpoint

Migration `0604_insights_raw_usage_api.sql` is rolling and independent of the
unfinished daily-rollup migration. It adds nullable captured class annotations
and two scoped read capabilities. Released readers, authorization policies,
permission checks, billing writes, pricing/catalog definitions and ledger rows
are unchanged. No historical total is repriced.

`readInsightsUsage` and `readInsightsCalls` accept `(db, { accountId,
workspaceId: string | null, query, now, detailsWorkspaceIds?: readonly string[],
detailsSharedWorkspaces?: boolean })`. A null workspace selects organization
scope. The result is the existing `@opengeni/contracts/insights-usage` response.
All six preset UTC ranges and the original grouping/filter/cursor fields are
supported. Source/plan/session dimensions and custom dates remain preserved
follow-up work: these queries return HTTP 400 rather than silently using a
different window or dimension. The interim response omits `facets.sources`.

Core must supply authenticated detail authority, not wire fields: workspace
routes pass their sessions:read-authorized workspace; organization routes pass
their actual same-account/same-subject workspace grants. Shared-all must come
only from the existing stamped account-scoped API-key authority proof with
sessions:read and an all-workspaces scope. Selected keys pass exactly their
canonical selected IDs instead; explicit workspace:admin never substitutes for
literal sessions:read. Workspace endpoint permission gates are unchanged,
but detail authority is independently intersected. Billing/account administration
alone grants no detail access.
Shared-all never admits Personal workspaces. The cursor binds these flags.

Live session/root/project/person/schedule metadata is projected only after
actor and detail-authority masking. Hidden Only-me and other Personal amounts
are aggregated inside the owner capability by kind/opaque person/payer/bucket,
not returned per hidden call. Private/Personal rows are not identity-filterable;
facets contain only visible metadata. Deleted and restricted usage are distinct.
Call details are visible-only, with filtering before cursor and limit.

Charged amounts come only from negative `model_usage_debit` / `model_response`
credit-ledger entries, matched by `turnId:sourceKey`. Requested fact prices are
not actual debits. Unmatched workspace/account charges retain their money in
restricted buckets with zero calls/tokens and no fabricated model attribution.
Successful JSON responses have a bounded, process-local 60-second cache, so
amounts can be up to 60 seconds stale. Cache hits preserve `generatedAt` and
`dataThrough`. Every request reauthenticates and reauthorizes; keys partition by
account/workspace, normalized query, authenticated credential/principal and
current selected-workspace/session-read ceilings. The existing committed
session-activity revision plus current shared inventory/project/schedule metadata
fences private/deleted/moved identities before a hit. Unavailable fence metadata
disables caching. Credentials are HMAC-digested, not retained as cache keys.
The cache holds at most 128 entries/8 MiB, with a 1 MiB per-response limit; hits
do not extend TTL, failures are never cached, and browser cache control is
`private, no-store`. `x-opengeni-insights-max-staleness-seconds: 60` discloses the
upper bound. Existing transaction-local 10-second statement cancellation maps
to HTTP 408 in the normal error envelope: `Range too large, try 7 days.`
Usage totals follow each debit's ledger `occurredAt` in the selected period;
call details follow the fact's `occurredAt` and show lifetime debits linked to
that call, including a later clipped debit. These are different clocks: summing
call rows is not period-ledger reconciliation. No requested price is substituted
and a delayed debit is retained in its actual period even without period facts.
Cursor timestamps are always UTC with all six PostgreSQL fractional digits,
independent of the database connection timezone.

Usage reads decode measure columns once before aggregation and deduplicate only
visible facet metadata. Totals and ingestion watermarks retain every authorized
source row. The prior and current windows run as separate statements in the same
actor-scoped transaction, each retaining the 10-second statement timeout; this
avoids spending one statement's entire allowance across both independent scans.
It does not accelerate the raw authority functions or guarantee that larger
periods fit within the bound.

Captured class annotations must conserve the recorded provider estimate. NULL
telemetry is not zero, including cache-write telemetry. This interim checkpoint
does not perform historical allocation: eligible fixed-total allocation using
the separately approved current-catalog snapshot remains the rollup follow-up.

This is an intentionally raw-backed endpoint-first checkpoint: full-day/YTD
scans are not yet accelerated and no staging p95 claim is made. Contract
follow-up 3296 permits a money-only prior with zero recorded calls; the DB and
routes retain that money rather than inventing calls or dropping it. A truly
empty prior is null.

Focused real PostgreSQL coverage uses a NOSUPERUSER/NOBYPASSRLS migration owner
and restricted application role, with historical facts before the migration,
both scopes, all ranges/groupings, clipped/orphan debit conservation, strict
privacy/authority ceilings, class snapshots, microsecond cursors, exact UTC
midnight, grants, capability cleanup and runtime posture. Daily-rollup
bootstrap/maintenance tests are retained in the separate rollup branch.

Historical staging API `2a5ab6f512a05bf28afce38ac4259dea861d3669` is also
tested before/after this migration against the **complete** current catalog,
with both old and current provisioners. Its pre-existing readiness blockers
from main's Claude pool tables (0598), selected-key table (0600) and Slack
rate-limit DML (0597) remain identical; 0604 adds no violations. The old
provisioner removes newer required grants, so current-role provisioning must
be restored at cutover. This is not a claim that the serving old binary is
ready on the combined main schema. The f893cb5 modules (independently verified
equivalent to serving e61's runtime-posture/role-relationships/provisioner blobs)
are also compared before/after with both provisioners, preserving any main-0603
service-account inventory blockers. Frozen pre-0604 (a15e7a5) and current
runtime/provisioner readiness pass without exclusions or widened grants.

After the synthetic full-HTTP baseline exceeded two seconds, 0605 adds only a
concurrent partial debit-period index on account/occurredAt/workspace; no source
rows, prices, allowances, permissions or policies are changed. The pre-index
workspace seven-day p95 was 3.59s, workspace 30-day 9.80s, organization seven-day
6.62s, and organization 30-day hit the existing 10s statement timeout. These are
synthetic volume-sized local PostgreSQL 17.11 results, not PostgreSQL 16.15 staging
clearance. The indexed 5239f006 run measured workspace seven-day warm p95 4.09s,
organization seven-day 8.41s, and both 30-day cases encountered the 10s timeout
(workspace's first request succeeded). Cache-hit smoke is separate from this
uncached performance evidence; this is not a sub-two-second uncached claim.
