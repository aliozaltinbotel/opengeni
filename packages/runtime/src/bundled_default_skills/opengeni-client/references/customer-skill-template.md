# Customer OpenGeni integration

Replace every bracketed placeholder with a non-secret project fact. Keep this
Skill beside the product's integration code and review it whenever the installed
`@opengeni/sdk` major version changes.

## Stable configuration

- OpenGeni base URL: `[non-secret HTTPS base URL]`
- Organization ID: `[non-secret UUID]`
- External source convention: `[stable product namespace, for example acme-support]`
- Workspace isolation unit: `[tenant | end user | chat | another explicit sharing group]`
- Credential environment variables: `OPENGENI_API_KEY`, `OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL` (always pass `baseUrl`)
- Base URL environment variable: `OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL`
- Organization environment variable: `OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_ID`

Never put API keys, delegated signing secrets, provider tokens, production
responses, or user identifiers in this Skill. Read credentials from the
server-side secret manager or environment at runtime.

## Chosen integration shape

This product uses `[organization API key | workspace API key | delegated token]`
because `[one sentence explaining the authority boundary]`.

- Server-side adapter/proxy: `[path]`
- Tenant-to-workspace mapping persistence: `[path or table/model name]`
- Session/event proxy: `[path]`
- Product Skill store/loader: `[path]`
- Runtime profile version/source: `[version and path]`
- Explicit first-party tool allowlist: `[source of truth]`
- External Integration/MCP server selection: `[source of truth]`

If the selected shape is an organization API key, map the smallest product
group allowed to share workspace-scoped agent authority to one OpenGeni
organization workspace with `ensureWorkspace`. The wire kind is `"shared"`.
Use per-tenant mapping for collaborative chats, per-user mapping for cross-user
privacy, and per-chat mapping for hard same-user chat isolation. Personal
workspaces are excluded and must never be used as a default fallback. Persist
the returned opaque workspace ID and pass the exact product-selected Skills
inline in `CreateSessionRequest.skills` for every product-created session;
there is no organization-wide Skill inheritance. Turning Knowledge authoring off
does not isolate sessions.
Each submitted Skill contains `files` with a valid `SKILL.md`. Its YAML
frontmatter owns the name and description used in the agent's initial index;
do not keep a second editable summary in the product adapter. Submit files
alone; optional legacy name/description values must exactly match frontmatter.
Use a key issued by the organization API-key control plane. Do not reuse an
ambiguous legacy null-workspace token; provenance migrations revoke those keys
so old and new API instances both fail closed during rollout.

If the selected shape is a workspace API key, configure one pre-provisioned
workspace ID and never call `ensureWorkspace` or an organization API-key route.
The credential is valid only for that exact workspace. If the selected shape is
a delegated token, use only the account/workspace and permissions frozen into
the host-issued token; do not substitute organization-key behavior.

## Required workflow

1. Authenticate the product user and resolve the allowed product tenant.
2. Load the server-held credential; never return it to the browser.
3. For an organization key, resolve or ensure the tenant's workspace with the
   stable external source/id pair. For a workspace key, load and verify the
   configured pre-provisioned workspace ID instead.
4. Apply explicit workspace settings through installed SDK methods.
5. Create sessions with a stable idempotency key and product-owned inline
   Skills, plus explicit minimal `tools` and `firstPartyMcpTools` selections.
6. Reject caller-supplied workspace/session IDs that do not match the product's
   persisted tenant relationship.
7. Proxy event streaming with replay-by-sequence and duplicate suppression.
8. Reconcile settings, Connections, API Integrations, and runtime profile only
   when their desired version changes; do not repeat control-plane installation
   on every chat request.

## Smoke probes

Run through the product's authenticated server-side test harness; do not paste
credentials into shell history or this file.

```text
GET /v1/config/client
GET /v1/access/me
GET /v1/workspaces
```

Verify that the live deployment and installed SDK types agree. They outrank
remembered route, model, provider, tool, or compute lists. For an organization
key, an empty `workspaceGrants` array in `/v1/access/me` is expected;
`GET /v1/workspaces` is the complete organization-workspace inventory.
