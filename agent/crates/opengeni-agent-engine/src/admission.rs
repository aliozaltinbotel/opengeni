//! Job admission: fair start-ordering + derived circuit breakers. NOT a
//! throughput governor.
//!
//! Doctrine (LIMITS-DOCTRINE.md, supersedes the earlier fixed-cap design):
//! the runner holds **no concurrency policy**. It admits everything it is
//! asked to run; the swarm/server owns pacing, informed by the capacity
//! telemetry the runner reports upward ([`AdmissionState::snapshot`] feeds
//! the heartbeat). Physical protection is the kernel's job (per-op cgroup
//! leaves, OOM scoring) — counting ops was always a proxy, and proxies don't
//! ship as policy. What remains here:
//!
//! * **Liveness never enters admission** — ping/hello are answered inline by
//!   the transport layer and are invisible here.
//! * Two classes, **Light** (stat/list/mkdir/move/remove/pty-control) and
//!   **Heavy** (exec, large fs transfers, git), kept for *telemetry shape and
//!   fairness domains*, not for caps.
//! * **Per-origin fairness as start ordering**: when anything IS waiting
//!   (breaker saturation only), queued jobs promote round-robin across origin
//!   ids (workspace+session), so one chatty session cannot starve the rest.
//!   Ordering, never denial.
//! * **Circuit breakers, not caps**: `max_running`/`max_queued` default to
//!   `None` (unbounded) and, when set via [`AdmissionConfig::derive`], come
//!   from measured host headroom (fds, pids) at orders of magnitude above
//!   sane load. A breaker trip is LOUD (typed refusal naming the breaker) and
//!   means a pathology (fork-bomb-shaped bug), never legitimate load shaping.
//! * **No queue-wait deadline by default**: a queued job waits until its
//!   caller cancels — patience belongs to the caller (C in the taxonomy).
//!   `queue_wait_max_ms` exists as an optional breaker for tests/constrained
//!   deployments only.
//! * **No pressure-based refusal**: host pressure (PSI, memory headroom) is
//!   REPORTED upward in heartbeats and acted on by the server, which can
//!   pace, shed, or restart the machine — the brain is in the cloud and the
//!   state of record is server-side.
//!
//! Everything is pure and clock-injected: the integration layer owns timers
//! (it calls [`AdmissionState::expire`] on a tick — a no-op under default
//! config) and samples [`crate::HostCapacity`] for `derive`.
