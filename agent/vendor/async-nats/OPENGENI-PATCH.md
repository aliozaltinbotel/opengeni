# Retained publication receipts

This is the published `async-nats` 0.46.0 crate, from upstream revision
`49d9e80bd8bc14aa4505599fd6e7e8f6b493ee53` (`async-nats` directory).
The original crate archive SHA256 is
`df5af9ebfb0a14481d3eaf6101e6391261e4f30d25b26a7635ade8a39482ded0`.
Its source copyright headers remain intact. `LICENSE` contains the Apache 2.0
license from that exact upstream revision. The declared Rust 1.79 requirement
remains compatible with the agent workspace's Rust 1.82 minimum.

The upstream generated `cargotree` and `lcov.info` diagnostics are omitted.
Neither is a source or test input. Random digest fixtures remain byte-identical
so their upstream object-store integrity expectations are preserved.

The local changes are confined to three source files and synthetic tests:

- `connection.rs` treats every nonempty internal write buffer as pending work,
  including a first write that returns `Pending` before any bytes are accepted.
- `client.rs` adds `publish_with_flush`, preserving ordinary subject and payload
  validation. Its command carries the publication and settlement receipt together.
- `lib.rs` attaches the receipt when that command enters its actual connection.
  Success requires empty internal buffers and a successful flush on that stream.
  Leaving the connection processor fails attached receipts before reconnecting,
  including cancellation, panic and closure. A replacement socket cannot redeem
  an old receipt. Commands not yet handled have not been dispatched and retain
  the client's ordinary queue behavior.
- `flush_custody_tests.rs` exercises the actual handler and client with paused
  sequential and vectored streams, cancellation, validation, and a real TCP
  replacement connection after a partial write.

This confirms transport settlement, not server processing or consumer storage.
Receipt failure remains an unknown publication outcome; it does not authorize
replaying the publication. Ordinary queued publication stays unchanged.

The package is excluded from the workspace's member set. Native CI runs its
focused library tests explicitly; unrelated upstream server integration tests
are not part of the agent suite. Remove this vendored copy when an upstream
release compatible with the supported Rust minimum provides these guarantees.
