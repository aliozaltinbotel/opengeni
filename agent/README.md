# `opengeni-agent` — the Connected Machine agent (Rust workspace)

The Rust agent that turns a user's own machine into a **Connected Machine** — a
first-class, co-equal PRIMARY OpenGeni compute target (the `selfhosted` backend,
internally). This is a standalone Cargo workspace — it is **not** part of the bun
monorepo (the bun workspaces glob excludes it, and Cargo build output is gitignored).

**How the control plane treats a Connected Machine** (canonical:
[`../docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md) §3.8 and [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)):
a machine-targeted turn runs on this agent **directly** — the control plane
establishes the session on the machine and does **not** create, lease, or bill a
cloud box for it. It ships no durable OpenGeni credential or platform Git setup,
so this agent authenticates Git with the machine's **own** credentials. The sole
transient exception is a renewable exact-attempt Codemode bearer placed only in
each authorized child exec; this binary exposes `codemode list|call|doctor` there and
never persists the bearer. The session runs
under a **per-session working directory** (the control plane's `sessions.working_dir`,
threaded to the agent as `workingDir`); the agent's reported `workspace_root` is the
default base. Exact `~` / `~/...` paths resolve against the service user's home;
ordinary relative and absolute paths retain their usual meaning. The control plane
never `git clone`s a repo onto the machine.

## Crates

| Crate                     | Role                                                                                                                         |
|---|---|
| `opengeni-agent-proto`    | Generated wire-protocol types (Rust side of the codegen).                                                                    |
| `opengeni-agent`          | The binary: `run`/`connect`/`connections`/`disconnect`/`service`/`update`/`uninstall`, plus the exact-attempt `codemode list | show | call` client; multi-deployment dial, RPC dispatch, supervisor. |
| `opengeni-agent-platform` | Per-OS `Platform` + the `service` (systemd/launchd/SCM) renderer.                                                            |
| `opengeni-agent-files-ffi` | Safe descriptor-based macOS ACL inspection for transactional writes; no desktop dependencies. |
| `opengeni-agent-stream`   | Relay-edge stream transport + pty/framebuffer pumps.                                                                         |
| `opengeni-agent-update`   | Self-update: signed-manifest discovery, minisign+sha256 verify, atomic replace, rollback.                                    |
| `opengeni-relay`          | The stateless stream-relay edge image.                                                                                       |

## Offline document IDs

`opengeni-agent codemode document-id <kind> <namespace>` prints one JSON object
with an `id` matching `openGeni.artifacts.ids.document`. It needs no Codemode
bearer, SDK installation, enrollment, or network connection. Supported kinds are
`paragraph`, `table`, `page-break`, `section`, `header`, `footer`, `comment`, and
`tracked-change`.

Copy the exact decimal `idNamespace` string from the document's inspected
`summary`; do not convert it through a JavaScript number or invent a namespace.
For example, with that value in `DOCUMENT_NAMESPACE`:

```sh
opengeni-agent codemode document-id paragraph "$DOCUMENT_NAMESPACE"
```

This only generates a new object name. Existing objects keep their inspected IDs;
direct artifact edits still require the inspected `headSequence` and `stateHash`.
It does not inspect, edit, or authorize access to a document.

## Distribution + self-update (M11)

The agent reaches a user's machine via one trusted line and keeps itself current.

Managed Linux units use `KillMode=mixed`: SIGTERM reaches only the supervisor,
which sends browserd its cooperative SIGINT. Scoped sidecars drain concurrently
with a 60-second grace, covering browserd's 30-second close and exact owned-process
cleanup; systemd retains a 90-second outer stop bound and final cgroup containment.
Only byte-identical previously generated units migrate automatically; custom
units and drop-ins remain operator-owned. These bounds do not preserve unsaved
pages or guarantee graceful completion for a permanently stuck controller.

- **Install scripts** — [`install/install.sh`](install/install.sh) (strict POSIX
  `sh`, Linux + macOS) and [`install/install.ps1`](install/install.ps1) (Windows).
  Each detects os/arch, resolves the matching GitHub-Release asset, downloads it,
  **verifies it two ways** — a minisign signature against a public key **pinned in
  the script body** + a sha256 — then installs to a per-user path, connects the
  requested workspace, and leaves the ordinary background service running. It
  contains **no secrets**. Read it before
  piping. `OPENGENI_INSTALL_BASE_URL` overrides the asset base (e.g. a local mock
  dir or the direct GitHub-Releases URL). A script served by a deployment also
  defaults `OPENGENI_API_URL` to that deployment's public origin; the committed
  managed-cloud fallback is `https://app.opengeni.ai`.
  [`install/uninstall.sh`](install/uninstall.sh)
  removes it (`--purge` also deletes credentials + deactivates the enrollment).
- **Signing key** — the minisign **public** key is committed at
  [`install/opengeni-agent-minisign.pub`](install/opengeni-agent-minisign.pub) and
  embedded in both install scripts + `opengeni-agent-update` (one key, one verify
  routine for install AND self-update). The **private** key is the GitHub Actions
  secret `OPENGENI_AGENT_MINISIGN_KEY` — never in the repo.
- **Self-update** — `opengeni-agent update [--check]` discovers signed manifests
  from the enrolled deployments, verifies minisign + sha256 + version monotonicity,
  selects the highest valid release, atomically self-replaces, reconciles any
  required generated background-service definition, executes the updated
  installation as a health gate, and automatically rolls back on failure. A
  tampered or non-booting artifact is always rejected. Capabilities that depend on
  service topology remain unadvertised until that reconciliation succeeds.
- **Managed update drain** — routed work reserves its place before task spawning,
  so an unpolled RPC cannot escape the idle check. An unfinished transactional
  upload defers the update with retryable `update_busy_uploads`; its exact
  connection, operation, and epoch may continue or cancel. Uploads retain their
  existing reconnect behavior and have no invented expiry. Completion, failure,
  cancellation, or removal of the owning link releases the upload reservation.
- **Background service** — `opengeni-agent start|stop|status` is the normal simple
  lifecycle; `service install|uninstall|...` is the advanced surface. It uses a
  systemd user/system unit, macOS LaunchAgent, or Windows Service. Repeated `start`
  repairs the definition without disrupting a running same-version process;
  `start --restart` activates a real binary upgrade once. The generated service
  preserves the installer's command `PATH`; agent commands retain that normal
  machine environment, while the lifecycle CLI resolves the operating system's
  real systemd tools ahead of unrelated user shims. `service install --print` is the dry run.
  `opengeni-agent run` remains the explicit foreground mode.
- **Pipelines** — `.github/workflows/agent-ci.yml` (fmt/clippy/test/build +
  install-smoke across ubuntu/macOS/Windows per PR) and `.github/workflows/agent-release.yml`
  (matrix build → minisign-sign + sha256 → GitHub Release; macOS notarize + Windows
  Authenticode are guarded creds-drop-ins that skip cleanly when absent).

## One agent, many OpenGeni deployments

Install the binary once, then run the one-liner from every workspace you want
this machine to serve. `opengeni-agent connect` adds or refreshes only that exact
deployment/workspace pair; it never replaces other credentials. A running agent
reconciles the connection directory live within a few seconds.

```sh
opengeni-agent connections
opengeni-agent disconnect <connection-id-or-prefix>
```

Credentials live as independent owner-only documents under
`$OPENGENI_CONFIG_DIR/connections/` (or the platform config default). The local
identity is derived from **API origin + workspace id**, so unrelated deployments
may safely contain the same workspace UUID. Each link owns its NATS bearer, relay
token, epoch, reconnect loop, and stream registrar. Links share one host-capacity
sampler, one operation engine/spool ledger, and the OS containment manager.
Operation ids and admission origins are locally namespaced by connection, so one
deployment cannot cancel, query, acknowledge, detach, or collide with another's
work. Removing one connection sends its own going-offline event and leaves every
other link and command running.

The control plane deliberately rotates each connection's short-lived NATS user
JWT. That expected expiry reconnects immediately with the durable enrollment
bearer; established op-stream commands detach, keep running, and replay any
missed output after re-attachment. Full-jitter backoff is reserved for actual
transport failures.

On Linux each accepted host operation gets a separate cgroup-v2 memory/lifecycle
leaf while the generated systemd fragment requests an unlimited aggregate. Admin
drop-ins and ancestor constraints remain authoritative. The
generated unit uses systemd's `DelegateSubgroup=supervisor`, so the first and every
replacement control process starts in the same supervisor leaf while the delegated
root remains empty and restart-safe. Startup verifies this topology and stamps that
leaf with systemd-oomd's avoid marker. A custom/older unit that cannot provide the
subgroup is reported as incapable and stays on unrestricted ambient execution;
an explicit resource policy then fails closed. Optional per-enrollment memory and
exact integer-millicore CPU limits arrive on each newly admitted exec/Git request;
an in-flight command keeps its admitted snapshot. Limits compose with stricter local
`OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_MEMORY_{MAX,HIGH}` / `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_CPU_MAX_MILLICORES`
or ancestor policy. Memory and CPU enforcement are separately advertised. Startup
enables memory only; CPU is leased only while a CPU-limited leaf exists, and I/O and
PID controllers remain untouched. The default remains the machine's ambient
resources, and typed PTY/desktop/browser/computer operations are unchanged.

An installation upgraded from the old single-connection file keeps that link
online immediately. Because the old file did not record its deployment URL,
`connections` labels the migrated origin unverified; running the exact
deployment's connect command once confirms the origin and replaces only that
legacy record. An unverified URL hint is never used as an update source; the
signed public channel (or an explicit `update --base-url …`) remains the safe
fallback until reconnect confirms it. Self-update is installation-wide (including
the background-service definition when a release requires it): matching
per-connection channels are used automatically, while mixed `stable`/`beta` links
require an explicit `opengeni-agent update --channel …` choice instead of silently
picking one.

If the control plane rejects a saved enrollment bearer, refresh only that exact
deployment/workspace connection with the force flag shown in the agent log:

```sh
opengeni-agent connect --force --api-url https://<deployment> --workspace-id <workspace-uuid>
```

## Wire protocol — single source of truth

For native large-file editor writes, see [transactional uploads](TRANSACTIONAL-WRITES.md):
the independent capability gate, exact upload lifecycle, supported Linux file
semantics, and restart/lost-ack restrictions. `op_stream` alone does not imply
transactional filesystem support.

The protocol is defined **once** in [`proto/opengeni_agent.proto`](proto/opengeni_agent.proto)
(proto3, package `opengeni.agent.v1`) and code-generated to **both** stacks so the
control plane (TypeScript) and the agent (Rust) can never drift:

- **Rust:** `opengeni-agent-proto`'s `build.rs` compiles the proto via
  [`prost`] + [`protox`] (a pure-Rust protobuf compiler — **no `protoc` binary
  needed**, so `cargo build` is hermetic, incl. on NixOS). Generated types live in
  `opengeni_agent_proto::v1`.
- **TypeScript:** [`ts-proto`] generates `packages/agent-proto/src/gen/`, shipped
  as the `@opengeni/agent-proto` package and consumed by the control plane.

### Regenerate everything (one command)

```sh
agent/scripts/codegen.sh        # regenerates BOTH Rust and TS from the proto
```

`protoc` for the TS side is resolved from `nixpkgs#protobuf` automatically (or set
`PROTOC` / put `protoc` on `PATH`). The Rust side regenerates on any `cargo build`.

### Round-trip test (the "no drift" proof)

```sh
agent/scripts/roundtrip.sh      # Rust-encode -> TS-decode AND TS-encode -> Rust-decode
```

Both stacks encode an identical canonical corpus; each decodes the other's bytes
and asserts field-equality, and for map-free messages asserts **byte-for-byte**
wire equality. A green run proves the two generated stacks agree. The fixtures
(`tests/fixtures/{rust,ts}_encoded.txt`) are committed so `cargo test` and
`bun test packages/agent-proto/test/roundtrip.test.ts` each pass standalone.

The optional slow-close acceptance fixture uses only synthetic profiles and a
locally installed `chromium`. In an isolated Linux test environment, from `agent/`:

```sh
OPENGENI_TEST_SLOW_BROWSERD="$PWD/tests/fixtures/slow-browserd-chromium.sh" \
  cargo test -p opengeni-agent shutdown_waits_for_slow_owned_cleanup_across_scopes_concurrently
```

It delays each of two sidecars' cleanup by 12 seconds, closes its own Chromium
child, and reopens the same profile before confirming completion. This exercises
native manager timing with real browsers; it is not a full browserd or live
systemd integration test.
