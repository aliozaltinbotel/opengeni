/**
 * Seed a LOCAL managed-mode dev stack with fake data for UI design previews.
 *
 *   bun scripts/dev-seed-design-preview.ts --yes [--credentials <file>]
 *
 * Safety:
 * - Runs only against this worktree's own `bun run dev` stack: the API URL comes
 *   from `.env.runtime` (OPENGENI_API_PORT), must be loopback, and the API must
 *   report `productAccessMode: managed`. `--api` may only name that same URL.
 * - Requires an explicit `--yes`.
 * - Uses the public API and Better Auth endpoints. Direct SQL (through the
 *   worktree's loopback migrations DSN) is used only where no API exists:
 *   expired API keys; finished conversation history (real-shaped tool calls,
 *   approvals, questions, sub-agents, goals; see dev-seed-design-preview/);
 *   file publications; schedule run history; Knowledge proposals awaiting
 *   review; and Insights usage facts.
 * - Never sends a model turn: session shells are created empty in realtime
 *   start mode and the SQL history creates no workflow wakes or outbox rows.
 *   Sessions left waiting on a person get a closed requires_action attempt,
 *   the state a real worker leaves behind. Schedules are paused, `manual`
 *   (fires only on Run now), or active in the database only while their
 *   Temporal schedule stays paused. Sending a message, answering, approving,
 *   Run now, or editing/resuming a schedule would start real turns.
 *
 * Idempotent: every object is looked up by name first and reused.
 *
 * Passwords: the owner (bendik@acme.dev) password is read from, or generated
 * into, the credentials file (mode 0600). Other fake people share a derived
 * password (generated) stored in the same file.
