# MCP surfaces — which one do you want?

Audience: integrators. Opengeni touches the Model Context Protocol in eight
places. They are different products with different owners and lifecycles; this
page exists so you pick the right one in one read.

| Surface | Who configures it | Scope / lifecycle | Credentials | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Organization MCP server** (`/v1/mcp`) | The person who connects an agent, on the sign-in page; owners and admins can disconnect any agent | One URL for everyone. Every public API action through three tools (find, describe, run), each running the real route in process as the caller | MCP OAuth sign-in acting as the person, capped by the connection's access setting; or an organization API key | An outside agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) should do what a person can do across an organization |
| **Unified workspace tool MCP** (`/v1/workspaces/:id/mcp`) | Workspace enables integrations; session policy may narrow agent attempts | Current-human requests expose the enabled first-party, Files, Docs, capability, API-integration, and Codex Apps tools through one canonical gateway; `OPENGENI_ALLOWED_FIRST_PARTY_MCP_TOOLS` remains a hard ceiling on the broad `opengeni` server across catalog, execution, and OAuth consent, without narrowing Docs or Files. Entries requiring one-shot human approval stay in the canonical catalog but are omitted from this adapter until MCP has a server-verifiable approval transport. Agent attempts retain their exact frozen selection | Existing Opengeni bearer or standard MCP OAuth `mcp:access`, always intersected with live workspace authority | An MCP client needs the callable unified tool surface without provider-specific wrappers |
| **Codemode** (`/v1/workspaces/:id/codemode`) | Opengeni worker, from the exact tools prepared for one attempt | Immutable attempt-frozen projection of every admitted model tool; approval choices apply uniformly; capable clients receive durable pending handles for review | Exact `agent_attempt` bearer: protected renewable file in managed sandboxes; in-memory, per-exec snapshot on Connected Machines. Execution stays in the owning worker and reuses the same resolved credentials/executor as model MCP | Attempt code needs typed, idempotent tool calls without a model round trip |
| **Workspace HTTP/SDK tools** (`/v1/workspaces/:id/tools/*`) | Current authenticated human | Live projection of the same unified gateway; `client.tools.forWorkspace(id)` provides catalog, direct typed calls, and declarations. Connection-backed entries that also require one-shot human approval are omitted until their provider adapter supplies side-effect-free credential/resource preflight | Current human's ordinary authenticated browser/API request | A browser or host application needs typed tools without speaking MCP |
| **Site tool bridge** (`@opengeni/sdk/site`) | Immutable Site version requests exact identities; the current viewer remains authoritative | Parent-filtered projection over the live workspace HTTP/SDK gateway, carried on one document-retained iframe bootstrap `MessagePort`. Requested identities are only a maximum allowlist; publishing grants no authority. Top-level sandbox previews use the same client through a same-origin Codemode adapter | No credential enters Site code; the published parent uses its current session and the local Bun host retains the attempt bearer | Publisher-controlled Site code needs typed tools in either the published renderer or sandbox preview |
| **Docs MCP** (`/mcp/docs`) | Nobody — built in | Dedicated compatibility endpoint; the same Docs implementation is also included in the unified gateway | Caller's bearer | A narrowly configured client needs only workspace document search |
| **Files MCP** (`/mcp/files`) | Nobody — built in | Dedicated compatibility endpoint; the same Files implementation is also included in the unified gateway | Caller's bearer with `files:read` | A narrowly configured client needs only file materialization |
| **Capability MCP servers** | Workspace admin (capabilities settings) | Workspace-wide; on for every session while enabled | Workspace-owned OAuth or admin-supplied headers, authenticated-encrypted at rest; ordinary projections are metadata-only. Dedicated permissioned plaintext reads are an approved release-held follow-up. Gmail and hosted Slack MCP support personal or workspace ownership; personal use follows the immutable initiating user | A third-party tool (e.g. a SaaS MCP) should be available to *all* sessions and schedules in a workspace |
| **Per-session MCP servers** (`mcpServers` on session create) | The embedding host, per session | One session; static headers rotatable on every user turn; host connection refs resolved per request | Authenticated-encrypted headers with metadata-only ordinary projections, or a non-secret opaque `connectionRef` resolved by the standalone/host broker. Dedicated plaintext reads are an approved release-held follow-up | An embedding host injects its own tool server or binds an existing provider connection without duplicating it |
| **Codex Apps MCP** | Deployment enables the feature; a scoped human explicitly designates one workspace credential; session policy selects it | Available only while that exact designation remains authorized; workspace-default sessions receive it as optional, while explicit/fixed sessions see it only when selected | Only the designated Apps credential, independent of inference | A compatible model should use connected ChatGPT apps without tying their authority to inference routing or silently widening an exact tool allowlist |

### Workspace Streamable HTTP

For new remote API-key or bearer MCPs, the agent can prepare the native
[connection configuration](remote-mcp-credentials.md#agent-prepared-api-key-connections).
An authorized agent with the credential uses the protected Connect request path;
otherwise the chat card asks the person only for the missing key. Neither path
widens the accepted attempt's tool selection or bypasses existing permissions.

The unified `/v1/workspaces/:id/mcp` endpoint uses a fresh stateless
JSON-response transport per POST. It does not offer a server-to-client SSE
stream: authorized GET requests return `405 Method Not Allowed` with
`Allow: POST`, without preparing tools. OAuth, workspace and bound-session
authorization still run first; unsupported protocol-version headers return 400.
POST initialization, notifications, tool calls and client-abort handling are
unchanged. No MCP session ID is issued or required by this stateless endpoint.

Unexpected API 5xx responses emit a content-free error log with the method,
route pattern and response correlation ID. Thrown failures also retain a closed
cause kind and diagnostic ID; the existing opt-in protected diagnostics sink
receives bounded cause locations, never exception messages, request bodies or
credentials.

### Organization MCP server

Connect any MCP client to `<public origin>/v1/mcp`. Sign-in opens the web
app's `/connect-agent` page, where the person picks the organization, what the
agent can do (Full access, Read only without secret values, or Custom
permissions) and where (all workspaces including new ones and their Personal
workspace, or selected ones). The connection then acts as that person:

- Every call re-resolves the person's live access and caps it by the
  connection's access setting. Losing access or a narrower setting applies to
  the next call; disconnecting refuses every token at once.
- `opengeni_actions_search`, `opengeni_action_describe` and
  `opengeni_action_call` cover every route the API registers, named from
  `scripts/public-api/surface.gen.json` where the SDK has a method
  (`scripts/public-api/action-catalog.ts`; a test fails when a registered route
  is neither in the catalog nor exempt). Exempt, each with its reason in that
  file: Opengeni sign-in, sign-in methods and account recovery, approving an
  agent sign-in and managing connected agents (an agent can never approve or
  widen its own access), provider redirects back to Opengeni, signed calls
  from other services, git protocol, machine enrollment, browser telemetry and
  static files.
- A call runs the route in process with a request-local proof of the person
  (`stampDelegatedHumanAuthorization` in `@opengeni/core`). Nothing a client
  sends can create it, and the route's own permission checks decide.
- Organization routes that otherwise read the person's browser cookie accept
  the proof too (`apps/api/src/http/acting-person.ts`): only in the
  connection's organization (another one reads as not found), only with the
  permission the route needs in the connection's access setting
  (`account:read` to read settings, `account:admin` to change them,
  `members:manage` for people and invitations), and the database still checks
  the person's own role. Same-origin checks don't apply: no browser credentials
  ride along.
- Read only connections are refused any change before it runs. Requests that
  only read but are sent as POST (knowledge and document search, reading a
  session file, a git diff, previews; `READ_ONLY_POST_ACTIONS` in
  `apps/api/src/organization-mcp.ts`) still run.
- The access setting is literal, like an explicit organization key: in Custom,
  `workspace:admin` is one permission, never a wildcard for the ones left out.
  The person's own role still expands as usual, so Full access reaches
  everything the person can do.
- Third-party provider sign-in (Codex, SuperGrok and Claude device or OAuth
  steps, and integration OAuth starts) stays with the person in the browser;
  calls return a hint to finish there. Actions no MCP caller can ever complete
  because they need the person's own browser session (creating an
  organization, listing their organization memberships and invitations,
  accepting an invitation, organization recovery, and confirming an identity
  link) are marked `browserOnly` in the catalog (`ACTION_CATALOG_BROWSER_ONLY`
  in `scripts/public-api/action-catalog.ts`): search never returns them, and
  describe or call answers with the reason without running anything.
  Organization API keys may call the same server and act as the organization.
- `initialize` advertises `serverInfo` title `Opengeni` and the brand mark as
  MCP `icons` (light and dark SVG data URIs, plus `/icon-512.png` on the public
  origin when `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set) for clients that render them.

Connected agents are listed, changed and disconnected at
`/v1/organizations/:id/mcp-connections` (browser only; SDK
`listOrganizationMcpConnections`, `updateOrganizationMcpConnection`,
`deleteOrganizationMcpConnection`). Migration `0601` is rolling.

The public OAuth authorization server is deliberately narrow: public dynamic
client registration, authorization-code grant with mandatory PKCE S256, exact
RFC 8707 resource binding to one workspace MCP/Docs/Files resource, scope
`mcp:access`, opaque 15-minute access tokens, and rotating 30-day refresh
tokens. Consent requires the existing managed or local current-human session. OAuth
tokens are accepted only by MCP routes and never become REST credentials.
OAuth consent grants MCP access; it does not silently satisfy a tool's separate
one-shot human-approval classification. HTTP/SDK approval capabilities bind a
private provider-authority revision as well as the public catalog identity and
arguments. Their connection preflight never refreshes credentials or records
provider usage, and an approval-required connection-backed adapter without that
seam is omitted until it can fail before capability issuance. An unconsumed
capability may be replaced when catalog or provider authority changes, but a
consumed capability leaves a durable hash-only operation tombstone: the same
operation id cannot be approved again after execution may have started.

First-party project tools use existing session permissions: `project_list/get` require `sessions:read`; `project_create/update/reorder/delete` require `sessions:create`; `session_set_project` requires `sessions:control` and target-session authorization. Projects, pins and order are workspace-shared. Deletion unfiles sessions without stopping or deleting them. `sessions_list(projectId)` filters membership; `session_create(projectId)` files new work. The short [project skill](../packages/runtime/src/bundled_project_skills/opengeni-projects/SKILL.md) explains the sidebar model. No new ownership model or database migration is needed.

For lossless scheduled-task model edits, use
`scheduled_tasks_update({ id, agentConfigPatch: { model, reasoningEffort } })`.
The read tool's bounded projection is not full replacement input. Existing
sessions keep their own model; see [scheduled-task update semantics](scheduled-task-access.md).

For an **existing session**, use
`session_set_model({ sessionId, model, reasoningEffort, idempotencyKey })`.
Both model and reasoning are explicit; latency and all unrelated settings stay
unchanged. The tool uses `sessions:control`, the caller's exact tool selection,
live-attempt fencing, private-session ownership and the host's
`session.model.write` decision. It adds no permission or approval layer.
The response identifies the durable receipt and effective defaults; reuse the
same key and input after an uncertain response. `session_get({ sessionId,
detail: "full" })` returns canonical `model`, `reasoningEffort` and `latencyMode`.
An agent retry remains bound to the same calling session and target across
attempt replacement, while the current attempt must independently remain
authorized. Replaying an old receipt does not overwrite a newer setting.

`session_create` inherits omitted model and reasoning from the exact calling
turn, but omitted `latencyMode` always starts a fresh session in `standard`.
Explicit `fast` or `priority` is honored only when the selected model supports
it. Sending another agent a message does not change that recipient's latency
default; keyed creation replay returns the original accepted settings.

This is a future-default change, not a prompt or a resume. Already accepted work
keeps its frozen policy. Older queued turns cannot undo the choice when they
start, and scheduled per-occurrence model overrides do not replace these explicit
session defaults. A subsequent human/API turn accepted after the setting can
establish a new inherited choice when it starts. Ordering uses its original
`turn.queued` admission, not a mutable approval/recovery trigger; an older turn
never becomes a fresh model selection. New schedules targeting the
session capture the effective defaults at occurrence admission; editing the
session does not edit the task's own configuration. No Codemode SDK proxy path
is widened, and already-running attempts do not gain a newly released tool.

Release the API, core/database/contracts and workers as one matched source cohort
before using this operation. There is no schema migration, but an older worker
does not honor the new defaults boundary. A source merge or SDK update alone
does not establish deployment or behavioral verification.

### Human integration setup in chat

The shared operational guidance tells the agent to use available integration
tools directly. When needed access is missing, it routes discovery through
`capability_catalog_search`.
Every candidate requiring authorization includes `setup.nextAction` naming
`capability_authorization_request` and the exact catalog capability ID. Ready or
unavailable candidates return no setup action. Search itself is read-only.

For a suitable candidate, the agent requests the card with that ID and a
task-specific rationale. Showing the card requires no preliminary confirmation;
the card itself presents the setup decision. The same exact-attempt-fenced `tool.auth_needed`
event and generic chat renderer handle all catalog integrations. Requesting the
card requires no integration-management permission and creates no connection,
installation, credential, or grant; the authenticated human completes setup.
Provider-specific status tools remain read-only and do not synthesize cards.

### Recovery from tool-search misses

Progressive discovery uses the same authorized deferred pool on Codex-native,
OpenAI-native, and generic-dispatch transports. Keyword search is ranked, not
exhaustive. Tools whose exact name (with an underscore) appears in the query
come first, before the keyword ranking, and the result grows to include all of
them. Past search results are stored as they were returned and never re-run,
so this ordering changes new searches only, not any cached prompt. `tool_list` is a query-independent fallback: it returns compact
names and description previews, with a default page of 20, a maximum of 40,
and a 16 KiB response budget. Follow `nextCursor` until null, preserving the
optional literal `namePrefix` filter. An invalid cursor requires restarting
the listing against the current pool. Names and prefixes are display/routing
keys, never authorization identities.

Use `tool_search` with `query: ""` and `names: ["exact_name"]` to disclose the
listed tool's full schema without keyword ranking. Exact lookup cannot admit
a tool outside the current pool. Search backfills smaller candidates after
schema-size exclusions while retaining existing count and byte limits.
Native disclosure returns the original SDK tool objects; generic dispatch,
approvals, and invocation continue through the existing runtime. Listing
joins deferred preparation but adds no preparation barrier to the first model
request, no shell dependency, and no change to eager/search policy defaults.

### Tool argument errors

First-party structured inputs reuse the native contract schemas, including
nested fields, discriminators, enums, and required properties. The MCP
registration check rejects opaque named inputs and array elements; arbitrary
metadata dictionaries remain supported. `apps/api/src/mcp/contract-input.ts`
publishes a model-safe projection and validates the full contract without
inserting defaults, trimming text, or erasing omitted fields before the
application applies inheritance. Host-only controls stay outside that
projection, including schedule Slack delivery and Agent learning settings.

Every adapter validates arguments against the tool's advertised input schema in
the shared gateway, including properties a provider lists as required but does
not itself enforce. A rejected call never reaches the provider. The error names
each missing, mistyped, or unexpected property (up to eight, then a count of the
rest) and never quotes argument values:

- Model MCP calls receive an `isError` tool result that says the tool was not
  called, lists those properties, and asks the model to correct them and call
  again. Other thrown MCP failures keep the generic retry wording.
- Workspace HTTP/SDK calls and approvals return `422 validation_failed` with the
  same summary as `message` and `details: { code: "invalid_tool_arguments",
  issues, omittedIssueCount }`, where each issue is `{ path, keyword, message }`.
- Codemode and the unified workspace MCP surface the same error message.

Union requirements are alternatives. A schema-declared discriminator selects
the applicable branch; an unknown or missing tag reports its allowed formats.
Ambiguous unions describe alternative corrections rather than presenting every
branch's requirements as cumulative. Additional native contract refinements
retain their preflight messages so cross-field failures explain the required
relationship. Downstream provider and storage exceptions are separate failures.

Unexpected failures in `session_create`, `session_send_message`, and
`session_steer` retain a bounded `error.diagnostic` in the ordinary failed-tool
receipt. It contains cause classes, reviewed source locations or location
fingerprints, line/column, a typed PostgreSQL SQLSTATE when available, and exact
caller-attempt identity from the signed grant. It never contains raw messages,
SQL, parameters, tool arguments/results, host paths, or a request-derived target
identity. Existing authorization/refusal classifications remain unchanged.

The same diagnostic ID correlates an optional protected diagnostics export.
`diagnosticExport` is `disabled`, `queued`, or `unavailable`; `queued` is not a
delivery receipt. The self-contained diagnostic remains useful without that
sink. An observer failure never changes the original outcome or retries a
mutation. These facts identify the failing boundary, not whether an uncertain
mutation committed. Canonical implementations:
`apps/api/src/mcp/orchestration-failure-diagnostic.ts` and
`packages/observability/src/failure-diagnostic.ts`.

The native Connected Machine Codemode client sends its compiled API contract
acknowledgement for compatibility with older deployments whose Codemode routes
were protected by the product mutation fence. Current deployments scope
Codemode through the attempt protocol independently, and the TypeScript client
does not send this header. A server contract mismatch must fail explicitly;
clients must not blindly echo a newly advertised version. The native mirror is
pinned to the shared contracts by `packages/codemode/test/native-api-contract.test.ts`.

Native Codemode failures emit a JSON receipt on stderr with the operation ID,
observed state, error code, and message once an operation ID has been allocated.
Its existence may remain unconfirmed if submission and subsequent observation fail.
An unobserved state remains null, never an inferred execution failure.
`opengeni-agent codemode read <operation-id>` reads the existing journal under
the current attempt's authority without submitting or repeating the tool.
Unknown outcomes are not automatically retried. Client compatibility must be
verified on packaged artifacts; catalog authority does not certify an installed
JavaScript client, and an optional client failure grants no additional access.
The `read` command exits successfully when journal observation succeeds, even
when the returned operation failed; inspect `operation.state` before using its
result. Reads require a current authorized attempt. A later attempt of the same logical
turn can inspect the original handle; a token from the ended attempt cannot.
Calls acknowledge `durableApproval` support. Waiting returns a compact receipt
and stops polling. Human approval resumes the stored operation, so callers must
not resubmit its arguments.
On a Linux Docker build host, `bun scripts/test-codemode-image.ts <image>
<absolute-native-binary> receipts` verifies the packaged clients against an
owned loopback fixture, including credential modes and GET-only recovery. This
is release verification, not a health probe that executes customer tools.

First-party Opengeni MCP Knowledge tools:

- `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_browse`, `knowledge_get`: published retrieval by
  default; explicit `view: "needs_review"` reads unapproved proposals for reuse
  and correction. Pending content never activates Knowledge or behavior.
- `knowledge_prepare_save`: read-only collection catalog and related published/
  pending matches before deciding whether and where to save. Source evidence is
  excluded from normal published discovery; explicit `includeEvidence` searches
  and exact evidence reads preserve its availability.
- `knowledge_save`, `knowledge_archive`, `knowledge_retain_file`: exact-attempt
  writes through the shared Knowledge lifecycle. Accepted Agent learning controls
  publication: Automatic, Review first, or Off. Off leaves retrieval available.
- `instruction_policy_save`: a non-destructive edit over the native instruction
  revision lifecycle, under its own accepted Agent learning category. Read the
  current baseline first; append new rules by default, use one exact anchored
  localized edit for updates/removals. Agents cannot replace the complete
  instruction; whole-policy rewrites use the manual editor. Skills use their
  native folder tools.

Search published and pending entries before saving; reuse entry IDs and versions
for corrections and collections across sources. See [Knowledge](knowledge.md).
A model call to `knowledge_search` or `knowledge_prepare_save` receives a
compact copy without bookkeeping or repeated preview text, keeping every ID,
version, status, title, description and excerpt; Codemode and other callers
receive the exact result. See
[model-visible discovery results](knowledge.md#model-visible-discovery-results).
The retired Memory and reviewed-claim tools are not registered for new work.

First-party Opengeni MCP company-profile tools (separate organization policy):

- `company_profile_propose` / `company_profile_confirm` - explicit organization-identity administration for an exact agent attempt whose live turn was initiated by the organization owner. The separate owner-managed organization policy (set on Settings > Agent learning) defaults to Review first (`suggest`): Off creates nothing, Review first stages one inactive immutable identity/mission revision and returns the exact `request_human_input` payload for `confirm`, and Automatic activates the proposal immediately through the existing compare-and-swap lifecycle and returns `status=activated`. Every mode retains exact live-owner admission and immutable receipts; this policy is independent of workspace Learning mode (see [`company-profile.md`](company-profile.md)).

First-party Opengeni MCP session monitoring tools (`sessions:read`):

- `sessions_list` / `session_get` / `session_events` - compact-by-default discovery and child-management state, and conversation-first history with explicit `results`, `tools`, and `debug` views. `session_get({})` reads only the authenticated current agent session (a child reads itself); sessionless/operator callers must supply an explicit `sessionId`. Both forms retain live-attempt and target authorization. Use `detail: "full"` on list/get for the previous bounded projections (get includes `effectiveToolPolicy`). Plain compact list browse skips claim reads; `includeRelatedWork` opts in and query/subject automatically enables advisory evidence without granting access. REST/UI defaults are unchanged. See [session monitoring](session-monitoring-mcp.md) for exact fields, pagination and loss facts, and [work discovery](work-discovery.md) for matching semantics.
- `session_wait` - one blocking call (session-scoped grants only) for a short in-turn wait. It returns when a watched session has a matching durable event after the supplied cursor, the calling session has immediate pending machine input, or `maxWaitSeconds` elapses (default 45, max 50). `waitFor: "change"` observes turn lifecycle, completed agent messages, terminal background commands, blocking failures, goal facts, and session control; `waitFor: "completion"` remains the child-result join and ignores progress, goal facts, background commands, maintenance turns, and continuation segments until a result-bearing final turn or blocker. The tool subscribes to NATS before reading PostgreSQL, but `session_events` remains authority and every wake is followed by a durable read. Failed live fanout degrades to the durable pre-check plus deadline re-check. `ownPendingUpdates > 0` means input will be delivered only when the next turn is claimed. When the returned events include a direct child's complete final answer and the call is the exact live parent attempt's own model call (the worker marks it `_meta.opengeniCaller: "model"`; a Codemode call does not count), the read is recorded on the turn and the own-pending counts exclude that child's idle terminal result for it. The attempt's successful completion supersedes a still-pending such result (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and one committed after that completion arrives already consumed; a failed or interrupted attempt suppresses nothing. Do not immediately repeat a timed-out short wait without new evidence; an unchanged `session_get` snapshot between waits is not new evidence.
- `command_read` / `command_wait` - one provider-neutral, command-specific output/status path. Read immediately or wait briefly, then resume from the output cursor. A terminal read marks completion observed and suppresses its still-pending notification; a running read leaves future completion eligible. Retained output remains readable after settlement subject to explicit retention limits. Timeout never cancels the command; use `wait_for_input` for a long or uncertain wait. The separate native shell tool `command_input(session_id, chars)` sends nonempty stdin in its owning context where supported; it is not a first-party MCP endpoint and reports unsupported capabilities explicitly.
- `wait_for_input` (`sessions:control`, session-scoped grants only, self-only) - the out-of-turn long wait. It does not require a goal. The tool stores the exact declaring turn, a bounded reason, and an absolute PostgreSQL deadline derived from relative `timeoutSeconds` (30 seconds to 7 days), appends `session.wait.started`, and arms the durable workflow-wake outbox. The agent must end its turn after success. Human/API input, Agent message or Steer, an immediate child notice, a schedule, a terminal background-command result, or the deadline restarts the session. A human/API turn that neither calls `wait_for_input` again nor consumes the awaited machine input leaves the wait armed; only a newer finished turn that a person did not start or that consumed immediate machine input, or the deadline, retires it. A timeout queues typed `session_wait_timeout` machine input and never cancels background work. `goal_pause` remains the correct tool when the active goal itself must stop for a human decision.

Exact-attempt advisory work-claim mutations (`sessions:control`) use
`work_claim_upsert` and `work_claim_release`. They are CAS/idempotency-fenced,
non-exclusive, and independently removable from the model-visible catalog by
the operator without deleting durable evidence; see
[`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md).

`CreateSessionRequest.firstPartyMcpTools` is an exact allowlist over the exported
`FIRST_PARTY_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` catalog. Omission selects the safe default catalog,
which excludes connector-wide `social_*`, `slack_bot_*` and `fiken_*` tools; those require
explicit selection plus their normal connection permission. Historical native
`atlassian_*` names remain parseable but are excluded from execution; Atlassian
agent access uses its hosted MCP connector. Explicit `[]` means
no tools from the broad server. Unknown names fail validation. This field does
not grant authority: every catalog entry also has an explicit registration-time
permission predicate, and target-scoped authorization still runs on calls.
Omitting the field on a new top-level session follows the workspace's current
built-in defaults (or the deployment defaults when no workspace override exists).
`toolPolicy.firstPartyMode: "workspace_default"` records this intent independently
of connector selection. New defaults are resolved when preparing the next attempt,
under the deployment allowlist, configured capability families, and permissions.
An already prepared catalog or signed delegation does not gain tools mid-attempt.
Child omission inherits both the parent's effective selection and its default or
pinned intent; an explicit child list can only narrow that selection.

An explicit list, including `[]`, remains pinned. The existing **Reset to workspace
defaults** action opts an older session into following defaults; editing connector
exclusions alone preserves its built-in intent. Legacy sessions without that
intent remain pinned unless their latest retained tool-policy event proves a full
reset and still matches the stored selection. Migration does not infer intent from
connector mode or similarity to today's defaults. Scheduled accepted selections
remain exact snapshots; they are never re-resolved during recovery.

GitHub App installation credentials are deliberately absent from this catalog.
Repository discovery and browser connect status remain model-visible, but token
minting and credential-file renewal stay host-side in the worker/runtime. No
first-party MCP, Codemode, API, SDK, event, or audit projection returns a live
installation token to the model or sandbox command surface.

File and document resources are independent from this broad-server selection.
Attaching a resource still materializes it for the session when
`firstPartyMcpTools` is `[]` or title-only; selecting the dedicated `files` or
`docs` MCP server is a separate `tools` decision. Document search results carry
the backing `fileId`; reading an indexed chunk stays within Docs MCP, while
downloading the complete original uses Files MCP. Workspace-default policy
includes Files, but an explicit API/embedding policy may omit it.

Codex Apps follows that same separation. Enabling
`OPENGENI_CODEX_CONNECTED_APPS_ENABLED` registers `codex_apps` as a selectable
runtime MCP only for workspaces with one explicit, currently authorized Apps
credential designation; the flag alone exposes no executable tools. Omitted
session tools use the workspace default and include it as optional. Explicit and
inherited-fixed policies remain exact. A null designation means no Apps server
and there is no active-credential, pinned-credential, allocator, or static-header
fallback.

When an Apps setup attempt fails, the runtime skips Apps for that turn and logs
an Apps-specific reconnect/retry warning instead of failing the turn.
Statusless transport failures are marked retryable; provider response bodies,
URLs, headers, and credentials remain outside the public diagnostic projection.

Apps is discovered on every turn, so setup traffic (initialize and tool
listing) never publishes a `tool.auth_needed` card; otherwise a broken
designation would post a new card on every turn that selects Apps. Only a tool
call that needs Apps publishes one, at most once per prepared tool environment
(a publish that fails does not count). A designated credential that can no
longer be used (the designation was cleared or changed, the credential was
disconnected, or its owner lost the permission) is reported as
`designated_credential_unavailable`. A designated credential whose sign-in
failed (a refresh was rejected, or it is already marked for relogin) stays
`refresh_failed`, because the remedy is reconnecting that same account.

Inference and Apps authority are deliberately unrelated. The designated Apps
credential works with compatible Codex or non-Codex inference and remains usable
when every inference subscription is quota-exhausted, cooled down, allocator-
disabled, unpinned, or leased elsewhere. Loading its token and persisting its
refreshes use the designation itself as authority (this workspace's own
credential, the current designation, and its owner's current permission), never
the workspace's inference routing source, so a designation keeps working when
routing uses organization accounts or subscriptions are disabled. That authority
reaches only the designated credential, never another workspace or organization
account. A refresh it admitted still records its rotated tokens on that same row
if the designation is cleared while the provider call is in flight, so the row
never keeps a refresh token the provider has already spent. Only the current human owner of an
active connected credential may designate it, and that human must currently
hold `connections:write` (workspace-admin scope satisfies it). Any managed human
with that scope may clear the designation without owning the credential, in any
routing mode; designating still requires workspace routing. Bearer,
agent, scheduled, and service identities cannot perform either mutation. Every
Apps request rechecks the exact designation, connection status, owner membership,
and owner permission immediately before resolving/sending credentials. Reconnect
never changes a credential's owner; disconnect clears the designation and audit
event atomically. Visibility still obeys the session tool policy independently.
Codex Apps tools admitted to an attempt are projected into Codemode from the
same frozen catalog. Codemode does not proxy or reconstruct them: execution
returns to the same prepared MCP instance, so the per-request designated-owner
check and connector-wire compatibility layer remain authoritative and no static
or weaker credential copy reaches sandbox code.

### Accepted connection-use authority

Organization-user connections are selected explicitly; a session creator,
current browser user, service actor, or worker identity is never a substitute.
For activated configured MCP connections, the accepted human/API turn stores a
server-built, credential-free snapshot of the exact connection, causal human,
organization membership authorization revision, common resource authority,
grant, target session visibility/epoch, and accepted logical work. Each
physical provider request—including a safe read retry after 401—must authorize
that persisted snapshot for the exact current attempt before resolving any
credential. A `once` grant is consumed atomically when the logical turn is
accepted and is bound to that turn by its durable receipt; every physical call
and recovery attempt only validates the matching receipt, while another turn
cannot be accepted with it. Audit facts contain identifiers, generations, outcome,
and a denial reason only—never credentials, headers, arguments, content, or
provider responses.

Migration 0264 is a drained maintenance cutover because an old worker can omit
these attempt/use facts. The migration enforces the drain with live app-role
session checks around exclusive writer locks and rejects all executable
pre-activation common-user work instead of backfilling it from mutable state.
Its first bounded activation covers configured remote
MCP, API-hosted OpenAPI/GraphQL, Gmail REST, and Google Drive publication
requests; the publication adapter reauthorizes
independently before destination verification, idempotency search, and upload,
and never replays an outcome-uncertain upload. Host credential callbacks are
limited here to host MCP credential callbacks: they are invoked only after local
authorization and receive credential-free attribution. Git, sandbox, and run
credential ports are separate authorities and are not covered by migration 0264.
Activated Atlassian is omitted from direct turns, and scheduled tasks reject
activated MCP, Google Drive, and Atlassian selections, until their dedicated
acceptance/occurrence adapters land. First-party Atlassian, Fiken, Slack,
social, and scheduled knowledge-source surfaces remain explicit successors;
workspace and `legacy_user` connections remain on their bounded compatibility
path rather than being silently upgraded.

An activated personal connection freezes its physical origin separately from
the target workspace. Exact common authority permits same-organization use and
the lifecycle-derived owner-only personal workspace even though that personal
workspace intentionally has no membership row. Workspace administrators,
other subjects, and cross-organization callers receive no corresponding
portable authority.

### Codex Apps designation parity verdict

- **Pelle/MCP:** the designated credential powers the direct model MCP. There is
  deliberately no Pelle mutation tool for choosing or clearing a human-owned
  credential; those actions require a same-origin managed-human browser session.
- **Search and command navigation:** this workspace setting is not indexed domain
  content. The existing Workspace settings route is its navigation surface; no
  separate command-palette action is warranted.
- **Event spine:** designation, clear, and disconnect-clear write secret-free audit
  events in the same transaction. They do not create session-history events or
  notifications because they are workspace configuration, not conversation work.
- **Mobile:** there is no native Opengeni administration surface. The responsive
  Workspace settings card is the supported mobile web surface.
- **Permissions and SDK:** REST and SDK mutations enforce the same
  `connections:write` managed-human boundary; enable additionally requires exact
  credential ownership, while disable does not.
- **Export and public links:** neither plane exposes credential selection or token
  material. Workspace state export remains unchanged.
- **Legal/processing scope:** this reuses the existing user-authorized ChatGPT
  connection and existing Apps destination. It adds no personal-data category,
  purpose, recipient, retention behavior, or additional owner field.

Docs MCP document retrieval projects the same canonical published Knowledge and
source revisions with permission-filtered passages. It is not another Memory or
reviewed-claim authoring system. First-party Knowledge tools provide explicit
pending-proposal reads; ordinary document search stays published-only.

Rules of thumb:

- Building a product **on top of** Opengeni (embed or API)? Per-session MCP is
  your integration point for host tools; the first-party MCP is your agents'
  steering wheel.
- Giving **every** session in a workspace a tool? Capability MCP.
- Do not proxy one MCP surface through another. Codemode is not an exception:
  it projects the worker's already-prepared attempt catalog and dispatches back
  into those same executor closures.
- A broker may refresh credentials after an upstream 401 for future requests,
  but it retries the current request only for the explicit replay-safe JSON-RPC
  allowlist: `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, and `tools/list`.
  Malformed bodies, unknown extensions, non-list methods, and any batch with an
  unsafe entry return secret-free outcome-uncertain error `40102` without a
  second physical request and instruct the caller to verify provider state.
- Embedded hosts that already own provider connections should bind
  `ConnectionCredentialsPort.mcpCredentials` on both the API and worker. The
  host's connection remains authoritative; the sandbox bearer is never treated
  as a second GitHub/GitLab/Azure identity.
