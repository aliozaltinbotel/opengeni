//! The op-stream job pump: one tokio task per job, streaming a contained
//! child's output through the pure op engine to an injected frame sink.
//!
//! This module is TRANSPORT-FREE (the engine integration contract §"The job
//! runner"): it emits engine [`Frame`]s through a send hook and receives
//! [`JobCommand`]s through a mailbox. NATS subjects, protobuf encoding, and
//! publish failures are the supervisor's business; the pump never blocks on the
//! hook. The engine ([`RetentionLog`] + [`CreditFlow`]) owns every durability
//! and flow-control decision — the pump is the impure choreography around it.
//!
//! # The pump contract (binding, from ENGINE-INTEGRATION.md + PROTOCOL.md v1.1)
//!
//! * Reads of stdout/stderr share one budget and stop jointly: while attached
//!   the gate is `flow.allowance() > 0` (window exhaustion stops reads → the
//!   child blocks on write(2) → end-to-end throttle); while detached, and while
//!   draining after child exit, the gate is retention headroom (ruling M2).
//! * Ack accounting: freed sent-bytes are computed against retention BEFORE
//!   anything is freed (the frames are gone afterwards), and EVERY ack side
//!   effect — the credit window, the retention floor, final-ack honoring — is
//!   gated on the flow's `Applied` outcome (strict generation fencing,
//!   design-review ruling 2026-07-10: only the exact current attach
//!   generation speaks for the live consumer; stale AND future generations
//!   are refused wholesale).
//! * Frames are emitted in strictly ascending seq order — the engine's
//!   `on_sent` contract. When a frame cannot be sent at append time (window
//!   exhausted, detached, or mid-replay exhaustion) it stays retained and
//!   `flow.sent_hi()` becomes the pending-send cursor: every credit/attach
//!   event resumes sending from there ([`Pump::catch_up`]). A Progress tick
//!   appended while the pump is caught up is emitted immediately even with a
//!   zero allowance (credit-free — the M1 healing channel); one appended while
//!   data frames are still queued is emitted in order behind them, and M1
//!   healing rides the server's 5s re-ack timer leg instead.
//! * Progress ticks append every `progress_interval` of data silence while the
//!   op is alive — attached or not (they consume seqs and are retained, so gap
//!   detection stays uniform).
//! * The Exit frame is appended exactly once, on every path. If even the Exit
//!   append fails (retention already exhausted — the overflow path), the exit
//!   is NOT emitted as a frame; the [`JobHooks::on_exit`] lifecycle hook still
//!   fires (with `exit_seq: None`) and the supervisor answers `OpQuery` from
//!   the registry — honest, typed, never silent.
//! * After Exit the task lingers, serving Ack/Attach (replay of retained
//!   frames including the Exit) until a current-generation final ack or the
//!   supervisor drops the mailbox — completed-op replay is how a reconnecting
//!   server collects results; registry GC (supervisor scope) drops the mailbox.
//!
//! Input hygiene decisions (documented here because the wire can be hostile):
//! an `Attach.from_seq` beyond the high watermark is clamped to it (attaching
//! "past the end" would poison the ascending-seq send order); an attach floor
//! below the retention floor is served from the retention floor (the freed
//! frames are gone; server reassembly is seq-idempotent, so over-serving is
//! safe); a `final_ack` before completion is applied as a plain ack and the
//! final flag ignored.
