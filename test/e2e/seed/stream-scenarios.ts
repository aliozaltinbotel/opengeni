/** Long prose wall — stress tip-follow under mostly-fast streaming. */
const MARKDOWN_HUGE_WALL = `## Long-form streaming stress

This answer is intentionally **huge**: several dense paragraphs at near-model
speed so tip-follow, soft ink, and crystallize get a real workout. Skim the
shape; the point is motion under load, not the prose itself.

The session timeline has to stay honest while an agent narrates for a long
time. That means the pinned tip must float upward as content grows, never
teleport by a full line on every token batch, and never yank a reader who
scrolled up into history. When the model is slow, each new line should ease
into place without a strange laggy chase. When the model is fast, debt to the
bottom must clear quickly so the reader never feels stuck watching the tip
race away below the fold. Those two regimes share one glide; only the time
constant changes with recent growth velocity and how far we are from the tip.

In practice a turn rarely stays pure prose. Tools interrupt, reasoning opens
and closes, sandboxes warm, and mid-turn clusters fold while the live tail
keeps streaming. The outer settle fold has to choreograph that handoff: hold
the rows the reader was watching, ease the summary chip in, then glide closed
without remounting nested chips mid-collapse. If any of that snaps, the whole
stream reads as jagged even when the scroll math is fine. So this wall of
text is also a rehearsal for the quieter moments that follow — a long calm
stretch, then a soft landing.

Deployment notes belong in the same breath. The API remains the only public
surface; Postgres is durable truth; NATS is live fanout; Temporal orchestrates
but never carries token streams in workflow history. Context compaction is one
portable plaintext checkpoint, not an opaque provider blob, because sessions
rotate across subscription identities. Goals wake through a Postgres
obligation, never a polling loop. None of that changes because we are
stressing the UI — it is the reason the UI must stay calm under long runs.

Sandbox targets stay pluggable. Docker is the local default; Modal and the
other cloud boxes are swappable; a Connected Machine is a co-equal primary
compute target, not a phantom box behind a lease. Machine-primary turns never
clone repos onto the user's disk and never export platform git credentials.
The control plane talks NATS; heartbeats stay off the work pool so a full
queue cannot mark the machine offline. When this wall mentions sandboxes, it
is only to keep those invariants in the reader's peripheral vision while the
paragraphs keep arriving.

Markdown itself is part of the stress. Headings, emphasis, inline code like
\`overflow-anchor\`, and occasional links such as
[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) all reflow while tokens land. Softening
unfinished markers prevents punctuation flashes; tip ink washes the young
suffix; crystallize settles the body when the stream ends. A fast wall should
still feel like one surface being painted, not a stack of cards slamming in.

Here is another block at the same density. Imagine the agent is explaining a
migration plan across API, worker, and web: expand columns, dual-write, cut
readers over, then contract. Every step emits timeline evidence. The reader
pinned at the tip watches narration grow for minutes. Soft follow must absorb
multi-line bursts without jagged ratchets, and a slow trailing sentence must
not revive burst urgency from a hundred milliseconds ago. Velocity decays when
growth pauses; debt urgency only spikes when the tip actually falls behind.

Keep going through the middle of the essay. Product copy often underestimates
how long a competent agent will talk when the task is open-ended. Days-long
runs are in scope. The UI cannot treat a long answer as an edge case. Scroll
ownership stays simple: pinned tip is scripted glide; history is native
anchoring; \`hasNewer\` pages never pretend to be the live tip. If those rules
hold, a wall like this is boring in the best way — content moves, the tip
stays readable, nothing fights the reader.

One more large paragraph before the close. Think about queue edits, Agent
Steer, approvals, and capacity waits all landing while prose continues. The
timeline projects them into clusters and notices without feeding audit events
back into model memory. Human-facing motion and model-facing truth stay on
separate rails. Watching this paragraph stream is a cheap proxy for that
separation holding under speed: layout can churn; authority cannot.

### Why the length

1. Tip-follow under sustained growth
2. Ink band under large append batches
3. Crystallize after a long body
4. No history yank if you scroll away mid-wall
`;

const MARKDOWN_HUGE_WALL_CLOSE = `### Soft landing

That was the fast pass. This coda arrives slower on purpose — let the glide
calm down, watch the last lines ease in, then crystallize. If follow still
feels jagged here, the slow path is the bug; if the wall above raced away,
the fast catch-up path needs more urgency.
