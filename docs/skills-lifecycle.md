# Unified Skill content and writes

`packages/core/src/domain/skills.ts` exports `listSkills`, `readSkill`,
`saveSkill`, `installSkill`, `approveSkill` and `restoreSkill`.
`packages/contracts/src/skills.ts` owns their shared inputs and receipts.
`packages/db/src/skills.ts` is the driver-neutral persistence adapter;
`skill_apply_lifecycle(uuid, uuid, jsonb, jsonb)` is the atomic database boundary.

## Permanent removal

The human Skills editor exposes **Remove skill** for saved personal/workspace
Skills, including inactive Skills. Confirmation names the Skill and explains
permanent deletion of all revisions. The SDK `removeWorkspaceSkill` calls
`POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/skills/content/:skillId/remove`, using the same
human scope authorization as Save and the core removal lifecycle below. Retries
retain the operation ID and exact version arguments; after deletion, the
content-free receipt supplies scope for authorization before lifecycle replay.
Organization Skills and shared distribution owners retain their existing removal
restrictions. Opening details preserves the source Capabilities tab, and inactive
and pending status remain visible in the installed list.

The lazy agent tool `skill_remove` and core `removeSkill` permanently delete the
saved Skill identity and **all registry revisions and files**, including pending
revisions. This is distinct from source uninstall/deactivation and is not
recoverable through Skill restore. No soft-deleted content head is retained.
Conversation history, accepted context snapshots and minimal operation audit
identifiers are unchanged. Shared upstream source packages and their immutable
distribution files are not erased by deleting one workspace's installed Skill.

Removal uses the same accepted actor, personal/workspace scope, Learning policy,
live-attempt checks, publication lock and operation-key replay as `skill_save`.
Supply `operationId`, `skillId`, `expectedRevisionId` (current active head, or
null), `expectedScopeVersion` and `reason`. Built-in, repository and inline
session identities are not registry UUIDs and cannot be removed through this
tool. Organization Skills are outside its scope. Off refuses new changes;
Automatic applies deletion; Review first retains a removal proposal in
Knowledge > Needs review without interrupting the task.

A removal proposal is a marked, immutable revision, never executable guidance.
The review surfaces explicitly label irreversible deletion. Human approval must
include the exact `removalOperationId`, proposal revision, original head and
scope version. A normal approval request without that deletion binding fails.
The existing verified-human chat response path also validates the exact deletion
text and choices; ordinary Save cards cannot authorize deletion. A newer proposed
or active revision, a scope change, or a prior rejection invalidates approval.
Rejection keeps the Skill. Legacy activation and restore cannot activate a
removal proposal as content.

Successful removal returns `removed: true, outcome: applied`; pending and rejected
receipts return `removed: false`. Reuse identical arguments and operation ID after
uncertainty. Committed removal replays without reading deleted content, but still
requires valid live actor authority. Changed arguments with the same key fail.
Direct database deletion remains unavailable to runtime roles. Only the scoped
SECURITY DEFINER lifecycle can open the exact-head deletion guard; head deletion
cascades to its revisions, events and source binding. Content-free operation
receipts remain replayable, with their deleted activation-event link cleared by
the foreign key. This prevents delayed save retries from recreating a deleted Skill.
Scoped proposal audit rows with live references are removed. Cross-Skill
references still fail atomically rather than deleting another Skill's history.

A direct installation releases only its scoped Skill facet. A non-direct
distribution owner must first be released through its existing authorized
lifecycle; removal refuses rather than modifying unrelated components. Removed
source content can be explicitly installed again as a new Skill; old operation
receipts remain historical results, not proof of a current installation.

Migration `0488_permanent_skill_removal.sql` is a maintenance cutover. Drain all
API/control/turn workers, provide the complete runtime role list, migrate and
provision roles, then start matching binaries. Never restart pre-0487 binaries:
old review UIs do not label removal intent. The migration changes no historical
conversation or Skill content; it adds the removal marker and guarded lifecycle.

A Skill has exactly one scoped identity and current head in
`preference_registry_preferences`, and one immutable revision history in
`preference_registry_revisions`. A revision's `skill_files` is its complete
UTF-8 text folder, including nonempty `SKILL.md`. Limits are 1,024 files,
2 MiB per file, and 8 MiB total. Individual reads remain limited to 128 paths
and 512 KiB of output; use checkout for larger files. Paths are root-relative, unique, and cannot
contain traversal, backslashes, absolute paths, control characters, or drive
prefixes. NUL, malformed Unicode, and binary storage are unsupported.

Historical single-text revisions retain NULL `skill_files` and project their
exact `content` as `SKILL.md`. Historical content hashes and snapshots are not
rewritten. The existing content hash remains the hash of `SKILL.md`, not the
folder; `skillBundleHash` separately identifies the full canonical text folder.
Activation mode is frozen with the revision. Session-selected portable Skills
remain excluded from ambient registry snapshots, including after customization;
explicit selection can still materialize their current folder.

Portable source identity is `(workspace_id, plugin_id, facet_key)`, bound to
the registry identity by `skill_source_bindings`. No matching by name or
content takes place. Portable plugins, immutable versions/facets/files,
installations, and owners continue to describe distribution and upstream
ownership, but no longer choose a second mutable content head. Source updates
may advance an uncustomized source revision; they preserve a human- or
agent-customized active revision. Existing portable reads resolve the current
registry folder. An inactive proposal is never returned as an installed active
Skill. Legacy single-text saves of source-bound Skills fail closed rather than
silently dropping supporting files.

## Authority and receipts

The session UI also offers nonblocking approval of pending Skills. It reads the
paginated Skill content catalog with `sessionId`, after session-read authorization,
and filters by the originating agent's durable write receipt. This lookup does
not depend on the loaded conversation window. Only current, unsettled proposals
are returned; file bodies are fetched for the exact revision through the existing
content API. Approval uses the same human-authorized Skill endpoint and revision
fences as the Skills page. Deleted and settled proposals do not reappear from
historical tool outputs. The chat does not need to enter `requires_action`.

HTTP callers must authenticate and authorize workspace/scope management before
constructing a human actor. `principalKind: human_session` is a trusted boundary
fact, not a model argument. Humans bypass Learning, not authorization. Existing
organization and personal preference scope visibility remains intact.

Authenticated service/API-key callers install sources as a distinct `service`
actor, never as a human. This authority is limited to workspace installation:
Learning Off refuses it, Suggest retains a pending revision, and Automatic makes
the revision live. Machine callers cannot approve revisions, write authored
folders, restore history, or remove a final Skill source through this actor.
Those operations are not silently attributed to an initiating human.

Agent claims must come from the live host attempt, never the tool arguments.
The database binds account, workspace, session, active turn, active attempt,
execution generation, state, and interruptions. Agent writes are workspace-only
and attributed to `service:skill-attempt:<attempt id>`; no human impersonation,
Knowledge evidence, or confidence score is involved. All workspace agents share
the same Skill management authority; there is no per-agent or per-Skill ACL.

Learning reads the current workspace policy under a shared lock: Off refuses
durable writes, Suggest saves an inactive revision, and Automatic activates a
valid revision directly. No active policy defaults to Suggest, matching the
workspace Learning default. Migration 0435 adds this response path without rewriting the published 0433 cutover. It defaults historical answers to untrusted and preserves the existing lifecycle function grants. This is a maintenance cutover: drain every API, control-worker and turn-worker, supply their exact runtime database roles, apply 0435, and start only the new binaries. Never restart a pre-0435 runtime: an old API can answer a new typed Skill question without activating the revision. Require approval uses one in-chat decision, not a
second review queue: pending agent receipts carry an immutable `skillReview`
reference. `request_human_input` displays that revision's complete text folder
through the existing scoped content API. The verified initiating human chooses
Save. Response admission records the answer and activates the same revision
through the existing head transition in one transaction, before emitting the
resume event. No model call or provider availability is needed to finish saving. The pending
entry disappears from the current read projection after activation. Don't save records a revision-specific rejection and preserves any active Skill.
Other, expired requests, agent answers and noncanonical bearer responses never
activate a Skill.

New typed Skill questions must match the host-owned confirmation text and
choices before the runtime normalizes known wire differences. A typed reference
does not authorize replacing misleading prompts, labels or descriptions. The
canonical result has one dedicated question, no Other and no
request skip. This constructs a review card, not consent or authority; the
database still verifies the reference against its immutable source receipt.

Migration 0458 is a rolling compatibility fix over 0435. It changes no stored
cards, historical answers, grants, or authorization stamps. An existing pending
card with the canonical text and exact choices may have `allowOther: true` and
absent or null option descriptions. The initiating human must explicitly answer
Save or Don't save again through normal authorized response admission. Other
answers cannot confirm. Every receipt, live authority, turn/generation, expiry,
head and revision fence still applies; altered labels, non-null descriptions or
references are not repaired. There is no automatic approval or backfill, and
no need to rewrite the audit history. Rolling back the application to a
0435-or-newer binary retains this narrow database compatibility; do not undo the
migration or restart a pre-0435 binary. Deployment and the actual human decision
remain separate operations.

Database settlement uses the same canonical presentation validator and never
forces Other onto a new Skill card. If another interruption is answered first,
the remaining Skill request may re-freeze in the next execution generation.
Settlement preserves its existing question bytes only after its stable request
identity, full canonical presentation and complete typed reference match. The
original pending-status, skip and deadline predicates remain exact, and only
generation ownership advances. Unknown fields, changed references, misleading
text, altered deadlines or settled requests do not qualify for compatibility.

Confirmation validates the canonical prompt, label, help text, choices and typed
reference against the original immutable receipt. The logical turn, initiating
human, current workspace authority, full revision identity, latest revision,
current head and scope version must still agree. A later edit
requires a fresh proposal. The response-admission proof is stored separately as
`skill_review_human_authorized`; subject strings and an agent's claimed consent
are never human authority. Confirmed writes are attributed to the verified
answering human. Repeated response delivery returns its original durable event
and activation without a second save. Stale-head or authorization failure rolls
back both answer and activation, so the UI does not claim a successful save.

Autonomous saves activate directly and return no human-input payload. Off
refuses new durable agent changes. Human UI approval still activates an exact
revision with head CAS. Restore saves the selected historical folder as a new immutable revision
and follows the same actor/Learning rules.

Every accepted write returns an immutable operation receipt containing
`operationId`, `skillId`, `revisionId`, `outcome` (`applied`, `pending`, or
`preserved`), and `replayed`. Identical operation-key retries return the same
receipt; changed input with the same key fails. Saves, approvals, and restores
require both `expectedRevisionId` and `expectedScopeVersion`; stale requests
fail rather than overwriting intervening work. A retry still requires a valid
actor; a stale attempt cannot use replay to regain access.

`installPortableSkill` requires a truthful `skillActor` and optionally accepts
`skillOperationId`; it commits distribution and the registry transition in the
same transaction. Callers omitting actor context fail before any write. Its
return includes `skillReceipt`, so pending installation must not be reported as
activated. `installSkill` alone requires an already-installed portable facet.
Portable install retries acquire the existing Skill operation lock and replay
before distribution writes or installation-version CAS. The same immutable
Skill receipt retains a private original-request hash and original installation
result (including the original `created` value); this is a historical operation
result, not a fresh claim about current installation state. Public lifecycle
receipts do not expose this envelope. Replay rechecks
the actual actor and exact live agent attempt through the existing lifecycle.
`replayPortableSkillInstall` (DB and core export) can run before remote source
resolution. Its `requestIdentity` must match the install's `skillRequestIdentity`:
host-canonical original source/URL, options, owner and explicit installation CAS,
not a freshly resolved commit or folder. Adapters must construct this identity,
not accept a caller-provided hash. Without an explicit identity, install binds
the full resolved input; callers cannot safely replay a moving URL before
resolution. Receipts predating the envelope fail closed, not reconstruct a
possibly changed installation. A missing operation ID means a new operation.
Last-owner direct and plugin removal resolves the canonical head atomically
with distribution cleanup through `skill-source-release.ts`. Source-managed
workspace heads deactivate through the existing human registry lifecycle;
customized or re-scoped heads remain active and return an explicit preservation
warning. Immutable source bindings and history survive uninstall. Deleting the
owning workspace instead removes its workspace-owned Skills, revisions/events,
bindings, and write/conversion receipts through the parent cascade. Organization,
personal, and other-workspace Skills are unaffected. Direct history deletion
remains forbidden; corrupt cross-scope references cause atomic failure rather
than removal of surviving history. Existing workspace-deletion eligibility and
authorization checks still apply. Physical owners,
including pending Plugin owners, prevent cleanup even when not runtime-effective.
The removal and upgrade-finalization APIs accept `skillActor`; removing a bound
Skill requires a trusted `human_session` actor. Missing, service/API-key, and agent
authority fails closed and rolls back. A subject ID is never treated as proof of
human authority. No new agent deactivation authority is introduced here.
Removal results expose `skillReleases` with the Skill/revision IDs, disposition,
event ID, and warning. Plugin finalizers return these receipts too;
plugin operation replay retains them. Plugin adapters must retain returned receipts
when finalizing their operation result.

## Release

### Composite source publication

An unfinished Plugin owner cannot publish newly installed guidance. An
otherwise-Automatic child install saves an inactive revision and returns
`outcome: pending, pendingReason: source_finalization`. Its immutable write receipt
retains the deferred intent and the expected head, scope version, and source facet.
Suggest proposals are not marked for automatic publication.

Successful Plugin finalization changes the owner status and publishes
eligible deferred revisions in the same database transaction. A private status
trigger, `skill_publish_finalized_owner`, has no runtime EXECUTE grant. Install,
replay, parent preparation and finalization serialize on the workspace publication
lock before their component/operation locks. Finalization checks the latest
revision, immutable source, head/scope CAS, expiry and effective owner; newer
customization or source intent wins. Machine-originated intents also recheck
current Learning. Agent-originated intents require the original exact live
attempt without a pending interruption; closed/replaced attempts remain pending
for human approval. Human-originated authorization still bypasses Learning, not
the owner gate. Both unified approval and legacy files-bearing activation reject
an unfinished source owner.

Publication appends a separate immutable receipt in `skill_write_receipts`, with
a deterministic operation ID, `sourceOperationId` and `activationEventId`.
Original install receipts are never rewritten: replay can truthfully return the
original pending result after publication. Parent finalizers return supplemental
`skillPublications` and persist them in the parent operation's replay result.
Plugin API adapters must forward these completion receipts; they must
not relabel the earlier `skillWrites` as if those installs were already applied.
The publication event is attributed to `service:skill-publication`; any retained
human-confirmed authority is derived from the original immutable human receipt,
not fabricated human execution identity.

There is no current-owner filter in historical snapshot reads. Owner readiness is
checked only at activation, and before/after snapshots retain the exact historical
event boundary. Pre-0426 active child installations lacking an effective owner
must be completed or disabled before migration; cutover fails clearly rather
than inventing publication authority for unfinished historical composite work.

After cutover every new revision must have files, including legacy human CREATE;
activation of historical null-files revisions fails closed. History reads remain
available. Save, install, restore and approval derive metadata with the one
`@opengeni/contracts` parser. Valid YAML bytes and decoded metadata are preserved;
SQL enforces structure, hashes, actor/tenant authority and atomicity, not a second
interpretation of YAML. Restore requires valid frontmatter; plain archived content
must be explicitly repaired through save. Files-bearing activation remains
compatible with human governance.

The old Knowledge-backed preference proposal service is retired as well.
`writeCompanyBrainGovernedProposal` rejects `propose_preference` and
`promote_task_note_preference` before materializing Knowledge evidence or change
proposals. Its legacy SQL capability retains its signature but always refuses
writes with an explicit `skill_save` redirect error. Existing Knowledge,
instruction-policy, and historical proposal/receipt reads are unchanged. New
Skills must use the shared file lifecycle and simple Learning mode, not the
Knowledge confidence/evidence evaluator.

The exported `createRememberRouter().remember()` domain entry point also rejects
new `lane=preference` requests with `RememberError.code = "preference_retired"`
before creating a Task note, policy snapshot, proposal, or confirmation question,
regardless of Learning mode. MCP already redirects that lane to `skill_save`.
The historical confirmation and receipt schemas remain readable; Knowledge and
instruction-policy remember/confirm workflows retain their existing behavior.

The exact 0433 runner stage executes inside an explicit migration transaction:
setup and owner window, TypeScript parsing into a temporary staging table, then
SQL backfill/guards and the migration ledger receipt. Raw SQL without that stage
fails closed. All existing active authored heads receive new canonical revisions;
original revisions, hashes, scope and provenance remain in history. Already valid
frontmatter wins over stale DB metadata and keeps its exact bytes. Plain text gets
a deterministic header from legacy metadata without changing its body. Legacy
names use a safe lowercase slug, or `legacy-<stable UUID>` if no legal name can be
derived without truncation. Invalid/ambiguous headers and oversized descriptions
abort the entire cutover for explicit repair. No malformed record is silently
dropped, and no additional summary field is created.

The installed-source backfill opens an owner-only `NO FORCE` window on the four
portable source tables and the registry heads, revisions, events, and source
bindings. RLS stays enabled for application roles. Deferred proposal-event and
foreign-key constraints are flushed before restoring FORCE RLS, all within the
migration transaction. A seeded `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` owner test verifies
cross-tenant identity preservation, folder content, and the restored posture.

Migration `0433_unified_skill_lifecycle.sql` is a maintenance cutover. Drain all
old API/control/turn workers, supply the exact application database role list,
migrate, provision roles, and start only the unified-Skill-aware release. Never
restart a pre-0433 binary: its installed reads bypass the registry content head.
The migration preserves existing source ownership, backfills installed Skills
by portable identity, and rejects invalid existing folders for repair rather
than silently truncating them. New binding/write-receipt tables are FORCE-RLS and
read-only for the runtime role; mutation requires the exact SECURITY DEFINER
lifecycle capability.

### Stored execution configuration maintenance

The same atomic 0433 runner calls `packages/db/src/skill-config-migration.ts`
after staging registry metadata. It converts headerless Skills in current
`sessions.skills` and `workspace_packs.manifest` (including inline automation
template Skills). It uses historical name/description, preserves the complete
body and supporting UTF-8 file bytes, and applies the shared parser and folder
limits. Valid YAML, its cached descriptor fields, unrelated manifest fields,
and source timestamps remain unchanged; the stored read projections derive
canonical metadata without rewriting those bytes. Names that cannot be slugged
use a stable source/array-position hash, never content-based identity or merging.
Canonical name collisions, malformed/apparent YAML headers, missing historical
metadata and overflow are repair-required, not silently normalized or dropped.

Before replacing any current configuration, the migration inserts its original
JSON, PostgreSQL JSONB-text SHA-256, replacement hash, tenant/source identity,
conversion version and truthful migration actor into
`skill_config_conversion_receipts` in the same transaction. These receipts survive
source replacement, but cascade with deletion of their owning workspace, using
the existing document-migration receipt retention pattern. Direct updates and
deletes remain forbidden. This is immutable maintenance evidence, not another
Skill head. The table has FORCE RLS and **no
runtime table privileges**, including SELECT: an archived private Session's
configuration must not become workspace-readable audit content. Authorized
database maintenance uses explicit account/workspace context to inspect it.
Workspace tenancy advisory locks, table locks and old-value CAS protect writes;
the conversion entry also verifies that it is running as the table owner inside
the parser-backed migration's temporary owner window. It cannot be reused as an
ordinary runtime session-configuration writer.
The migration ledger makes committed retries no-ops. A failure rolls back all
configuration changes, receipts, registry conversion and schema changes.

The following notes document historical migration 0433, which runs before the
destructive Pack-removal migration. Archived Pack JSON is migration evidence,
not a current API contract or runtime compatibility layer.

The owner-only RLS window also covers current configurations and the exact
Session/automation/Pack tables read by preflight; FORCE is restored before commit.
Preflight reports source kinds/IDs and blocker counts without content. It refuses
conversion when plain inline Session Skills have a nonterminal accepted turn or
an active-turn pointer. It also refuses plain or invalid Skills in non-disabled
Pack installation snapshots, active/paused current automation revisions, queued
or dispatching accepted runs, and accepted event matches not yet assigned a run.
Already assigned events do not independently block after their run is terminal.

Operator repair requirements:

- Before stopping old runtimes, complete or explicitly cancel affected accepted
  work. Stopping database clients alone does not retire accepted execution pins.
- Replace active plain automation templates with a newly validated revision, or
  explicitly disable the trigger. Pausing alone is not archival. Preserve every
  old revision and accepted execution payload.
- Explicitly disable or replace active plain Pack sources through an appropriate
  audited lifecycle. Migration never rewrites `pack_installations.manifest_snapshot`
  or its digest, published plugin versions/facets/files, or accepted event matches.
  Ordinary Pack re-admission overwrites the current installation snapshot: archive
  that original separately before using re-admission as an operator repair.
- Repair malformed mutable source configuration explicitly, then retry the whole
  migration. The failure inventory reports up to 30 IDs and the total blocker
  count; repeat preflight after repairs if further IDs remain.

Disabled Pack snapshots, noncurrent/disabled automation revisions, terminal runs
and immutable audit history remain unchanged. Re-enabling a plain historical
artifact still requires explicit valid replacement; no read-time synthesis or
silent rebinding is supported. Deployment/host configuration outside these DB
sources needs its own validation. This maintenance inventory materializes source
JSON in memory and has not been load-tested on a large production dataset.
