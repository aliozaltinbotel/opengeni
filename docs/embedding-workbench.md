# Embedding the Opengeni Workbench

This guide is for a host app that wants to drop the Opengeni **session workspace**
— the Changes / Files / Terminal / Browser / Computer dock, with instant cold paint and the
machine-state chip — into its own UI. It is the frontend companion to the
standalone SDK/proxy integration as well as the advanced in-process path in
`docs/embedding.md`. It is the exact surface `apps/web` itself consumes (see
`apps/web/src/components/session/sandbox-workspace.tsx`), so an external
embedder and the first-party app run the same code path.

Shipping that code path is not acceptance by itself. The required live,
performance, accessibility, identity-race, browser/device, and visual evidence
is defined by [`workbench-acceptance.md`](workbench-acceptance.md).

Everything ships from `@opengeni/react`. The whole dock "brain" — capability
negotiation, capture-backed cold reads, tab construction, prewarm, and the
machine chip — lives in `packages/react/src/components/sandbox-workspace.tsx`; you
mount one component.

## 1. Install

```sh
npm install @opengeni/react @opengeni/sdk react react-dom
```

`@opengeni/react` depends only on `@opengeni/sdk` among Opengeni packages (a
client-clean closure — no server code is pulled in). `react` and `react-dom`
(v18 or v19) are required peers.

### Optional peer dependencies (per surface)

The workbench lazy-loads the heavy surface renderers, so you only install the
peers for the surfaces you actually render. Missing a peer degrades that one
surface to a notice; it never crashes the dock.

| Surface | Install when you want… | Packages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terminal | the interactive xterm PTY | `@xterm/xterm`, `@xterm/addon-fit`, `@xterm/addon-web-links` |
| Files editor | in-browser code editing | `@uiw/react-codemirror` + the `@codemirror/lang-*` grammars you need |
| Changes diff | the Pierre diff renderer | `@pierre/diffs` |
| Browser | browser-native tabs, semantic state, frames, and input | None |
| Computer | semantic app/window/screen state, frames, and input | None |
| Legacy `DesktopViewer` primitive | direct noVNC framebuffer embedding outside `SandboxWorkspace` | `@novnc/novnc` |

The authoritative list is the `peerDependencies` block of the package manifest
(`packages/react/package.json`).

The root keeps every existing export but does not import optional peers. Enable
the installed surface libraries once from their opt-in entry in your client
route; registration is synchronous and libraries load only on mount:

```ts
import { enableSandboxTerminal } from "@opengeni/react/terminal";
import { enableCodeEditor } from "@opengeni/react/editor";

enableSandboxTerminal();
enableCodeEditor({
  javascript: async () =>
    (await import("@codemirror/lang-javascript")).javascript({ jsx: true, typescript: true }),
});
```

Include only the setup entries and grammar loaders for packages you installed.
For direct VNC, use `enableDesktopViewer()` from `@opengeni/react/desktop`.
Highlighted diffs use `enablePierreDiffs()` from `@opengeni/react/diffs`.
Optional terminal WebGL uses
`enableSandboxTerminal({ webgl: () => import("@xterm/addon-webgl") })`;
without that addon, the DOM renderer remains available. Root component imports
still work after setup. See the [React peer setup](../packages/react/README.md#optional-peer-dependencies).

## 2. Provider And Trust Boundary

Wrap the tree once in `OpenGeniProvider`, giving it an Opengeni client and the
workspace id. Every hook and component below reads the client from here (there is
no app-context coupling — that is what makes the workbench embeddable).

Keep privileged Opengeni credentials on the host server. The browser client
below points at a tenant-scoped, same-origin host proxy that preserves the
Opengeni route contract. A host may instead pass any structural client matching
the methods used by the mounted surfaces.

```tsx
import { OpenGeniProvider } from "@opengeni/react";
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/api/opengeni" });

export function Root({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
      {children}
    </OpenGeniProvider>
  );
}
```

The client is structural (`SessionClientLike`): if you already have your own
transport, any object with the same method surface works. See
`packages/react/src/client.ts`.

## 3. Styles

For the styled workbench, import the ready-to-use stylesheet once from the host
application entry. The host does not need Tailwind or a package source scan:

```tsx
import "@opengeni/react/compiled.css";
```

The artifact omits Preflight, scopes every utility to `.og-root`, and does not
register Tailwind's global `--tw-*` properties. Independent token defaults
inherit without replacing host `--og-*` values; derived defaults use scoped
effective values, so accent, radius, motion, and surface relationships remain
live. Portalled components copy the trigger's effective tokens onto their
standalone roots.

Tailwind v4 hosts may instead keep the additive source bridge:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@opengeni/react/styles.css";
@import "@opengeni/react/responsive.css";
@source "../node_modules/@opengeni/react/src";
```

The small `responsive.css` layer is needed only when the source-bridge host uses
`responsiveBasis="container"`; `compiled.css` already contains it. Import one
styling path, not both. Hosts consuming only
`@opengeni/react/session` need no CSS; that headless subpath remains CSS-free.
For token-only use, import `@opengeni/react/tokens.css` directly.

## 4. Mount `<SandboxWorkspace>`

```tsx
import { SandboxWorkspace, useSessionEvents } from "@opengeni/react";

function Workspace({ sessionId }: { sessionId: string }) {
  const { events } = useSessionEvents(sessionId);
  return (
    <SandboxWorkspace
      sessionId={sessionId}
      events={events}
      primary={<YourChatPane sessionId={sessionId} />}
      onNotify={(n) => n.kind === "error" ? toast.error(n.message) : toast(n.message)}
    />
  );
}
```

That is the whole integration. The dock paints instantly from the latest
turn-end capture (no machine round-trip), then reconciles to live data when the
box is warm, with no tab switch or layout shift in between.

Live reconciliation batches the visible file-tree frontier into one
`fs/list-batch` request and all repository status/diff reads into one
`git/read-batch` request. Each batch acquires the session's Channel-A lease once
and runs its independent reads concurrently, avoiding repeated provider attach
and lease traffic as repository count or expanded folders grow. Separate Modal
read requests for the same exact live lease are serialized through a bounded
PostgreSQL advisory lock across API replicas, so load balancing cannot make two
reconstructed handles race the provider command transport. The individual
`fs/list`, `git/status`, and `git/diff` methods remain available for point reads.

Repository discovery walks the workspace filesystem without a fixed nesting
depth, recognizes both ordinary `.git` directories and linked-worktree `.git`
files, and prunes dependency/build residue. The walk is still bounded by a
timeout and repository-count guard. If either guard trips or discovery fails,
Opengeni persists and announces an explicit degraded revision instead of an
authoritative-looking empty capture; consumers keep live files authoritative.

An embedder can expose only the surfaces that belong in its product. For
example, this mounts review, file, and terminal capabilities without Desktop:

```tsx
<SandboxWorkspace
  sessionId={sessionId}
  events={events}
  primary={<YourChatPane sessionId={sessionId} />}
  surfaces={["changes", "files", "terminal"]}
/>
```

This is a behavioral allowlist, not just tab filtering. A surface outside the
list does not attach a stream or viewer, request its data, initiate a warm
intent, become the source-driven default, or receive cross-surface navigation.
Omit `surfaces` to retain the full standalone workbench. An empty list is valid
when a host wants only its own `leadingTabs` or `trailingTabs`; in that mode the
built-in machine-state chip is also omitted because no workbench capability is
being observed.

### Props worth knowing

| Prop | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sessionId`, `events` | the session and its live event log (from `useSessionEvents`). |
| `primary` | the pane shown beside the dock (your chat/timeline). |
| `surfaces` | built-in surface allowlist: `"changes"`, `"files"`, `"terminal"`, `"browser"`, `"desktop"` (`"desktop"` is the stable id of the Computer surface). Omit for all five. |
| `machinesEnabled` | whether the viewer may read the workspace machine fleet (`enrollments:read`). Default `true`. Pass `false` for viewers without it: the dock never requests `GET /machines` and the machine chip derives from the session's capabilities alone. Independently, a 401/403/404 from that read stops the poll until the read is disabled and re-enabled (a permission or workspace change) or explicitly refreshed. |
| `onNotify` | host-routed `{ kind: "error" \| "info"; message }` — the package has no toast dependency, so you decide how errors surface. |
| `leadingTabs` / `trailingTabs` | your own `WorkspaceTab[]` injected before / after the workbench tabs (this is how `apps/web` adds its Run and Debug tabs). |
| `initialTab` | override the default landing tab. A built-in tab excluded by `surfaces` is ignored. Omit it and the workbench chooses **Changes for reviewable durable capture changes, else Files**. A pending signed capture manifest leaves the initial choice unresolved; metadata arriving before the manifest must not be mistaken for an empty capture. Default selection never triggers live Git work. The choice latches before real content paints, so later edits never steal the current tab. |
| `openFileRequest` | a host request `{ path, line?, requestId }` that opens Files, passes the exact path to the selected session target, reveals its lazy tree ancestors, selects and scrolls the file, and optionally focuses a 1-based line. Change `requestId` to repeat the same open. |
| `openTabRequest` | a host request `{ tab, requestId }` that selects an available built-in or host-injected tab and expands the dock. Change `requestId` to repeat an open; ordinary rerenders do not steal the user's selection. Unknown tab IDs are ignored. This is presentation state, not artifact or compute authority. |
| `collapsed` / `onCollapsedChange` | drive the dock open/closed from your own toolbar. |

For chat or timeline Markdown, wire `Markdown.onSandboxFile` to
`SandboxWorkspace.openFileRequest`. `sandbox:` is an application protocol, not a
browser URL: the callback receives its percent-decoded path unchanged. A request
without a line opens the top of the file. Publication and download remain
separate, explicit retained-artifact actions.

Workspace surfaces use a vertical, keyboard-navigable activity rail. Up/Down
move between panels and Home/End jump to the ends. The rail becomes icon-first
when a desktop split is narrow, with accessible names and tooltips, and keeps
readable labels in overlays and maximized views. Visited panels stay mounted.

The machine-state chip is rendered in the dock header automatically. Managed
cold compute reads `Sleeping` with saved-workspace freshness, for example
`Sleeping · saved 2m ago`; this is capture freshness, not a heartbeat. A
Connected Machine that is genuinely unreachable reads `Offline`.

## 5. Theming

Every visual decision routes through `--og-*` CSS variables
(`packages/react/styles/tokens.css`). Override any of them under a scope you
control (`:root`, a wrapper element, or `[data-og-theme="light"]`) to rebrand the
whole workbench. The high-value tokens:

| Token | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `--og-color-bg` | the dock background. |
| `--og-color-surface-1` / `--og-color-surface-2` | raised panels, tab-strip and popover surfaces. |
| `--og-color-fg` / `--og-color-fg-muted` / `--og-color-fg-subtle` | primary / secondary / tertiary text. |
| `--og-color-border` / `--og-color-border-strong` | dividers and the dock frame. |
| `--og-color-accent` / `--og-color-accent-soft` | the active tab and selection accents. |
| `--og-color-status-running` / `--og-color-status-idle` / `--og-color-danger` | the machine chip dot, diff add/remove, and error text. |
| `--og-color-diff-add-bg` / `--og-color-diff-del-bg` | the Changes diff add/remove backgrounds. |
| `--og-font-sans` / `--og-font-mono` | UI vs. code/terminal typography. |
| `--og-font-size-xs` … `--og-font-size-md` | the compact SDK text ramp. Matching `--og-line-height-*` tokens control rhythm. |
| `--og-font-size-control` / `--og-font-size-menu` | compact chrome vs. dropdown/menu labels. |
| `--og-font-size-composer` / `--og-font-size-composer-wide` | composer text on the narrow and wide responsive basis. |
| `--og-model-picker-*` | picker trigger height, menu width/padding, row padding, and effort-row height. |
| `--og-realtime-menu-width` | realtime model menu width before viewport/container collision bounds. |
| `--og-radius-sm` … `--og-radius-xl` | corner rounding across the dock. |

Light mode is a first-class opt-in: set `data-og-theme="light"` on any ancestor.
Dark is the default. Set `data-og-density="compact"` (or
`class="og-density-compact"`) on an SDK ancestor for the supported embedded
sidebar preset. The defaults stay render-compatible with the web app's
current type sizes and control geometry. Portalled SDK surfaces copy all
effective `--og-*` values from their trigger, so locally scoped theme and
density overrides remain intact outside the ancestor DOM subtree.

Composer layout remains viewport-responsive by default for same-major render
compatibility. In a sidebar, split pane, or resizable card inside a wider page,
pass `responsiveBasis="container"` to `ChatComposer` or `Composer.Root`. The
root becomes an inline-size query container; nested model, realtime,
transcription, paused, and command controls follow its actual width. Portalled
model/realtime menus observe that same root and are bounded to it while retaining
the copied theme/density tokens. Pointer modality remains independent: container
width chooses information density, while coarse pointers choose 44px targets.
Source-bridge hosts import `@opengeni/react/responsive.css`; the compiled entry
already contains this layout layer.
