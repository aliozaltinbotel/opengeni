   Turn summary

   A completed (or failed/cancelled) turn folds behind one quiet summary chip:
   "N steps · M files · K commands · 1 screenshot · 4m". The chip is the default
   surface; expanding it reveals the full settled turn body. Top-level live
   activity keeps the same open shell so settling never remounts the rail into
   a brand-new wrapper (that remount was the hard yank).

   This keeps the timeline calm: a finished turn is a single line until the
   reader chooses to look inside it.
