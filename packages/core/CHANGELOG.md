# @opengeni/core

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 14990d0: A task started from Slack now starts from what the workspace offers every new session instead of the person's last website composer selection. Connectors follow the workspace default connector policy (including the person's own personal connections when that policy includes connected servers, still executable only through the frozen delegation snapshot), OpenGeni tools follow the workspace default selection, and the Sandbox Environment and its Variable Sets follow the workspace default. Only an explicitly chosen model carries over. Mentions, commands, DMs and shortcuts now always add the read-only Slack context tools, including when the workspace has its own default OpenGeni tool selection; reactions still do not.

  Repositories are the person's own recently used repositories in that workspace: those on the top-level sessions they started there in the last 30 days, most recent first, at most five, and only through their current entry in the workspace GitHub App catalog (same catalog and `github:use` permission as the website picker), on the default branch. Archived and empty repositories are skipped. A person with no recent repositories gets none; GitHub is asked only when there is something to look up, and an outage starts the task without repositories. These repositories are attached best effort.

  Repository resources gain an optional `optional: true` flag (contracts and SDK). A failed clone of such a repository logs a warning, is reported as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone` operation event, and no longer fails sandbox setup; a repository without the flag keeps the strict behavior. `GitHubRepository` gains optional `archived` and `sizeKb`, filled from GitHub when reported.

  The Slack acknowledgement adds one line naming what the task started with, for example `Using connectors: Gmail, Linear; repos: opengeni.` It names only connectors the first accepted turn can reach, so a personal-only connector the person never connected is not claimed. The line is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0529 adds the nullable `slack_interactions.session_defaults_line`), so a repaired acknowledgement re-renders identical bytes. A Slack message or a reacted-to message that links a workspace or session on a different deployment under the same parent domain (for example staging versus production) now carries a model-context note, so the agent says the link is for the other deployment instead of reporting the session as not found.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/core` removes `getActorNewSessionDefaults`. Use `getActorNewSessionModelChoice`, which returns only an explicitly chosen model policy. `@opengeni/db` adds `SlackInteraction.sessionDefaultsLine`, an optional `sessionDefaultsLine` input to `bindSlackInteractionSession` (written only by the bind that wins), `listRecentSessionRepositoryResources`, and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`.

### Minor Changes

- 3f9c757: An organization service key can change an existing external member's
  permissions in one shared workspace without removing and re-adding them:
  `PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/workspaces/:workspaceId/external-members/:membershipId`
  (`updateExternalWorkspaceMember` in the SDK) with `{ operationId, permissions }`.
  It is keyed and idempotent like a grant, capped by the key's permissions, and
  never cancels or tears down work. Narrowing also advances the member's
  organization authorization revision so frozen authority re-checks on next use.
  Rolling migration 0540 adds the `update` action to the external membership
  operation ledger.
- f986809: Scheduled tasks can post to one Slack channel as the OpenGeni workspace bot. A person chooses the channel in the schedule editor ("Post to Slack" under Advanced), stored as `agentConfig.slackBotChannelId` next to `slackBotConnectionId`. Choosing or changing it needs a signed-in person with `connections:write`, and the bot must be a member of an active channel that is not shared with another organization. Agents, services and API keys cannot set or change it. `listScheduledTaskSlackChannels` in the SDK lists the eligible channels.

  Runs of such a task get two tools, `slack_bot_prepare_message` and `slack_bot_send_prepared_message`, which take no channel. Prepare saves the exact text; send posts it to the task's channel with the saved server-owned id as the Slack post operation id, so a retried send never posts twice. Both re-read the task at every call, so clearing or changing the channel takes effect immediately and never redirects an already prepared message. Rolling migration 0530 adds the private prepared-message table and its two capabilities.

- 1ea4c69: Show when a scheduled task's frozen access is out of date, let its owner refresh it, and tell the owner when a run could not use a connector.

  For the task owner (or, for a task without an owner, people who manage schedules), scheduled task reads include a read-only `policyDrift`: workspace default connectors the task lacks, connectors the workspace no longer sets up, default OpenGeni tools missing from an agent-created task's frozen creator policy, connectors whose chosen account can no longer be used, and connectors with no account although one is now available. `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/scheduled-tasks/:taskId/refresh-access` (SDK `refreshScheduledTaskAccess`) re-freezes exactly that with the calling person's current authority through the ordinary owner update path. Only a signed-in person may call it; API keys, services, delegated bearers and agents cannot, a changed task returns 409, and a refreshed creator policy keeps a frozen permission only while that person holds it, adds only the permissions its newly added tools need (within the default worker set and that person's grant), and never changes the creator session policy.

  Scheduled runs whose own turn recorded `tool.auth_needed` carry `accessFailures`, and `GET .../scheduled-tasks/attention` (SDK `listScheduledTaskAccessAttention`) lists schedules whose latest run failed that way until a later run succeeds. It also lists schedules the scheduler refuses before creating a run because a chosen connector account can no longer be used (`unavailableAccounts`, with a null `runId` and `firedAt`), checked at read time with the same account plan as the drift; each item carries the task's `executionDigest`. The web console shows a dot on the Schedules navigation item, a badge on the schedule's row, a notice on the schedule's page with a one-click refresh, and the failure on each run row.

  The refresh accepts an optional `leaveOut` naming default connectors and OpenGeni tools to keep off the schedule; it only narrows what the refresh adds. The schedule page's "Keep without these" hides those defaults in that browser for the reviewed task head and passes them as `leaveOut` when the owner refreshes.

  `@opengeni/contracts` exports `ScheduledTaskPolicyDrift`, `ScheduledTaskAccessConnector`, `ScheduledTaskRunAccessFailure`, `ScheduledTaskAccessAttention`, `ListScheduledTaskAccessAttentionResponse`, and `RefreshScheduledTaskAccessRequest`; `ToolAuthNeededReason` is unchanged but now declared earlier in the module. `@opengeni/db` adds `listScheduledTaskCreatorPolicies`, `listScheduledTaskRunAuthNeededEvents`, `listScheduledTaskAccessAttentionEvents`, `listActiveScheduledTasksWithConnectionAccounts`, and `ScheduledTaskHeadChangedError`, and `updateScheduledTask` accepts `expectedExecutionDigest` and `creatorFirstPartyPolicy`.

- 30414a0: Add the first-party `session_set_model` MCP tool for changing an existing session's future model and reasoning defaults without waking it or rewriting accepted work. Preserve ordinary target authorization and exact-attempt fencing, provide stable idempotent receipts across reconnects, and report canonical model, reasoning and latency settings in full session readback. Share effective defaults across prompt admission, goal continuation, compaction and scheduled snapshots so older queued or resumed turns cannot undo an explicit choice. Deploy API and workers from a matched source cohort before using the new operation.
- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- d480872: Agent links to OpenGeni objects now work inside an embedding product. `artifact:` files download by default from `SessionConversation`; sandbox-path downloads require explicit proxy `sandboxFiles: true` and use bounded, no-symlink reads within the session working directory. Editable artifacts and Sites route through a new `resolveLink` prop (`MessageTimeline`, `SessionConversation`, `Markdown`, `OpenGeniLinkProvider`) instead of rendering console paths that 404 on the host origin. Invalid reserved references render unavailable. `parseOpenGeniLink` in `@opengeni/sdk` classifies the same hrefs for non-React clients and preserves validated console return hints. Editable-artifact export uses configured exporter capabilities and preflights the exact format and options before creating a snapshot or pinning a version. Stock deployments serve spreadsheet XLSX; the artifact Skills stop promising unsupported PDF/DOCX/PPTX exports.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 3f9c757: Another member's private session is now indistinguishable from a missing one
  on every session route. Request-facing session authorization refuses a target
  the caller cannot see (including one that does not exist) as `404` before the
  route runs, instead of letting routes such as `GET .../queue`,
  `GET|PUT .../composer-draft`, `POST .../events` and `POST .../control` fail
  with a retryable `500` on the absent row. A missing session is now refused
  before request-body validation.
- 2088678: Support an optional exact email allowlist for native human account admission.
- 57f030c: Retain failed scheduled occurrences when connection-account selection blocks
  dispatch. Run history includes structured connector/account identifiers and
  safe eligibility reasons without credential values or raw error messages.
  Replaying an occurrence retains its original outcome without admitting work.
- 3f9c757: Scheduled tasks created by an organization or workspace API key (or the
  configured key) are now ownerless service schedules and run. Previously the
  key subject became the schedule's immutable owner, and every occurrence failed
  invisibly in the scheduler. An occurrence refused because its frozen authority
  cannot be proven is now recorded as a failed run with error
  `scheduled_authority_unavailable` instead of being retried to exhaustion with
  no run.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled run whose turn waits for a tool approval or a structured question
  is now visible: `ScheduledTaskRun.awaitingHuman` (`{ since, expiresAt }`) on run
  listings and `awaitingHuman` on the scheduled-task attention list, instead of the
  run looking merely "dispatched". The new optional
  `agentConfig.approvalTimeoutSeconds` (60 s to 30 days; default none) lets the
  scheduler reject the pending approval (or skip the question) as a labelled
  system decision once nobody answered in time, driven by a durable workflow
  timer.
- 11151c6: Support a lossless scheduled-task model and reasoning patch through MCP, HTTP and the SDK. Preserve unrelated stored configuration and existing-session settings, keep normal authority validation, and reject concurrent execution-config changes instead of overwriting them.
- 95c700a: Saving a session's connector selection no longer fails with `422 first-party MCP tool is disabled by deployment policy` when the session's stored tool catalog still names a first-party tool the deployment has since disallowed. The update now drops those tools, matching what the runtime already does, instead of blocking unrelated connector toggles.
- c823664: New scheduled tasks and new web sessions now pick up the workspace default Sandbox Environment and the default Variable Sets it carries. A scheduled task that omits `rigId` stores the workspace default at creation, the way session create resolves it (an existing-session task keeps its target session's environment, a Connected Machine task stores none, and `null` still opts out); a later change to the workspace default does not move an existing task. Binding an environment to a task's generated sessions, whether by default, by an explicit `rigId` on create or edit, or by switching an existing-session task to generated sessions, now requires permission to attach that environment's default Variable Sets, as session create already did. In a workspace with a default, a Sandbox Environment picked in the composer applies to that session only and is no longer carried into the next new-session form, so later sessions return to the workspace default.

### Patch Changes

- 3aab8f9: Allow a single MCP provider to use the existing aggregate tool-count allowance instead of dropping otherwise bounded catalogs above 1,000 tools. Align permissions discovery and explicit tool selections with the same allowance. Preserve definition, response, per-provider and aggregate byte limits and shared count accounting.

### Patch Changes

- 6eb431b: Allow authenticated hosts to replace an existing session MCP attachment with an accessible native connection through the standalone credential rotation API. An optional explicit replacement URL must match the native account's stored destination while the old URL remains a compare-and-set precondition. Preserve resource restrictions, version fencing, quiescence and idempotent receipts without replacing session history or accepted-attempt identity.
- a307c83: Remove inherited account selections for integrations removed from a scheduled task. Retained integrations keep their exact accounts, and explicitly supplied selections still undergo normal validation.
- f2ee81e: Count the one-time verified-signup trial grant as OpenGeni credits when resolving the default model for new work. Any positive credit balance now selects the configured credits default (after a saved workspace default or a connected subscription), and a balance at or below zero falls back to the deployment default.

- a11d810: Allow Codex catalog entries to retire from new selection while retaining exact already-accepted execution under unchanged live authorization checks.
- b1ad0c6: Start Slack tasks with the initiating user's saved website repositories, variable sets, compute and tool selections in the destination workspace. Preserve draft content, explicit empty tools, and ordinary resource authorization.
- 5fbb333: Freeze follow-up connector accounts against a workspace-default session's effective tool list. A session that tracks workspace defaults stores only its creation-time snapshot, so account selections for a connector enabled later were rejected as unmatched and its personal delegation was never frozen.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

### Minor Changes

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.
- 132b945: Add organization-owned integration acquisition policy with a discoverable catalog,
  revisioned administration API and SDK, and organization settings. Enforce selected
  provider and custom-protocol permissions on supported setup and installation paths
  at preparation and persistence boundaries.

  Preserve ordinary ownership and authorization, exact completed-request replay,
  unchanged reconciliation, cancellation and other reducing operations. Existing
  connection execution and credential refresh are not revoked by this policy.
  Deployment-configured tools and embedding-host session-local MCP configuration
  retain their existing admission rules; this is not a network or execution allowlist.

  Apply the organization integration policy migration and matching role provisioning
  with the matching runtime before enabling the setting. Older runtimes do not enforce
  the new acquisition policy. See `docs/organization-integration-policy.md` for the
  administration, identity, persistence and recovery contract.

- 7e2436a: Keep ordinary chat attachments out of Knowledge unless selected as useful evidence or a reusable reference. Distinguish supporting evidence from discoverable references, preserve exact originals and revisions, and add read-only collection and duplicate discovery before saving. Includes maintenance migration 0469; old runtimes must be drained before activation.

### Patch Changes

- b1adc9f: Recover missing OAuth metadata for existing custom native connections. Resolve connector readiness through accepted account routes, and distinguish unavailable execution tools from a missing account selection instead of requesting unnecessary reconnection.
- 1c924ed: Add authorized, resumable literal search of saved user and completed assistant
  messages, including unloaded history. Workspace search can return one
  representative match per session; in-session Find returns every occurrence with
  stable event identity and original-text UTF-16 offsets. Requests and browser
  result batches remain bounded, with explicit continuation and provisional counts.

  Expose bounded exact-sequence history navigation and message highlighting for
  React hosts. The web console connects a contextual session-search dialog to
  full-history Find, preserves search state across navigation, and keeps ended
  conversations readable. Tool output, reasoning and unfinished delta-only
  assistant messages are outside the initial searchable scope. Exact Markdown
  matches use a labeled source excerpt that stays in place when Find closes;
  readers can explicitly restore the formatted message.

- c31a951: Add connection-bound MCP tool permission discovery and Allow/Ask/Block management through the existing approval ledger, enforced consistently for direct tools and Codemode.

  Let workspace-default sessions inherit newly connected apps while retaining per-session connector exclusions and exact explicit selections. Present connected apps, logos, health, and reconnection in the composer connector menu. Keep internal runtime controls out of workspace settings and use Capabilities consistently in settings navigation.

- f90d628: Add explicit managed-human consent for same-session singleton Modal recovery from
  an exact older CURRENT checkpoint. Protect membership, route and artifact identity,
  retain durable replay receipts and generation provenance, and reconstruct a model
  warning before later inference. Separate consent from verified restoration and
  never replay failed commands. Refuse Retry on an unchanged blocked effective route
  without blocking an independently selected Connected Machine. Additive migration
  0495 keeps consent DB-disabled until operator-verified compatible rollout; permanent
  consent receipts reject old inference claims even after disabling consent or lease
  replacement. Only the warning-aware worker declares the scoped protocol.
  Preserve explicit failed-turn Retry after verified recovery or Connected Machine
  selection, and retain consent identity when post-accept status reads lose access.
  Keep fresh migration-before-role-provisioning and later runtime-role provisioning
  safe, with SELECT-only rollout access and owner-only activation.
- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- aa09567: Preserve explicit host MCP delegation selections through durable composer Send and Steer admission, including exact retries after an uncertain response. Keep existing owner, generation, visibility, revocation and replay checks; omitted selections do not inherit authority.
- 3fa175e: Provide bundled OpenGeni product help with official documentation links,
  integration and billing boundaries, and dependency recovery guidance. Hosts can
  exclude it with the existing bundledSkillIds selection, including an empty list
  for embedded agents. Update the canonical integration guide.
- 9d9b94b: Keep the published dependency closure aligned with the updated plugin removal
  contracts. The SDK exposes named removal outcomes and optional preview-token
  confirmation alongside the existing installation-version check.
- d9190f7: Use an existing target session's persisted MCP configuration when admitting scheduled host-tool authority. Preserve exact destination matching and accepted-attempt delegation checks without inheriting authority from ordinary inline credentials.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- d3672c0: Measure workspace capture gate waits on every routed sandbox operation, including
  mid-turn and API-direct operations, without changing provider-call accounting or
  admission guarantees. Record physical warm capture and publication duration at
  actual settlement, including captures that outlive the initiating caller.
- f7c9169: Support verified-email Google and GitHub sign-in linking and personal sign-in
  method management. Preserve canonical user ownership and email-verification
  checks, require recent authentication for sensitive changes, prevent removal of
  the last usable method, and respect explicit provider disconnection until a
  verified reconnect. Surface actionable callback feedback and security
  notification outcomes without granting integration access.
- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- de5569f: Allow native full organization API keys to administer host MCP resolver registrations. Align request authorization, live-key revalidation, and the database write trigger with the public key contract without granting human organization-admin permissions. Read-only, workspace-scoped, delegated, external-user, expired, and revoked credentials remain denied.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Minor Changes

- ad9dc2f: Add a non-provisioning external identity lookup and opt-in, operation-keyed service workspace onboarding. Cancellation-bearing revocation reuses native membership teardown and the organization-workspace receipt ledger to fence a delayed grant, including when no membership exists yet. Legacy unkeyed onboarding remains unchanged and cannot be fenced retroactively.
- da4a85f: Add native organization-admin MCP credential resolver registration by stable workspace externalSource. Support encrypted, idempotent generation-checked endpoint/secret rotation and revocation with fail-closed namespace routing and live physical-use fencing. Existing accepted participant, schedule and child authority remains unchanged. Migration 0463 requires maintenance and matching API/worker binaries.

### Patch Changes

- 50ac837: Add explicit accepted-turn host binding selection for shared conversations. Capture each participant's exact owner delegation without changing the configured destination or borrowing creator credentials, preserve fixed bindings and scheduled/child live authority checks, and apply session-local server configuration to follow-up selection. Document the supported empty-session then first-text admission flow.

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 935af4e: Add an authorized standalone session inline MCP credential rotation operation with durable idempotent receipts, exact destination and credential-version fencing, and atomic quiescence checks. Expose the operation through HTTP and the SDK without sending messages, scheduling work, retrying external mutations, or widening connection or attempt authority. Keep existing message-bound credential updates unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [be17b8e]
  - @opengeni/runtime@2.5.1

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Use authenticated canonical users instead of session end-user labels. Session
  creation rejects caller-supplied identity scope; list filters use scopeSubjectId.
  Chat user mode uses asUser and explicit workspace membership, while collaborators
  address the same session ID. Reopen legacy user-namespaced chats by session ID.

  Retire active session Memory in favor of task notes. Historical session Memory
  remains stored and old selectors hydrate as off, never workspace. User Memory
  uses the verified active-turn user. Preserve frozen scheduled agent-reach policy.
  Migration 0457 requires the documented maintenance cutover and matching writers.

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

## 2.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 392c575: Retain Modal command handles, provider execution identities, output, and exact exit status across provider-client reconstruction. Persist stream pages before acknowledging their cursors, and treat unavailable historical locators as unknown rather than proof of process loss. Execution status is provider-owned and never read from sandbox-writable files.
- 9827c25: Add message action slots and an optional source message boundary for managed-human forks. The web UI places turn feedback and Fork from here beside Copy and the timestamp. Message forks preserve existing authorization and idempotency, copy only the selected canonical history prefix, and reject ambiguous, compacted, or incomplete boundaries.

  Migration 0429 requires draining the API and both worker pools and provisioning the updated runtime routine contract before starting the new binary.

- c915b0f: Remove the separate `@opengeni/react/chat` component. Use the existing
  `SessionConversation` or compose the timeline and composer for the full agent
  experience. The server-side `@opengeni/sdk/chat` wrapper and adapters remain
  unchanged; their protocol requires a custom or compatible frontend.
- 14dd6fe: Add workspace transcription provider preferences and optional fallback after explicit rejection, preserving recording pins after uncertain or successful attempts. Refresh expired SuperGrok credentials and recover the provider's invalid-credential 403 response.
- f04243d: Preserve durable wake acknowledgment receipts through API and worker signalers. Report pending admission and unconfirmed legacy signal delivery separately from acknowledged revisions, so transport acceptance cannot be mistaken for agent execution progress. Existing wake retries and admission fences remain authoritative.

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4536385: Expose independently configurable GitHub action approval policies for routine writes, review submission, and pull-request merges, while preserving capability-first defaults, explicit policies, and attempt-frozen execution authority.
- 0c39126: Add per-connection turn-model permissions and organization workspace assignment
  for subscriptions and model gateways. Migration 0424 requires draining APIs and
  workers; do not restart older workers after policies are enabled.

  Fix organization Codex sign-in in local mode without granting managed-human reset-credit ownership to the local administrator.

- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- 0a81cc8: Add durable workspace pause/resume timers with duration controls, countdowns,
  manual cancellation, and idempotent worker execution. Migration 0420 requires a
  maintenance deployment: drain old writers and deploy matching API/workers.

### Patch Changes

- 582dc62: Inherit only repository resources when spawning child sessions. File attachments now require explicit selection; document this in the session creation tool.
- c90f3fc: Make workspace tool and plugin defaults independently inheritable. Add explicit reset patches, preserve existing custom lists, and prevent unrelated plugin saves from freezing built-in defaults. Show inherited/custom mode and partial group counts, with deliberate customization and inspectable individual tools.
- 414946c: Inherit model, effort and speed from the latest started turn for follow-ups and voice handoffs. Project the same policy in session reads, fresh drafts and Insights without changing accepted turns or stored creation settings.
- 7772511: Let verified Personal workspace owners manage preferences, model configuration,
  runtime controls, and instruction/Skill autonomy without granting membership or
  API-key delegation powers.
- 6de9fe3: Preserve newer composer draft content and project provenance when a stale realtime create records selection history, while exposing optional project provenance consistently across contracts and SDK types. Store project provenance in rolling-upgrade-safe additive draft columns behind a metadata fence, concurrent partial index, bounded resumable backfill, and separately committed validation; dual-write mixed-version draft writers without holding schema locks across legacy-row scans. Avoid passive hydration autosaves and honor the latest route launch intent when hydration completes.
- 2fb17fd: Track published Site session origin automatically; add origin-filtered session
  listing and skill defaults for reusable in-Site conversations. Site provenance
  remains independent of project placement and session authorization.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.
- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 699477a: Restore autonomous agent Workspace Memory writes whenever workspace Memory is enabled. Agents can save and correct active facts, decisions, incidents, fixes, and outcomes independently of Learning mode while all existing Memory kinds remain retrieval-only through search. Autonomous learning may activate eligible concise Workspace instructions and focused Skills through their governed, auditable, undoable lifecycles; Review first keeps proposals inactive and Off creates no derived change.
- ddce5cc: Allow scheduled generated sessions and nested workers to target an exact Connected Machine, and fail closed without leaving an unstarted generated session behind when that route cannot be established.
- 132c8d3: Require self-hosted-only session defaults to resolve to a reachable Connected Machine. Keep the composer blocked when no eligible machine exists instead of submitting an unroutable session.
- 88b6b48: Share Variable Set reserved-name validation between the API and web UI, and make Variable Set editing and variable management clearer and more actionable.

### Patch Changes

- 92f227f: Make session and workspace Pause/Resume desired-state mutations report authoritative changed, unchanged, and replayed outcomes. Represented no-ops no longer allocate control revisions, events, interruptions, or wakes, while newer descendant overrides and missing lifecycle repairs still produce real mutations. First-party MCP session control now returns the same versioned mutation receipt for agent-bound and sessionless callers.

Keep bring-your-own GitHub App, GitLab, and Azure DevOps registration as the provider-neutral advanced path.
- 5d4edd4: Add a public atomic composer application command shared by HTTP and in-process hosts, including atomic host-authorized resource augmentation without a trusted draft rewrite; add a receiver-safe narrow React session client constructor with host submit overrides and draft projection; and add presentation-only file-node filtering across the packaged workbench surfaces.
- 986f5fe: Add provider-neutral browser login session sets with bounded independently revocable slots, explicit actor switching, isolated add and re-authentication, scoped logout, non-enumerating cross-slot deep-link recovery, and rolling legacy/dual/broker compatibility.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f30555c: Add atomic same-workspace session forks with an explicit private or workspace destination. Private-to-workspace copies require a durable acknowledgement, workspace members may fork a shared source into fresh authority of their own, and private sources remain owner-only. Exact applied receipts remain recoverable by the same live workspace actor after mutable source authority changes, while changed requests conflict and fresh keys still require current source authority. Every fork receives fresh authority, provenance, root, and sandbox-group identity without inheriting live grants, credentials, Connections, turns, goals, MCP, resource attachments, processes, or pins. The managed web control now exposes the generic Fork dialog to authorized shared-session members and verifies the returned owned destination before navigation.
- 47ccfab: Workspaces can persist exact default MCP servers and first-party OpenGeni tools for new sessions. Session creation, workspace-default policy updates, and scheduled session creation apply that policy while preserving the previous deployment defaults for workspaces without an override.
- b74e557: Add an explicit, replay-safe Document authority-reclassification lifecycle and
  a resumable organization Default-collection backfill. Reclassification requires
  the exact expected authority tuple, updates the Document and every chunk in one
  transaction, and retains immutable before/after receipts. The SDK and API expose
  the account-admin and actor-fenced operations, bounded cursor-paginated receipt
  history, and same-organization portable-personal behavior without making
  collections an authority boundary.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: `requireSessionAuthorization` denies `session.approval.write` to every agent attempt on every surface: tool approvals stay human-only, while structured human input (`session.human_input.write`) remains answerable by a live attempt. The React queue chrome and timeline label the new child lifecycle notice kinds (`child_requires_action`, `child_requires_action_resolved`, `child_paused`, `child_waiting_capacity`, `child_progress`) instead of dropping them.
- de3f376: Bound and shape the durable text an agent authors on a user's behalf. The budget
  follows the destination, on every agent surface that reaches it. A mandatory
  workspace rule is composed verbatim into the prompt of every session it applies
  to, so `remember`, `instruction_policy_propose`, and `task_note_promote_instruction_policy`
  are all capped at 600 characters; the preference destination is capped at 1,200
  across its three surfaces, because only its short descriptor is composed and the
  content is retrieved on demand. Task-note promotion is checked in the database
  layer, where the content is the note rather than a request field, and is rejected
  rather than truncated before any evidence, claim, or proposal row is written.
  `company_profile_propose`, the largest always-on surface, is capped for agents at
  400 characters per scalar, 200 per list entry, and 4,096 UTF-8 bytes total. The
  Knowledge lane keeps its 4,000-character retrieval-evidence ceiling, and every
  human editor limit is unchanged so nothing a person already typed becomes
  invalid. Tool descriptions now state the prompt cost and the authoring shape, and
  the `remember` confirmation card names the character count and destination so a
  human can judge the cost before saving. Existing stored revisions are never
  rewritten.
- 0b3b8df: Add an explicit organization-owner-confirmed agent path for company-profile and
  strategic-goal administration. The two-step MCP flow stages an immutable inactive
  full-profile proposal, binds activation to the initiating human's exact
  structured confirmation, revalidates current organization authority and profile
  CAS in PostgreSQL under the canonical workspace/session lock order, and remains
  independent of workspace learning mode. The manual `account:admin` route keeps
  its admission contract, and the earlier proposal-only `company_profile_propose`
  tool (`durable_learning` provenance) is retired in favor of this path.
- bbd19e0: Add an owner/admin organization setting that enables Only-me chats in shared
  workspaces for organizations holding the session-tenancy readiness receipt
  (`GET`/`PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/private-session-settings`,
  `@opengeni/sdk/organization-private-session-settings`, and the organization
  settings page). Already activated organizations are backfilled enabled.

### Patch Changes

- 72f8fc6: Add GitHub App repository-binding resolution for bare `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` resources: parse coordinates, list the workspace's auditable installation allowlists under RLS, and stamp `githubInstallationId`/`githubRepositoryId` only when exactly one bound allowlist holds the repository id reported through an injected provider lookup. Unbound, non-allowlisted, ambiguous, and unavailable outcomes leave the resource bare and are reported so callers can warn without failing.
- 45bffc3: Return empty personal-resource authority pages before session-tenancy activation while keeping mutations and runtime use activation-gated. Allow managed humans to read their personal Rig catalog without granting Rig administration.

### Patch Changes

- b2dd2f7: Bound the remaining request-scoped workspace control-row mutations and make the lock budget a first-class setting: `updateWorkspaceSettings`, `deleteSessionTreeIfQuiescent`, queue move/edit/delete, composer draft save, and the MCP agent message accept an optional `controlLockTimeoutMs` that API routes and core commands pass (lifecycle callers keep the unbounded wait), so a busy workspace yields the same typed retryable 503 `WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`. `OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` is now parsed and validated once at boot by `@opengeni/config` (`workspaceControlLockTimeoutMs`, positive integer ms, default 20000), installed into `@opengeni/db` by `createApp` through `configureWorkspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs`, and rendered by the deployment runtime-env generator as an optional passthrough.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- fba437f: Resolve a managed human's personal-workspace authority in the connection grant layer on top of the session-surface prerequisite's canonical workspace-authority resolver.

  A managed human's personal workspace deliberately has no `workspace_memberships` row (migration 0219 raises on one); the owner's access is the `organization_memberships.personal_workspace_id` pointer. `getWorkspaceGrant` is a bare membership join, so every seam using it as a "does this subject still hold workspace authority here" predicate denied the one human who always belongs. In their own personal workspace, `freezePersonalConnectionDelegations` returned no delegations at all and Google Drive publication resolved no target. Those seams now use the pointer-aware resolver.

  The landed session-surface prerequisite renamed the public database oracle to `namedSubjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority`, extracted the canonical in-scope authority rule, and declared the one required `@opengeni/db` major. This change consumes that landed API rather than declaring the same database break again. The named-subject wrapper continues to restore the caller's prior `opengeni.subject_id`; calling it on a transaction handle must never redefine who the rest of that transaction runs as.

  **BREAKING (`@opengeni/core`):** `PersonalConnectionDelegationSource`'s `subject` variant now requires `accountId` — the personal-workspace pointer lives on an organization membership, so the account is part of the question. `personalConnectionDelegationSourceForGrant` supplies it.

  **BREAKING behaviour change (`@opengeni/core`):** a delegated/bearer grant (`metadata.delegated === true`) now yields no personal-connection delegations **in any workspace**, including ordinary shared workspaces where it previously worked through a real membership row. A delegated payload's `subjectId` and `workspaceId` are signed token fields with no database row behind them, so treating that subject as authority to borrow a user's private provider credentials is not a boundary worth holding — in a shared workspace any more than a personal one. Embedding hosts minting user-facing delegated tokens lose personal X/Reddit/Atlassian/Google Drive delegation for those sessions; workspace-owned connections are unaffected. See `docs/embedding.md`.

### Minor Changes

- 3e1ad07: Add turn-atomic personal Variable Set and Rig attachments for create, Send, and
  Steer, including logical-turn once receipts, recovery-safe snapshots, warning
  acknowledgement, and SDK contracts.
- dc8c73f: Add professional organization administration with canonical rename and a
  Personal-safe shared-workspace access inventory, explicit Organization /
  Workspace / Only-me scope at Rig and Variable Set creation, and activation-gated
  atomic private visibility when creating sessions.
- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- f7497fd: Add a disabled-by-default, user-owned personal GitHub OAuth lifecycle with
  separate deployment credentials, signed PKCE state, encrypted token custody,
  verified GitHub identity, typed SDK routes, reconnect fencing, and idempotent
  disconnect.
- ba0be3d: Add activation-gated owner management for personal-resource session and standing grants, with kind-derived actions and permissions, exact session authority epochs, route-workspace-fenced revocation, RFC3339 lifecycle timestamps, bounded keyset pages, complete credential-free delegation receipts, FORCE-RLS-safe expiry and invalid-action settlement, and SDK methods that intentionally exclude standalone `once` and custom expiry.
- c7cafb1: Activate owner-only session visibility changes and same-workspace private forks
  through the public API and SDK after per-organization tenancy activation.

  Expose activation-gated session tenancy metadata, typed quiescence and
  idempotency conflicts, exact durable event fanout, and explicit retry fences.

### Patch Changes

- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- 3825727: Normalize legacy or malformed workspace-membership permissions before member listing and authorization, without restoring any obsolete authority.
- 9530e19: Let a managed human use the session surface inside their own personal workspace, without widening the owner-only exception to anyone else.

  A managed human's personal workspace deliberately has no `workspace_memberships` row (migration 0219 raises on one) — their access is the `organization_memberships.personal_workspace_id` pointer. Three session seams fenced on a bare membership probe and therefore denied the one human who always belongs: `GET /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions` returned **403** so the workspace looked empty, `PUT …/sessions/:id/pin` returned **403**, and `PUT …/new-session-draft` returned **403**.

  `subjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthorityInScope` (`packages/db/src/workspace-authority.ts`) is now the single implementation of the corrected rule. It refuses to set `opengeni.subject_id`, which makes the arbitrary-subject oracle shape unrepresentable at these seams and keeps the authority read inside the caller's transaction and advisory fence.

  **The authorization is not that resolver.** Neither it nor the exported `namedSubjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority` establishes who the caller is — both answer "does subject X hold authority here". The one thing that authorizes the exception is `AccessGrantAuthorization.canonicalManagedHumanSession`, stamped only inside the branch of `resolveAccessContext` that verified a Better Auth cookie. Inspecting the grant would not do: a delegated bearer chooses its own `principalKind`, `metadata.delegated`, `serviceInitiator`, and `subjectId`. Bearer/delegated principals, API keys, service initiators, same-organization co-members, organization admins and owners, and account administrators all fail closed, as does any authentication path added later.

  The public helper is renamed `subjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority` → `namedSubjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority`, and it now restores `opengeni.subject_id` after probing (`withRlsContext` restores account/workspace but not subject, so the probed subject leaked out of the savepoint). This changeset declares the required `@opengeni/db` **major** at the first PR that lands the breaking rename; the companion connection-authority change retains its own `@opengeni/core` major for its separate public break.

- d8ba09d: Make private children inherit their parent's visibility through an exact live-attempt capability, expose effective tool policy in session monitoring, keep late child results from restarting settled parents, and preserve private-owner authority on internal-update turns.
- 48b9f09: Allow organization administrators to invite an email before registration, bind
  the invitation only after exact Better Auth email verification, and apply its
  initial shared-workspace access when the invited user joins without creating a
  redundant fallback organization.
- 3b6b30e: Make the workspace control prefix fair and bounded: `lockWorkspaceInferenceControl` takes a FIFO transaction advisory lock before the row lock so Pause/Resume cannot be starved by continuous shared claim/settlement/append traffic, Send/Steer/queued Steer/realtime sync hold the prefix shared while the target branch is active and escalate through a savepoint only for a paused branch, and request-scoped API mutations fail with a typed retryable `WorkspaceControlBusyError` (HTTP 503) instead of parking a pooled connection and snapshot when the prefix stays busy.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c78ed0: Separate new-session and established-session composer policy authority. Exact draft submission now atomically freezes queued-turn text, resources, model, reasoning, and latency, then rotates the server draft; queue Edit restores that exact snapshot and stale revisions surface as conflicts instead of silent rebases.

### Patch Changes

- a7df809: Harden the four `remember` instruction-policy edges.

  A moved policy head is now one typed, actionable `RememberError` (`baseline_stale`) on both the propose and confirm sides instead of an untyped error or a raw SQLSTATE 40001. The activation baseline no longer contributes to operation identity, so an ordinary turn-recovery replay of the same `operationId` stays idempotent across a head change; staleness is still enforced by the compare-and-set and by the activation function. A governed write that fails now archives the evidence task note it created instead of stranding it.

  A confirmation stranded by a head that moved after the human already answered now rebaselines onto the current head and completes, instead of hard-failing and forcing the human to answer again. Proposal uniqueness moves from one-per-source to one-per-source-per-baseline to admit that successor; the successor reuses the same knowledge proposal, so the human's confirmation stays bound to exactly the content they approved.

  Two consequences worth stating plainly:

  - Activating a rule replaces the whole active policy document, so confirming a second rule discards a first rule that a human also approved, without asking again. That is the existing whole-document-replacement design of this lane rather than something the rebaseline introduces - previously the stale baseline forced a round trip that would have clobbered anyway - and the audit trail stays exact, with the activation event naming the revision it replaced and `undo` restoring it. The rebaseline removes the round trip, which makes the behaviour easier to reach.
  - Excluding the baseline from operation identity changes both the proposal request fingerprint and the governed-write input hash (which derives the service actor subject id). A `remember` operation that durably wrote rows under the previous release and is replayed under this one computes a different identity and fails as an operation-reuse conflict. This is bounded to operations in flight across the deploy and self-heals with a fresh operation id; no dual-identity compatibility path was added.

- 6d22ab5: Widen the task-note expiry ceiling from 30 to 90 days. Task notes are pure agent-to-agent coordination within one root session tree; resuming a paused root session/task tree after a longer gap previously lost all coordination notes silently. `TASK_NOTE_MAX_LIFETIME_DAYS` is now the single source of truth, referenced by the application-layer bound checks and `remember`'s evidence note instead of a hardcoded literal. Fully backward compatible: every existing row and every caller supplying 1-30 days keeps working unchanged.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c2d958: Google Drive publication freezes its exact output destination on the accepted delegation, so a later connection-settings change fails an already-accepted turn's publication closed instead of silently redirecting it. Every publication sits behind exactly one durable execute-once connector fence (the attempt connector-action wrapper for model callers, the tool's own registration for Codemode callers): a failure before the first mutating provider request settles not_executed with a retry-safe message, while a failure after it settles uncertain and surfaces the unknown outcome.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ca75ed9: Add the governed-learning activation controller with exact authority revalidation, destination-native workspace activation, immutable content-free receipts, and supersession-safe append-only undo.
- c297fc0: Route derived Company Brain proposals through the immutable workspace learning-policy snapshot before destination admission.
  Add exact rooted Task-note to proposed workspace Knowledge promotion with immutable value-free provenance and replay-safe MCP tools.
  Add atomic Task-note correction/revert with immutable old/new lineage, strict attempt/version fencing, and replay-safe first-party tooling.
- db758f3: Publish governed-learning activations and undos to the configured workspace Slack channel through the existing durable publication outbox. The dead durable-learning adapter (`publishDurableLearningOutcomeToSlack`) is replaced by `publishGovernedLearningEventToSlack`, which projects only content-free receipt facts, uses `governed-learning:<event>:<receiptId>` idempotency, and fails closed for Slack-derived evidence.
- e9aabaa: Wire the governed-learning evaluator and activation controller into the Company Brain learning-policy router. Ways-of-working proposals now record a content-free decision receipt after they commit; under `automatic`, an eligible preference decision is activated through the destination lifecycle (instruction policy keeps a human activation boundary). The route receipt gains `learning`, `learningFailure`, and activation receipt/destination facts; `activation.activated` is no longer always `false`.
- c297fc0: Add atomic rooted Task-note promotion into inactive instruction-policy and
  preference proposals while preserving exact source evidence, replay identity,
  and human-only activation.
- 22c0c21: Add the managed-human organization invitation, role, suspension, offboarding,
  and retention lifecycle with revision-fenced APIs and SDK methods. Self
  invitation history is exposed only through bounded keyset pages, and acceptance
  resolves one exact subject-bound invitation. Already-open session,
  workspace-control, live, and interaction streams periodically recheck current
  membership authority and close after revocation. A bounded operator command
  commits expired offboarded personal database deletion together with a closed,
  exact-key cleanup-obligation set before deleting external objects. Provider
  failures retry only unfinished obligations, retained references abort before
  external bytes are touched, File bucket identity stays frozen across retries,
  and immutable lifecycle evidence survives cleanup.
- 4eb7abd: `remember` with `lane: knowledge` now returns `confirmation_required` bound to the Knowledge claim, and `remember_confirm` (`claimId`) approves the claim through the Knowledge review lifecycle after the exact initiating human answered the bound canonical question with `save` (rolling migration 0274, `confirm_remember_knowledge_claim`, immutable `remember_knowledge_confirmation_receipts`). `remember_confirm` accepts either `proposalId` + `decisionReceiptId` (preference / instruction policy) or `claimId` (knowledge); the confirm receipt carries `claimId` and a `knowledge` activation summary with `undo: knowledge_review`.
- 89d4ab3: Add the explicit user-directed `remember` / `remember_confirm` agent tools. Content becomes exact task-note evidence promoted through the learning-policy router; a preference activates immediately under `automatic`, Knowledge stays proposal-only, and everything else returns a bound `request_human_input` payload whose `save` answer authorizes activation through the new rolling migration 0272 `activate_human_confirmed_learning_decision` capability (`authority_kind = human_confirmed`, human-input request id recorded on the receipt).
- 30ba620: Make every accepted scheduled agent occurrence an immutable, credential-free
  execution snapshot bound to one run, session, scheduled update, logical turn,
  and attempt chain. Agent tasks accept explicit `connectionAuthorities`
  (omitted preserves, `[]` clears, an array replaces), execution-affecting edits
  require the same causal human, `once` grants are consumed exactly once per
  run, cold reusable sessions converge on one revision-bound materialization
  receipt, and task deletion becomes a one-way paused tombstone with durable
  connector cleanup. Create/update requests are byte-bounded at ingress while
  stored rows stay readable. Migration `0275` is a maintenance cutover.
- f72563d: Slack now has exactly two authorities: the personal hosted Slack MCP grant and the OpenGeni workspace bot. The workspace-owned hosted Slack MCP connection is removed: OAuth start, reconnect, the callback fence, and capability enablement reject an explicit non-personal ownership for `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`, an omitted ownership on that resource defaults to personal, and `listEnabledMcpCapabilityServers` no longer runs a workspace-scoped Slack MCP installation enabled by an earlier release. The bot manifest and canonical bot allowlist gain the bot-token Real-time Search scopes `search:read.public`, `search:read.files`, and `search:read.users` as requested-but-not-required extras; apply them to the Slack app before deploying, since the install URL requests every requested scope. The bot search tool itself is a separate change.
- c297fc0: Add deterministic governed-learning evaluation over exact accepted policy and evidence authority, with immutable content-free decision receipts and no activation capability.
- cac85bc: Every persistable /workspace writer admission and retained process now freezes its exact authority tuple (causal initiator, initiating human, organization-membership grant identity with observed revision, and session tenancy epoch/visibility/owner). Direct and process actors are fenced like turns: a revoked or suspended grant, or an unattributed pre-0277 tenancy half, fails a new mutation closed before any workspace generation is consumed, and the running provider process is never terminated or re-owned.

### Patch Changes

- 987742d: Skip the redundant in-box rig marker probe when a live Modal session reports
  the exact immutable image that already passed the rig's content, source,
  provider-binding, and independent cold-boot verification. Missing or mismatched
  image identity retains the existing fail-closed marker and setup path.
- 987742d: Reduce turn-start overhead without reducing admitted history, rig variables, or
  user-visible content. Active history loads in one admitted query, automatic
  compaction skips duplicate history work below threshold, unchanged Codex
  credential pointers avoid redundant session-activity writes, rig defaults
  load at bounded concurrency for admitted worker attempts, and the attempt-scoped
  MCP wrapper no longer reuses a broader process-global tool list.

  Improve large-session interaction by measuring rich-message disclosure without
  a second React commit, showing truthful pending queue actions immediately, and
  replacing the false zero-step placeholder with the session's real lifecycle.

- 5cd7b46: `remember` with `lane: instruction_policy` now binds the draft to the target's current activation baseline (active head revision and CAS version, including a deactivated-to-null boundary) instead of assuming an empty workspace, so a user-directed rule can be proposed and confirmed in a workspace that already has an active policy.
- 6860c5f: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private scopes for Rigs and Connected Machines. Personal machine use and Rig materialization now revalidate exact-attempt grants, membership, workspace access, authority epochs, and generations before runtime access.
- c297fc0: Complete governed goal rewrites with strict agent change metadata, immutable
  proposal rejection and CAS-fenced rollback, bounded revision pagination, and
  accepted-turn root constraints that child agents may inherit or narrow. The
  original raw-array goal-revision list remains unchanged; bounded pagination is
  available through a separately named API and SDK surface.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

### Minor Changes

- eeb7cb6: Add immutable personal/workspace connection authority contracts and immediate
  pre-use revalidation helpers.

### Patch Changes

- 90c0c3e: Persist bounded, content-free Company Brain prompt contribution estimates on authoritative model-call facts and expose their source breakdown and coverage in Workspace Insights.
- e0e0102: Unify browser, computer, identity, realtime, and Codemode behavior across managed sandboxes and connected machines.
- 4d1ed07: Preserve complete bounded lazy-search tool schemas across durable model history, expose Linux desktop application launch when the image supports it, suppress the managed Chrome sandbox warning, label Computer sessions as Desktops in the UI, and keep AnyDoc available in headed desktop sandboxes.
- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- d2f172c: Add fail-closed, metadata-only capability, exact rig-version health, exact alert-selector data-source checks, and source/claim authority fencing for scheduled incident telemetry responders before expensive retrieval.
- 04b1a1f: Add exact-attempt, workspace-local governed Knowledge proposal/correction
  routing and inactive instruction-policy and preference proposal adapters while
  preserving human activation authority and immutable Knowledge provenance.

### Major Changes

- 083387e: Replace the removed per-turn `turnInstructions` system-prefix contract with generic per-message `modelContext` content. This is a breaking release-train cutover: old mutating clients are rejected after migration 0240. Context now enters canonical user history without standard timeline rendering, preserves the persistent prompt-cache prefix, and works across initial, queued, steer, realtime delegation, and transcript handoff paths.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- d2def0c: Add the complete browser-native and semantic computer interaction system across managed sandboxes, Connected Machines, attached Chrome, and external browser placements. Ship durable browser identities, authentication repair, network routing, downloads/uploads, shared causal control, public SDK and React workbench surfaces, and one exact MCP/Codemode execution catalog with native Connected Machine access.
- 5215c0e: Add the first-party Fiken connector: a registered-app OAuth flow (`startFikenOAuth` + public callback, Basic-auth code exchange, broker-owned refresh with rotating refresh tokens) and a verified paste-a-token install route, both storing one workspace-owned `fiken.no` connection; explicit-only `fiken_*` first-party MCP tools (reads plus contact-create and idempotent invoice-draft-create); a serialized single-concurrent-request Fiken client; an `api:fiken` capability tile whose connect sheet leads with OAuth and folds the token form behind a toggle; and operator config `OPENGENI_FIKEN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- aeb07f4: Add durable workspace decision publication to verified Slack bot channels with immutable configuration revisions, outbox attempts and receipts, bounded retries and terminal states, admin review/history UX, typed SDK methods, and a post-persistence governed-learning outcome adapter.

### Patch Changes

- 87e9ae6: Add durable Google Drive Changes cursors, Shared Drive-aware delta draining,
  bounded full reconciliation, cursor-invalid repair, and a default-off
  Workspace Events wake seam. Normalize My Drive's root alias before ancestry
  checks and preserve cumulative item, provider-request, and elapsed budgets
  across delta, continuation, and full-repair checkpoints. Carry bounded
  per-object revision floors across delta-to-full and checkpointed full scans so
  older or equal Drive revisions cannot regress accepted metadata/current-version
  state, fail closed on conflicting fallback identities, and keep the first
  observation in one scan generation as a durable monotonic floor. Fence item
  version/metadata writes plus checkpoint and terminal cursor settlement to the
  exact lease, initiating subject, scan, checkpoint generation, and accepted
  floor, so a lost full-page checkpoint cannot replay version 8 as version 7.
- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.
- ff7203c: Add a read-only Atlassian Jira and Confluence connector with shared OAuth setup, selected-source live agent search and reads, and optional governed knowledge synchronization.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- d1db1d3: Make agent-spawned workers inherit omitted model, reasoning, and latency settings from the exact calling turn so Codex subscription sessions do not silently fall back to OpenGeni-credit models.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- df985c0: Keep turn-activity heartbeats and the Temporal SDK cancellation throttle at 500
  milliseconds so Pause and Steer retain the full four-second physical-cancellation
  budget for writer drain and receipt-gated replacement admission.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 7b2d5ff: Add trust-gated in-session capability recommendations, human-owned authorization
  requests, and a GitHub owner-consent flow that returns to the initiating session.
- d1189ba: Add the OpenGeni-owned document, spreadsheet, and presentation authoring engine,
  its durable API/domain/live-sync surfaces, first-party React workbench, and
  editable-artifact client SDK. Publish independently lazy, identity-pinned browser
  WASM runtimes for each editor modality.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 13b961e: Add an atomic terminal session-subtree cancellation command that drains queued work, fences concurrent prompts and child creation, interrupts live attempts, durably reports cancelled children to surviving parents, and exposes the operation through the API/core/SDK control surface.

  the accepted logical-turn boundary, add immutable per-session policy roles, and
  compose the resulting exact-attempt governance into agent and compaction prompts.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b3e46f: Allow a digest-pinned capability-pack sandbox image to bind an immutable Modal image ID. OpenGeni now preserves the logical OCI digest on the lease, starts the provider-native image through `ModalImageSelector.fromId`, records the actual ID in the Modal session envelope, clears lower-precedence IDs when a rig overrides the image, and keeps catalog image metadata aligned with the runtime manifest.

### Minor Changes

- dd71248: Make workspace-owned MCP OAuth connections the default, add explicit personal

  S256, Reddit permanent grant) with encrypted token storage and just-in-time
  refresh, live first-party MCP tools (search, mentions, thread fetch, own-post
  sync, permission-gated reply publishing), a reddit provider in the marketing

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- Add `TranscriptionService` / `TranscriptionProvider` port and optional
  `AppDependencies.transcription` for native workspace voice-input transcription.
- Allow `available({ workspaceId })` so providers can require a workspace-attached
  credential during selection (Codex subscription STT).

## 0.13.9

### Patch Changes

- 710b081: Keep sessions usable when a previously selected MCP capability is disconnected or removed. Unavailable historical refs remain visible in effective policy but are omitted from executable tools, and the agent receives a bounded turn-level warning not to claim access to the missing source.
- b7df541: Prevent provider-native checkpoint capture from racing sandbox operations while
  the provider has paused the source box. Capture now owns a durable
  lease/epoch/instance/generation claim, blocks new holders and mutations, drains
  provider-local reads before entering the exclusive snapshot call, and retains
  ownership through late provider settlement and exact stale-claim recovery.
  Modal's typed completed-exec stdin race is also normalized into a side-effect-free
  terminal poll, so an exec that exits between local lookup and the provider write
  settles its retained process instead of failing the enclosing turn.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1973d2a: Treat provider-native web search as an always-on runtime capability whenever
  the selected provider supports it. Session MCP selection no longer disables
  native search.
- 8478e60: Default workspace-tracking sessions to every configured MCP server while
  preserving exact explicit API allow-lists. Keep OpenGeni's internal carrier and
  default-on Files surface out of the web picker's visible choices and counts.
  Settle provider-native web searches from their own terminal status, render each
  web action truthfully, keep completed searches before the answer they informed,
  and hide unresolved private citation handles from the human timeline.

- 5511c24: Add a secure workspace-shared OpenGeni Slack bot connection with schema-backed verified-install eligibility, immutable team/bot identity across reinstall, idempotent post-operation convergence, exact scope validation, first-party channel/history/user/post tools, explicit scheduled-task routing and rebinding, and install/reinstall/recovery UI and documentation.

### Patch Changes

- fd764e0: Route direct file, Git, and terminal calls to a machine-targeted session from the first request without creating a phantom provider lease, and make token-driven agent installation replace stale enrollment credentials.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 32011f1: Add an optional durable host event and usage export for embedded deployments: source-transactional bounded snapshots, immutable turn attribution and session-root lineage, named at-least-once checkpoints, multi-replica leases, replay and retention controls, explicit poison-record disposition, an isolated exporter database role, and a worker delivery pump. Standalone deployments keep capture disabled until a host registers a sink.
- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- 1f9305b: Add a host-owned session authorization port for embedded deployments. The port
  receives server-resolved root lineage and live agent-attempt authority, scopes
  session listing inside database queries, distinguishes exact from whole-tree
  projection access, gates HTTP/core/first-party MCP/Toolspace surfaces, and
  periodically reauthorizes idle SSE streams while standalone deployments retain
  their existing behavior when the port is unset.
- 8c66185: Let agent-created child sessions inherit omitted repository, MCP tool, and
  per-session MCP server context from their trusted immediate parent. Explicit
  arrays remain authoritative, mixed Git providers and multiple bindings are
  preserved, and credential headers are copied only as encrypted ciphertext.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 332ac15: Add workspace-scoped operator session-revival admission helpers and pending-work guards for safe control-plane recovery tooling.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- b34b912: Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

  Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

  When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.
