# GCP Reference Substrate

This root creates a cleanup-friendly GCP substrate for the Helm chart:

- GKE cluster and managed node pool with Workload Identity enabled.
- Artifact Registry Docker repository.
- GCS bucket for `OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs`, with uniform bucket-level access and public access prevention.
- Secret Manager runtime secret placeholder.
- Runtime service account for Workload Identity, GCS access, Secret Manager access, signed URL generation, and Artifact Registry image pulls.
- Optional Cloud SQL PostgreSQL when `postgres.mode = "managed"`.
- Private Service Connect / service networking for managed Cloud SQL when `postgres.private_ip_enabled = true`.
- `temporal.mode = "officialChart"` output wiring for the stack-wrapper managed upstream Temporal chart, or `external` for Temporal Cloud/customer endpoints.

Connected Machines (`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=selfhosted`) add one more deployed
component, the `opengeni-relay` stream relay. Its image is pushed to the same
Artifact Registry repository as the API/worker/web images (no extra registry
resource is required). The relay pairs each channel's producer and consumer in a
per-replica in-memory registry, so its public wss ingress must route both dials
for a channel to the same replica (consistent-hash / session affinity keyed on
the channel) whenever more than one relay replica runs. See `docs/deployment.md`
(Connected Machines) for the full relay/NATS/secret wiring.

Keep Opengeni workloads in the provider-neutral Helm chart. This root should only create cloud substrate and emit non-secret Helm values.

Managed Postgres defaults to `edition = "ENTERPRISE"` and `availability_type = "REGIONAL"` for production resilience. Short-lived evaluation stacks can set `postgres.availability_type = "ZONAL"` with `deletion_protection = false` to reduce cost.

Regional GKE clusters distribute node pools across zones by default. Short-lived evaluation stacks can set `gke.node_locations = ["<zone>"]` and smaller node counts to avoid creating one node group per zone; omit `node_locations` for production multi-zone resilience.

## Validate

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp fmt -check
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp validate
```

## Apply

Before creating resources, decide where the operator will keep exact resource
names, cleanup notes, and generated access material. Keep those records outside
the repository along with Terraform state, plans, kubeconfigs, and filled
tfvars.

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Do not commit state, kubeconfigs, generated database passwords, service-account keys, GCP credentials, or filled secret values.
The official Temporal chart still needs durable Postgres databases prepared outside the Opengeni app chart before Helm install.
