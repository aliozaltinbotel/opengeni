# Integrations: connections, token broker, and the MCP OAuth client

**Audience:** maintainer. **Status:** design locked (I0, 2026-07-03). Implementation lands in phases I1–I6 (program tracker lives with the orchestrator; phase acceptance criteria in §12).

## 1. Overview

OpenGeni gains a first-class integrations layer: users connect external services (one browser OAuth round-trip or a pasted key), agents use them through MCP, and credentials live behind a single broker that no model, sandbox, or workflow payload can see.

Strategy (decided): **MCP-first.** We implement the MCP authorization spec (revision 2025-11-25) _client side_ once; every vendor-hosted remote MCP server becomes installable by URL or domain with zero OpenGeni-side provider registration. OpenGeni-registered provider apps (GitHub App today, Slack bot later) are a selective add-on, not the default path. No third-party iPaaS in the core.

Three layers, kept distinct throughout this doc:

| Layer       | Question                                | Owner                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Acquisition | How does a credential come to exist?    | OAuth flows, manual entry, app installs |
| Storage     | Where does it live, who may read it?    | `connections` table + AEAD envelope     |
| Use         | How does a tool call get authenticated? | Token broker at MCP request time        |

## 2. The `connections` model

One table is the spine for all external credentials, declared in `packages/db/src/schema.ts` following house style (camelCase fields → snake_case columns, `accountId` + `workspaceId` on every workspace-scoped table for RLS), with SQL migration `0039_connections.sql` in `packages/db/drizzle/` including the standard `ENABLE`/`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `workspace_isolation` policy via `opengeni_private.workspace_rls_visible(account_id, workspace_id)` and a `current_schema()` guard (embed-schema compatible).

```
connections
  id                      uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()
  account_id              uuid not null → managed_accounts, cascade
  workspace_id            uuid not null → workspaces, cascade
  subject_id              text nullable — null ⇒ workspace-shared (bot identity);
                          set ⇒ personal, on-behalf-of that subject
  provider_domain         text not null — canonical domain key ("slack.com", "linear.app");
                          first-party pseudo-providers namespaced ("opengeni:github-app")
  kind                    'oauth2' | 'api_key' | 'app_install' | 'delegated'   (CHECK)
  status                  'active' | 'needs_reauth' | 'revoked' | 'error'       (CHECK)
  credential_encrypted    text not null — AEAD envelope (§3), single JSON bundle
  granted_scopes          jsonb string[] default [] — as granted, not as requested
  expires_at              timestamptz nullable — access-token expiry
  last_refresh_at / last_used_at / last_error
  version                 integer not null default 1 — CAS guard (§4)
  metadata                jsonb object default {} — account handle/email, AS issuer,
                          resource URI, PRM snapshot, display name; NEVER secret material
  created_by_subject_id / updated_by_subject_id
  created_at / updated_at
Indexes: (workspace_id, provider_domain, status), (workspace_id, subject_id, provider_domain),
         (workspace_id, kind), (workspace_id, expires_at)
```

Decisions baked in:

- **No uniqueness on `(workspace, subject, provider, kind)`** — providers legitimately allow multiple accounts per workspace. Reconnecting an existing connection updates it in place (CAS); connecting an additional account creates a new row. Dedupe by external account identity, if ever needed, keys on `metadata.externalAccountId` in SQL, not schema.
- **No `pending` status** — in-flight OAuth grants are stateless (signed state, §5.2); a row is created only on successful callback.
- `credential_encrypted` is the only column that may hold secret material; `metadata` is UI-renderable verbatim. API list/get helpers never select `credential_encrypted`.
- Revoking sets `status='revoked'` (row kept for audit) and best-effort calls the provider's revocation endpoint when known.

**Ownership defaults.** New providers default to workspace ownership. Mail, calendar, contacts and drive setup suggest personal ownership. Users can explicitly choose either. OAuth profiles describe protocol requirements and optional `defaultOwnership`; they cannot prohibit a supported ownership choice. Reconnecting preserves the saved ownership.

Generic MCP OAuth applies its profile default when ownership is omitted. The Integration Definition OAuth API requires an explicit ownership for a new account, while native setup supplies the user's choice. Workspace sharing uses the authorized provider account; it does not create a separate provider identity.

**Only a managed human may own a personal connection**
(`apps/api/src/connection-ownership.ts`). An API key, the shared `configured:`
key, a service principal, an agent attempt, a grant that fails
`contextIntegrity`, and any principal whose grant subject is not its
authenticated subject are refused with an explicit **422** before a connection
is created — never silently downgraded to workspace ownership. Two
independent facts require it: personal execution resolves only through the
immutable delegation snapshot frozen on a *human's* causal turn or scheduled
task, and `bind_connection_authority` (migration 0256) can mint the `user`
authority scope only for a subject holding an active organization membership, so
a machine-owned personal row lands on the `legacy_user` compatibility lane and
can never become a real organization-scoped authority.

`principalKind` is the trusted allow-list: exactly `human_session` passes and
unknown provenance fails closed. The delegated-token contract forbids a
`human_session` claim from carrying `serviceInitiator` or exact agent-attempt
authority. This ownership-value helper and `requireConnectionAuthorityOwner`
share the core checks: `contextIntegrity`, exact authenticated/grant subject
identity, `principalKind: "human_session"`, and no service-initiator provenance.
They are intentionally not identical: this helper additionally rejects every
OpenGeni-reserved machine-subject namespace as defence-in-depth. Start-time
ownership-value rejection is a 422; the sibling self-owner authority surface
uses a 403.

A reserved-namespace check on the subject (`api_key:`, `configured:`, `worker:`,
`sandbox:`, `scheduled_task:`, `attempt:`, `service:`) is defence-in-depth
against a delegation-secret holder signing a human claim over an
OpenGeni-minted machine subject. It is deliberately **not** an allow-list of
human subjects: `docs/embedding.md` states that `subjectId` "remains opaque to
OpenGeni" and that hosts must not have the kind inferred from a subject-id
prefix, so a trusted embedding host legitimately signs `human_session` over a
non-`user:` subject.

`connection-ownership.test.ts` asserts that every machine subject in its list is
rejected. Be precise about what that buys: the list is hand-maintained on both
sides, so the test catches a namespace being *removed* from the constant and
documents the known machine subjects, but it **cannot** fail when a genuinely
new machine namespace is introduced elsewhere in the repo — adding one there is
a manual step. That residual gap is acceptable only because this check decides
nothing on its own: a new machine namespace still arrives with a
non-`human_session` `principalKind` and is refused on that basis.

**Personal-only connector states are bound to their flow.** The Google Drive and
Atlassian OAuth states carry no `ownership` field and no provider identity (both
connectors are personal-only by construction), and their return path is
byte-identical to `/workspaces/<id>/capabilities` — a path the MCP OAuth start
signs from caller input. Before the flow-kind discriminator, a caller's own MCP
state therefore reached those callbacks and passed their personal-owner fence.
That was never an escalation (same subject, and the callback independently
rechecks `connections:write`), but the state was not bound to the flow that
minted it. Both states now carry an exact `kind`, checked before anything else
in their parsers.

**OAuth callbacks enforce a signed claim, not a subject shape.** A callback
carries signed state and no live principal, so it cannot re-evaluate
`principalKind`. Every start path that may persist a personal owner therefore
stamps a `personalOwnerVerified` claim into its HMAC-signed state, and all five
callbacks that can persist one — Integration Definition OAuth, MCP OAuth,
Google Drive, Atlassian, and social — require it. A state minted before the
claim existed simply lacks it and fails closed, which closes the one
`oauthStateTtlMs` in-flight window across a rolling deploy. This is also why the
MCP callback's legacy `ownership: … ?? "personal"` decode cannot land a
machine-owned row. Callback refusals retain each flow's existing bounded
redirect/error projection rather than sharing one HTTP status: for example,
Integration Definition OAuth reports `connection_conflict`, while social OAuth
reports `not_authorized`.

The two personal-only first-party connectors (`google-drive/install`,
`atlassian/install`) carry no ownership field at all and always write
`subject_id = <caller>`, so their start routes apply the principal fence
directly.

## 3. Credential encryption

Reuse the existing AES-256-GCM envelope: `encryptEnvironmentValue`/`decryptEnvironmentValue` in `packages/db/src/environment-crypto.ts` (current lossless format `v2:<base64 iv>:<base64 ciphertext||tag>`, with historical `v1` reads retained), keyed by `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` via `environmentsEncryptionKeyBytes` in `packages/config/src/index.ts`. No new key. Unlike capability headers (per-header ciphertext map), `connections.credential_encrypted` stores **one JSON bundle**:

```json
{
  "access_token": "…",
  "refresh_token": "…",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_at": "…",
  "resource": "https://…",
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

Fail closed when the key is missing: API credential writes return 503 (capability-enable style); broker reads throw without echoing secret values. Decryption happens in exactly two places — the broker's decrypt-read helper and the connections domain's refresh/revoke internals. No decrypt helper is exported to app code; the SDK and React packages never see these types (publish-closure guard applies).

## 4. Token broker

The single seam where a connection becomes request-auth material. Two halves:

**DB-backed resolver** (mirrors the Codex pattern in `packages/db/src/codex-token-resolver.ts` exactly): decrypt-read accessor scoped for run use; refresh via OAuth `refresh_token` grant against the stored AS token endpoint; **`(id, version)` CAS** on write with `version + 1` (losers of a cross-process race re-read and adopt the winner's tokens — refresh tokens rotate and can be one-time-use); process-local single-flight keyed `id:version`.

**Runtime injection** — a custom `fetch` on `MCPServerStreamableHttp`, NOT static `requestInit.headers`. Rationale: `mcpServerRequestInit` in `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` is awaited once at construction, so static headers cannot refresh mid-run; the SDK's custom-fetch seam is already proven by the Codex Apps sanitizing fetch. Contract:

```ts
type ResolveConnectionCredentialResult =
  | {
      status: "ok";
      headers: Record<string, string>;
      connectionId: string;
      expiresAt?: Date | null;
    }
  | {
      status: "auth_needed";
      reason:
        | "missing_connection"
        | "expired"
        | "insufficient_scope"
        | "refresh_failed";
      providerDomain: string;
      scopes?: string[];
      resource?: string;
      authorizationUrl?: string;
    };
```

`PrepareToolsOptions` gains `resolveCredential` and `onAuthNeeded`; `prepareAgentTools` composes a broker fetch for servers carrying a `connectionRef`: resolve → inject headers → on 401 force-refresh once and retry → on 403 `insufficient_scope` emit `auth_needed` (§6). Wired from the worker (`apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/tool-environment.ts`) alongside `onRuntimeEvent`.

Broker rules:

- Resolution requires `workspace_id` match and (`subject_id IS NULL` or `= ctx.subjectId`) — re-checked at the broker, not just the API layer.
- Failure is data, not throw: `auth_needed` flows into §6; a dead credential is user-recoverable, never a turn crash.
- Every resolve updates `last_used_at` and emits an audit record (connection id, run id, outcome — never token material).
- 403 step-up must NOT poison good credentials: `insufficient_scope` does not flip status to `needs_reauth`; only an unusable refresh grant does.
- Settings carry only `connectionRef` (non-secret pointer); the `mcpServers` entry schema in `packages/config/src/index.ts` gains an optional `connectionRef { connectionId?, providerDomain, kind?, scopes?, resource?, subjectScope? }`.

The broker passes resolved connection credentials directly to the outbound request rather than deliberately copying them into session configuration, events, run state, or Temporal inputs. OpenGeni does not heuristically scan or rewrite arbitrary provider, user, agent, or tool content if that content contains credential-shaped text; internal persisted and model-visible data remains exact.

## 5. MCP OAuth client (current profile with 2025-03-26 compatibility)

### 5.1 Flow

```
DISCOVER   probe server URL unauthenticated
           → 401 + WWW-Authenticate: parse resource_metadata URL + scope hint
           → RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata (well-known fallback probing)
           → only when the challenge has no resource_metadata and every PRM
             candidate is explicitly absent (404/410), probe the MCP origin's
             RFC 8414 metadata as the legacy 2025-03-26 profile
           → pick AS; RFC 8414 path insertion, then OIDC path insertion/appending
             (no guessed OAuth suffix, tenant-root, or bare-issuer probes)
           → REQUIRE code_challenge_methods_supported ∋ S256, else abort with clear error
REGISTER   priority: (1) operator pre-registered creds for this AS
           (2) DCR (RFC 7591) if registration_endpoint — minted client_id stored per AS
               and registered with the same resolved scope used for authorization
           (3) CIMD if it is the only advertised self-registration mechanism — client_id
               is our hosted metadata URL (§5.3)
           (4) manual client-credential entry in UI
           A reviewed provider profile may explicitly force DCR or CIMD.
AUTHORIZE  authorize URL: PKCE S256, state = signed payload (§5.2),
           resource = canonical MCP server URI (RFC 8707 in modern PRM mode;
           omitted in legacy 2025-03-26 mode),
           scope = requestedScopes when supplied (step-up), else 401-challenge
           scope if present, else PRM scopes_supported
           → browser → provider consent → redirect to callback
CALLBACK   GET /v1/integrations/oauth/callback?code&state
           → verify signed state (single-use nonce, TTL ~10 min)
           → token request with code_verifier + resource
           → encrypt bundle, insert active connection, record granted scopes/issuer
VERIFY     one authenticated tools/list; record tool inventory in metadata
STEP-UP    runtime 403 error="insufficient_scope" → tool.auth_needed → re-AUTHORIZE with
           widened scope on user click; new grant supersedes via CAS update
```

### 5.2 Short provider-facing grant state

When enabled, MCP OAuth sends a short signed reference in the provider-facing `state` parameter. The full signed callback context is encrypted under the variable-sets key and stored in `integration_oauth_pending_states` for ten minutes. It includes the actor and ownership decision, PKCE verifier, client registration, resource, exact discovery provenance, scopes, and return destination. The reference carries only its random row id and account/workspace scope, so provider state-length limits do not reject the grant. The callback verifies the reference, loads the pending context under workspace RLS, checks that the two scopes match, and then validates the full signed state. Existing full signed states remain readable for their normal ten-minute lifetime during rolling deployment. Expired pending rows are removed in bounded batches on later starts in the same workspace.

Issuance is gated by `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_OAUTH_SHORT_STATE_ENABLED`, default `false`. Deploy the new callback reader to every API instance with the flag off. After the old instances are drained, set the flag to `true` in a separate configuration rollout. Readers accept both formats regardless of this flag, so mixed flag values in the second rollout are safe. Resend and other providers with short state limits require the flag enabled.

The PKCE verifier remains encrypted inside the full signed context, which is encrypted again at rest in the pending row. Single-use is still enforced by inserting the context nonce into `integration_oauth_state_nonces`; its primary key makes replay fail across API instances. `integrationsStateSecret` and the variable-sets encryption key must be shared across API instances.

The callback route must NOT call `requireAccessGrant` — a browser redirect carries only `code`+`state`. It trusts exclusively the verified, unexpired state minted by the authenticated start route and the matching scoped pending record.

### 5.2.0 Callback failure landing

Every integration callback returns the browser to a real page with a plain-language outcome:

- MCP OAuth, Integration Definition OAuth, social OAuth, Fiken, and personal GitHub starts default the signed return path to the workspace Plugins page (`/workspaces/:id/plugins`). Atlassian, Google Drive, and the Slack bot install keep their `/workspaces/:id/capabilities` return path, because their callbacks validate that exact signed path; they reach Plugins through the legacy `/capabilities` redirect, which forwards the callback outcome allowlist.
- A provider `error` (the user clicked **Cancel**) is a refusal, not an expired attempt: MCP OAuth reports `stage=authorize` with `reason=access_denied` (or `provider_error` for any other code) and leaves the single-use nonce unconsumed. The provider's own text is never reflected.
- When the state itself is unusable, `oauthStateFailureReturn` decides where to go. A correctly signed state still names its workspace, so the browser returns to that workspace's Plugins page; the reason is `state_expired` when it is only too old and `state_invalid` when its flow rejected it (another flow's kind, an off-origin return path, an unpaired reconnect). An unsigned, tampered, or foreign-secret state returns to `/integrations` with `reason=state_invalid`. This is display routing only; a payload that failed validation never authorizes, resumes, or replays anything, and no provider request is made. MCP OAuth, Integration Definition OAuth, Atlassian, Google Drive, Fiken, personal GitHub, social OAuth, and the Slack bot install share the landing. All but personal GitHub (`invalid_state`) and the Slack install (its own `http_*` reasons) also report the `state_expired` / `state_invalid` reason, and a reused state reports `state_replayed`.
- The web app serves `/integrations` from the Capabilities route chunk: it resolves the viewer's current workspace and replaces the URL with that workspace's Plugins page, keeping only an allowlist of callback outcome parameters (bearer-shaped values such as `slack_link` are dropped). The legacy `/capabilities` redirect forwards the same allowlist.
- The Plugins page maps shared reasons (`access_denied`, `provider_denied`, `provider_error`, `missing_code`, `state_expired`, `state_invalid`, `state_replayed`) to copy with a retry step. The Google Drive, Atlassian, and Fiken readers use that shared copy before their provider-specific fallback, so an expired link is never presented as an OAuth configuration fault. An outcome that names a catalog item reopens its sheet with the message; one that names none shows a persistent notice with **Show connections**.

### 5.2.1 Authorization-server clients

DCR-minted OAuth clients are deployment-wide authorization-server identity, not per-workspace user credentials. They live in `integration_oauth_clients`, keyed by AS issuer, with `client_secret` encrypted under the variable-sets key when present. This keeps one DCR client reusable across many workspace connections to the same AS, while the actual access/refresh tokens remain in workspace-scoped `connections.credential_encrypted`. Operator pre-registered clients are read from `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_OAUTH_CLIENTS_JSON` and are not copied into Postgres.

Some authorization servers advertise both CIMD and DCR but reject a metadata-document URL as the authorization `client_id`. OpenGeni therefore prefers the authorization-server-issued DCR identity whenever both mechanisms are advertised. The DCR client is reused deployment-wide and replaced when its registered endpoints, redirect URI, or scope policy becomes stale. A reviewed provider profile may explicitly force CIMD when a server's advertised registration endpoint is unsuitable (§5.2.2).

### 5.2.2 Provider OAuth quirks as data (profiles)

Providers that need a pre-registered client with pinned metadata, an exact
resource URL, a fixed scope set, or non-standard authorize
parameters are expressed as an `OAuthProviderProfile`
(`apps/api/src/integrations/oauth-profiles.ts`), never as a provider branch in
the flow. `oauth-client.ts` resolves exactly one profile per start and reads
every quirk from it: start-time payload fences (caller-client rejection,
provider identity, exact MCP URL, required deployment client), ownership
defaults, exact-URL reconnect binding and connection
selection, post-discovery authorization-server origin pins, `resource`
parameter suppression, extra authorize parameters, and an exact scope override.

Profiles come from two layers with a fixed resolution order — built-in, then
catalog, then default:

- **Built-in profiles** (hosted Slack MCP, official Gmail) live in code as data
  because their fences are security invariants that must not depend on catalog
  import state. Reserved authorization servers (Google's) are an adjacent data
  table. Deployment-managed client
  credentials (Slack's `OPENGENI_SLACK_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`) resolve through a
  keyed table that only built-in profiles can reference.
- **Catalog profiles** ride a global catalog row as `metadata.oauthProfile`
  (curated overlay `oauthProfile` -> importer -> `capability_catalog_items`),
  zod-validated at use time. A catalog profile applies only when no built-in
  matched and can only narrow the default flow: its schema cannot express
  deployment-client keys or reserved-server membership, so catalog data can
  never loosen a built-in fence or borrow Slack's credentials. This is how a
  new pinned-client provider is added with no API change.

### 5.3 Our client identity (CIMD)

Served publicly at `GET /v1/integrations/oauth/client-metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "<this document's exact URL>",
  "client_name": "OpenGeni",
  "redirect_uris": ["<publicBaseUrl>/v1/integrations/oauth/callback"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none",
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "response_types": ["code"]
}
```

`client_id` byte-matches its serving URL. Base URL is `settings.publicBaseUrl` (`OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, already required in managed mode); HTTPS is enforced when integrations are enabled outside local dev. Per-deployment documents differ by construction, so staging/prod/embedded hosts each get their own client identity automatically.

### 5.4 Client-side security requirements

- PKCE S256 always; refuse ASes not advertising it.
- `state` signed, single-use, TTL-bound, workspace+subject-bound; callback validates all of it.
- RFC 9728 discovery probes the well-known prefix before the resource path,
  then the origin-root location, after any explicitly advertised metadata URL.
  It does not guess metadata beneath the resource API path: a protected API
  catch-all there may return 401 even when metadata is absent. Explicitly
  advertised URLs remain authoritative regardless of their path shape.
- RFC 9728 PRM is authoritative whenever present. Malformed, contradictory,
  unreachable, redirected-to-unsafe, or otherwise invalid PRM is a hard failure;
  it never causes a legacy downgrade.
- Automatic legacy discovery requires a real Bearer/OAuth challenge without
  `resource_metadata`, explicit absence of every PRM candidate, valid RFC 8414
  metadata at the MCP URL's own origin, an issuer matching that metadata
  authority, and a same-origin MCP-resource-to-issuer binding. Cross-origin
  legacy servers require a reviewed profile/manual decision.
- `resource` (RFC 8707) is sent on both authorize and token requests in modern
  PRM mode, subject to reviewed provider-profile suppression. It is always
  omitted in legacy 2025-03-26 mode.
- Exact-match redirect URI only; never follow AS-supplied alternative redirects.
- SSRF guard on PRM/AS-metadata/token-endpoint fetches: no private-range targets unless running in local/test or `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_TARGETS=true`.
- No token passthrough: tokens minted for an MCP server go only to that server; our own first-party MCP servers keep validating audience on inbound tokens.
- Token responses stored, never logged.

## 6. Tool↔connection contract and `tool.auth_needed`

MCP server settings entries carry the optional `connectionRef` (§4). Behavior when the broker returns `auth_needed`:

- **Tool call time:** the call short-circuits before any network I/O; a `tool.auth_needed` session event is published, and the model receives an MCP error result (`isError: true`, "Authentication required — a connection link was posted to the session") so it can adapt. The turn continues; **this is not a `session.requiresAction` pause** (approval gates persist run state and block; a missing connection is a tool-level condition). If product later wants blocking OAuth, that's an explicit extension.
- **Connect/tools-list time:** credential-backed servers are best-effort: publish the authorization-needed event and skip the unavailable server while the turn continues. The Gmail REST bridge preserves the broker's reason at startup as well as tool-call time. Ambient startup notices remain in diagnostics to avoid repeated consent prompts during unrelated work. When a needed personal integration lacks tools, the agent can post an authorization request. Connect uses the initiating user's own account; sharing a conversation never grants another participant access to it. Concrete tool-call authority failures resolve by exact server identity.

Event: `"tool.auth_needed"` added to `SessionEventType` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` AND the hand-written mirror in `packages/sdk/src/types.ts` (parity test pins them), plus the structural flush set in `apps/worker/src/activities/streaming.ts` so the chip appears promptly. Payload: `{ serverId, toolName?, providerDomain, connectionId?, reason, scopes?, resource?, authorizationUrl?, subjectId? }` — no verifiers, secrets, or raw provider responses; `authorizationUrl` only when free of secret material. Timeline projection (`packages/react/src/timeline/projection.ts`) renders a waiting-tone notice with a Connect action; copy is plain language (provider name + "needs a connection"/"needs additional access") — no kind enums, no "CIMD"/"DCR", no status slugs.

## 7. Access control

New permissions `connections:read` (metadata/status only — never secrets) and `connections:write` (create/update/delete/revoke/start-OAuth), added in all three places the permission registry lives: `Permission` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, `KNOWN_PERMISSIONS` in `packages/sdk/src/types.ts`, `allWorkspacePermissions` in `packages/db/src/index.ts` (SDK parity/coverage tests enforce this). `workspace:admin` implies both, per `hasPermission` semantics in `packages/core/src/access/index.ts`.

Subject-ownership is enforced in helper predicates + domain logic (DB RLS is account/workspace-scoped and cannot see the caller subject): readers see shared rows plus their own subject rows; admins may revoke subject-owned rows but not use them or read beyond provider + status; the broker re-checks at resolve time.

**Execution boundary:** native credential resolution uses the durable turn's immutable initiating user and captured account selection, not the technical worker identity. Children retain that authority; scheduled runs use their named owner. Codemode follows the same rule. No host credential-resolution lane is required.

`subjectScope: "subject"` remains representable for forward compatibility, but
the standalone table resolver currently fails it closed because it does not load
subject-owned rows. Use the embedding host resolver for subject-scoped provider
connections until standalone subject resolution is implemented.

## 8. API surface

Route module `registerConnectionRoutes` in a new `apps/api/src/routes/` file, registered in `apps/api/src/app.ts` beside capabilities/codex/social:

- `GET/POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/connections` (+ `GET/PATCH/DELETE …/:connectionId`) — gated `connections:read`/`connections:write` via `requireAccessGrant`.
- `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/connections/oauth/start` — `connections:write`; runs DISCOVER+REGISTER, mints signed state, returns the browser authorize URL.
- `GET /v1/integrations/oauth/callback` and `GET /v1/integrations/oauth/client-metadata.json` — added to the exact-path public exemptions in `apps/api/src/http/auth.ts` (alongside the GitHub callbacks). Only these two paths; no broad `/v1/integrations/*` exemption.

Config additions in `packages/config/src/index.ts`: `integrationsEnabled` (`EnvBoolean.default(false)`, env `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED`), `integrationsStateSecret` (required when enabled outside local dev), `integrationsAllowPrivateNetworkTargets` (`OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_TARGETS`, default false), and `integrationsOauthClientsJson` (`OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_OAUTH_CLIENTS_JSON`, operator pre-registered clients keyed by AS issuer/URL). Boot validation: enabled + managed mode ⇒ `publicBaseUrl` present and HTTPS.

## 9. UX surfaces (built in I3; contract fixed here)

- **Integrations page** (workspace settings): catalog grid (search, verified/community badges), connected list with health (status, expiry, owner badge workspace/personal, last used), connect/disconnect, add-by-URL, add-by-domain (I4), paste-a-key rendering catalog credential facts (setup deep link + text).
- **Connect flow:** click → confirmation modal showing the _domain_ and requested scopes → browser OAuth → return with the connection live. Domain confirmation is mandatory for registry-sourced and agent-initiated connects.
- **In-session:** the `tool.auth_needed` chip folds into the turn per existing timeline fold rules.

## 10. Discovery & catalog (I4)

Runtime OAuth discovery and catalog OAuth diagnostics share
`packages/network/src/mcp-oauth-discovery.ts`. Catalog results are diagnostic
cache only; a connection attempt always performs fresh runtime discovery under
the current DNS/IP/SSRF and redirect policy. Auth-gated rows carry one of:
`oauth_rfc9728`, `oauth_legacy_same_origin_metadata`,
`oauth_legacy_default_endpoints_unverified`, `oauth_requires_profile`, or
`oauth_discovery_broken`.

- Source-of-truth order: (1) the service's own well-known signals probed at add-by-domain time, (2) a **vendored, reviewed snapshot** of the integrations.sh registry (MIT) — import pipeline re-verifies `detected` entries (probe endpoint, confirm PRM) and demotes the rest to `community`, (3) the committed **curated overlay** `data/catalog/curated.json`, keyed by exact MCP URL, which wins over the snapshot field-by-field and carries reviewed first-party contracts, branding, category, and the checkable `featured` / `official` flags. Never live-consume the registry at request time; snapshots are versioned with import provenance. See `docs/capabilities.md` § Curated overlay.
- Catalog rows extend `capability_catalog_items` with surface type, MCP URL, transports, credential facts, tier, provenance.
- **Consent copy is data, not frontend code.** A curated row may carry a `presentation` object (provider name, icon, introduction, capabilities, permission summary, scope labels) that flows overlay -> importer -> `metadata.presentation` and renders in the connector sheet's connect step through `capabilityPresentation()` / `presentationPermissions()` (`apps/web/src/components/capabilities/integration-experience.ts`); API integration definitions serve the same shape from `INTEGRATION_DEFINITION_PRESENTATIONS` (`@opengeni/capabilities`) on the definitions endpoint, and it is available to any future definition surface - the one-row-per-provider integration sheet does not render it today, so that definition-side copy currently has no web consumer. Presentation is cosmetic only — it never grants a scope or replaces server-side authorization, a malformed object degrades to the generic copy, and an uncurated connector renders exactly the pre-existing fallback. The provider-neutral `COMMON_SCOPE_LABELS` stay in the web bundle.
- Phase I4 imports use `scripts/import-integrations-catalog.ts` against a reviewed snapshot or precomputed `importRows` file. Imported rows are global `source: "registry"` capability rows keyed by `(provider_domain, mcp_url)`, linked to `import_batches`, and stale-marked on removal rather than deleted. Logo URLs are fetched at import time and stored as self-hosted object-storage assets (`logo_asset_path`); third-party logo URLs are not served from the catalog.
- **Agent registry tools (implemented):** `capability_catalog_search` lets a session query the trusted merged catalog for capabilities it lacks, and `capability_authorization_request` emits a concrete, attempt-fenced `tool.auth_needed` recommendation with mandatory human domain confirmation. The agent can never silently add a server. The web resolves live catalog state again before acting: supported OAuth MCPs return to and enable from the originating session, while API-key/variable/admin-review cases use the protected Capabilities setup sheet. GitHub remains on its existing owner-authority spine until I6; its adapter mints fresh browser-only `github:manage` state at click time and never widens the worker grant. Enabled personal MCPs are reported ready to the agent only when the exact caller's attempt catalog contains that server's tools. Otherwise discovery reports authorization required and allows a human review card; workspace installation alone does not prove session access.

## 11. Legacy credential sites — convergence

| `capability_installations.config.headersEncrypted`          | Kept for legacy/static header installs. New installs set `config.connectionRef` (validated against workspace + subject policy in `packages/core/src/domain/capabilities.ts`, stripped from untrusted caller config like the reserved header keys). `EnabledMcpCapabilityServer` + `listEnabledMcpCapabilityServers` + `settingsWithMcpCapabilityServers` in `packages/db/src/index.ts` pass the ref through without decrypting; an item with `authModel` satisfies its requirement with either headers or a ref. Backfill decided in I6 with reasons logged. |
| `github_installations` + `github_installation_repositories` | The current workspace binding plus repository allowlist becomes `kind: 'app_install'` in I6; installation-token minting moves behind the broker.

## 12. Security invariants and phase acceptance

Testable gates (each mapped to tests in I1/I2):

1. No raw token in logs, session rows, Temporal payload types, sandbox env, or model context — asserted by a full-flow test that scans sinks.
2. PKCE S256 + signed single-use state + RFC 8707 `resource` on every flow; refuse non-S256 ASes.
3. No token passthrough; per-server audience binding.
4. The broker's decrypt-read is the sole decrypt path for `credential_encrypted`; API reads never select the column.
5. Subject-owned rows unusable by other subjects, including via broker.
6. Human confirms the target domain for every agent- or registry-initiated connect.
7. Refresh races are CAS-safe (`(id, version)`); replayed state rejected.

Phase acceptance:

- **I1:** manual `api_key` connection → real MCP tool call on staging; token absent from all sinks (scripted check); CRUD + permissions enforced; CAS refresh + single-flight unit-tested; `tool.auth_needed` renders in the timeline.
- **I2:** ≥2 real third-party remote MCP servers connected via the full browser flow on staging (CIMD exercised on at least one; DCR fallback on another where offered); refresh observed live; disconnect revokes; step-up exercised.
- **I3:** non-technical path — browse → connect → agent uses tool — live with zero manual config; `auth_needed` chip → connect → next turn proceeds.
- **I4:** domain typed → verified MCP resolved → one-click connect; agent self-discovers a missing capability and elicits; snapshot import pipeline documented + rerunnable.
- **I5:** two subjects, same tool, distinct tokens used correctly; embedded-host credential source substitutes cleanly.
- **I6:** Slack bot connect end-to-end; GitHub App on the spine; security review passed; docs shipped (`bun run check:docs-refs` green, `docs/architecture.md` updated).

## 13. Build order (I1) and known landmines

Build order: contracts/config scaffolding (event type + permissions + `connectionRef` schema, SDK mirrors) → DB schema + `0039_connections.sql` + helpers/tests → broker resolver (single-flight, CAS, 401-retry-once, 403→auth_needed) → API routes + public exemptions + signed state → capability `connectionRef` threading → runtime broker-fetch composition → `tool.auth_needed` events/projection/sanitizer → worker wiring → `bun run typecheck && bun test && bun run check:docs-refs`.

Landmines (from the I0 fit audit — respect these):

- SDK stays zero-runtime-dependency and hand-mirrored; never import contracts/db/config into `@opengeni/sdk`/`@opengeni/react` (publish-closure guard).
- `zod` vs `zod/v4` split: contracts/config use `zod`; MCP-SDK-facing helpers use `zod/v4`; keep new schemas consistent with their package. Bun bundling history makes this non-cosmetic.
- Better Auth/`pg` must stay in `apps/api/src/auth` (workspace-billing static guard).
- Static-header capability path keeps working unchanged; `connectionRef` is additive.
- Migration follows the RLS + `current_schema()` policy-guard pattern; prefer targeted grants over `IN SCHEMA public`.
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts` and `packages/config/src/index.ts` are large shared contracts: narrow edits, no reordering.
