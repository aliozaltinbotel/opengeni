// The selfhosted CONTROL-PLANE transport seam (the M3/M4 layering boundary).

// `@opengeni/agent-proto` (the single-source-of-truth wire types). The session
// knows NOTHING about NATS — it speaks only `ControlRpc`.
//
// M3 ships TWO implementors behind this interface:
//   - `NatsControlRpc` — a thin wrapper over a NATS request/reply connection
//     (the existing `@opengeni/events` bus connection). Constructed LAZILY: if
//     NATS/the relay is not configured it surfaces `agent_offline` rather than
//     throwing at construction, so boot never requires a live NATS.
//   - `MockAgentResponder` — an in-process test double that answers
//     exec/fs.read/fs.write/ping (and the rest of the op table) without any
//     broker, so the session surface + the AgentError→reason mapping are unit-
//     and integration-testable with no live NATS (that is M4).
//
// M4 will HARDEN/REPLACE `NatsControlRpc` (NATS Accounts, real request
// hardening, retries) behind this SAME `ControlRpc` interface — design for that,
// do not duplicate.
