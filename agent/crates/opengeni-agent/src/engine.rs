//! The impure assembly of the pure op engine, at supervisor scope.
//!
//! ONE `Engine` exists per runner process and survives every connection
//! generation (op ⊥ connection). Every [`WorkspaceLink`](crate::supervisor)
//! and every legacy adapter drives jobs through it:
//!
//! * **Registry** — idempotent begin / cancel tombstones / bounded completed
//!   retention (`opengeni-agent-engine::registry`). The per-op state stored in
//!   the registry is [`OpHandles`]: the seq watermark, the terminal record,
//!   and the (bounded, GC-governed) stashed legacy reply for dedup answers.
//! * **Admission** — fair start-ordering + derived circuit breakers, NEVER a
//!   throughput governor (LIMITS-DOCTRINE.md). [`Engine::admit`] returns an
//!   RAII [`AdmissionTicket`]; a queued caller parks until promotion.
//! * **Budgets** — every byte figure is derived from the measured
//!   [`HostCapacity`] as a fraction with the old absolute defaults as FLOORS
//!   (rule R), and the per-frame wire size is T-derived from the negotiated
//!   NATS `max_payload` (the smallest active link value wins).
//! * **Spool ledger** — the global disk budget (PROTOCOL.md ruling M2) is
//!   shared by every job and charged only for bytes actually spooled. Starting
//!   many commands consumes no disk budget; concurrent writes cannot
//!   oversubscribe it.
//! * **Routing** — connection-scoped `op_id → mailbox` for wire-command
//!   delivery. A lost link detaches only the jobs it owns.
//!
//! Lock discipline: every mutex here is a plain `std::sync::Mutex` held only
//! for map/state operations — never across an `.await`, a spawn, or a hook.
