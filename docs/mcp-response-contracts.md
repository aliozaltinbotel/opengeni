# First-party MCP response contracts

Audience: integrators and maintainers of the built-in OpenGeni MCP servers.

OpenGeni's first-party MCP mutation tools return a compact, versioned receipt
instead of returning the full entity they just created or changed. The caller
already has the mutation arguments in its tool-call history; returning prompts,
instructions, commands, evidence, secret values, or other request fields again
wastes model context and duplicates sensitive data across storage and transport
surfaces.

This contract applies to the built-in OpenGeni MCP and docs MCP. It does not
change REST response bodies. Codemode-proxied tools retain the result contract
of their selected first-party, capability, or per-session provider.

## Connector attachment transfer v1

Connection-backed capability and per-session MCP servers can make an authorized
provider attachment available as an exact sandbox file without placing its
bytes or access URL in model-visible output. The provider-neutral contract is
`ConnectorAttachmentTransferEnvelope` in
`packages/contracts/src/connector-attachments.ts`.

A provider returns the private envelope only at the top-level MCP `_meta` key
`opengeni/connector-attachment-transfers`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "providerAttachmentId": {
        "provider": "example",
        "kind": "attachment",
        "value": "opaque-provider-file-id"
      },
      "fileName": "report.pdf",
      "mediaType": "application/pdf",
      "byteSize": 12345,
      "contentSha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
      "source": {
        "url": "https://files.example.test/short-lived-authorized-download",
        "expiresAt": "2030-01-02T03:04:05.000Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The source URL is private transport authority, not a model result. Runtime
handling is fail-closed and ordered:

1. Parse the strict, versioned envelope and reject unsafe filenames, invalid
   media types, non-lowercase SHA-256 values, expired sources, non-HTTP(S)
   sources, URL userinfo/fragments, more than 16 attachments, or any attachment
   larger than 5,000,000,000 bytes. Public identity and content-type fields
   cannot contain HTTP URL references, and credential-bearing query values from
   the private source URL cannot be copied into the provider identity, filename,
   or content type.
2. Require a `connectionRef`-backed server with an explicit provider binding,
   require every attachment identity to use that exact provider namespace, and
   re-resolve its credential after the provider call with the exact workspace
   and immutable initiating subject. The live result must still be authorized
   and must equal the connection ID frozen for the attempt. Revocation, expiry,
   tenant/user mismatch, or identity drift prevents materialization.
3. Remove the entire provider result projection. Provider text, structured
   content, vendor fields, metadata, inline image/audio/blob content, and the
   private transfer key do not enter model output, Codemode output, MCP custom
   data, or durable session events. Inline binary forms fail closed rather than
   being copied beside the out-of-band transfer.
4. Stream the source through Channel A's placement-private importer. The URL is
   written only to a protected file outside `/workspace`; it never enters shell
   arguments, environment, stdout, public receipts, or filesystem events. The
   importer checks expiry, exact byte length, and SHA-256 before atomically
   publishing the target.
5. Return only a bounded receipt plus a concise list of sandbox paths. The
   deterministic target is
   `.opengeni/connector-attachments/<provider>/<identity-digest>/<exact-file-name>`.

The public `_meta` key is `opengeni/connector-attachment-receipts`. Each receipt
preserves provider attachment identity, exact filename, content type, byte
length, SHA-256, and the local sandbox path; it never contains the source URL.
The sanitized provider result is capped at 64 KiB before transfer, and the
worker-generated model/Codemode result is capped at 128 KiB. A multi-gigabyte
attachment therefore contributes only bounded metadata to model context.

Model MCP and Codemode execute the same attempt catalog and the same transfer
hook. Recovery must retry or reconcile the same authorized provider operation
and exact-byte import. It may use Channel A's target-hash replay, but it must
never reconstruct a file from prior model text, tool-result text, event
previews, or another provider attachment identity.

## Mutation receipt v1

The public schema is `McpMutationReceipt` in
`packages/contracts/src/mcp-receipts.ts`. API handlers construct receipts through
`mcpMutationReceipt` in `apps/api/src/mcp/receipts.ts`, which parses the strict
schema before serializing the result. An accidental full-entity or request-field
addition therefore fails closed rather than silently making the result
unbounded.

```json
{
  "receiptVersion": "mcp-mutation-receipt.v1",
  "operation": "session_create",
  "committed": true,
  "outcome": "created",
  "changed": true,
  "resource": {
    "type": "session",
    "id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
    "version": 1,
    "state": "queued"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-07-20T00:00:00.000Z",
  "idempotency": { "status": "applied" },
  "warnings": [],
  "id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "rootSessionId": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "nestedAgentDepth": 0,
  "effectiveMaxNestedAgentDepth": 3,
  "nextAction": {
    "tool": "session_get",
    "arguments": {
      "sessionId": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111"
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields and semantics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `receiptVersion` | Literal `mcp-mutation-receipt.v1`; use this discriminator before reading the rest of the shape. |
| `operation` | The exact MCP mutation tool that produced the receipt. |
| `committed` | Whether the mutation truth described by the receipt committed. A returned `partial_failure` is necessarily committed; validation, authorization, conflict, and fully compensated failures are MCP errors instead of `committed:false` receipts. |
| `outcome` | One of `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `unchanged`, `accepted`, `triggered`, `repaired`, `replayed`, or `partial_failure`. |
| `changed` | Whether this invocation applied a new authoritative change. `repaired` always carries `true`; `unchanged` and `replayed` always carry `false`. |
| `resource` | Primary server-generated identity: `type`, `id`, and, when authoritative for that resource, `version`, `etag`, and current `state`. |
| `relatedResources` | At most eight additional generated resource identities needed to interpret the mutation. |
| `timestamp` | Authoritative resource/update time when available, otherwise receipt creation time. It is an offset-aware ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `idempotency.status` | `not_supported`, `not_requested`, `applied`, `replayed`, or `unknown`. `replayed` is emitted only when the authoritative persistence path says the existing operation was replayed. |
| `partialFailure` | Present only for `partial_failure`; names the failed stage and whether retry is safe. |
| `warnings` | Bounded operational warnings, never request or entity bodies. |
| `facts` | At most 16 bounded scalar operation facts. Nested entities and arbitrary JSON are forbidden. |
| `id`, `rootSessionId`, `nestedAgentDepth`, `effectiveMaxNestedAgentDepth` | Required only for `session_create`. These bounded top-level compatibility aliases preserve the generated session identity and immutable descendant-policy lineage without returning the full session. `id` is validated to equal `resource.id`. |
| `updateId` | Required only for `session_steer`; a bounded compatibility alias validated to equal `resource.id`. |
| `nextAction` | A safe explicit read/follow-up tool plus at most eight bounded scalar arguments. |

The schema is intentionally strict and intrinsically bounded: resource strings,
warnings, scalar facts, related resources, and next-action arguments all have
individual UTF-8 byte/count limits. The complete pretty-printed JSON receipt is
also validated against the canonical 64 KiB model-facing envelope, including
JSON escape expansion.

### Replay, no-op, and partial-failure truth

- **Replay is authoritative.** A retry is `outcome:"replayed"`,
  `changed:false`, and `idempotency.status:"replayed"` only when the underlying
  idempotency store reports a replay. In particular, `session_create`, Send, and
  session control do not infer replay merely from a repeated-looking request.
- **Repair is a change.** A keyed `session_create` that finds a session row but
  installs missing initial events, turn, or runnable state, or commits a new
  workflow-wake revision for queued work, is
  `outcome:"repaired"`, `changed:true`, and `idempotency.status:"applied"`.
  Only a fully initialized retry that issues no new wake is a pure replay.
- **No-op is not replay.** An already-paused task, a deduplicated memory write,
  or another mutation that commits no new state can return `unchanged` with the
  applicable non-replay idempotency status.
- **Session control uses persistence truth on every caller shape.** Agent-bound
  and sessionless/operator `session_pause` and `session_resume` calls both return
  this v1 receipt. A fresh desired-state no-op is `unchanged`; only an exact
  operation-receipt retry is `replayed`. The REST session-control body remains
  its separate compatibility contract.
- **Partial failure means partial commit.** The receipt says which stage failed,
  whether a retry is safe, and what resource identity remains authoritative. A
  scheduled-task database change followed by failed schedule synchronization is
  a partial failure only when compensation failed and the database mutation
  remains committed. If compensation restores the prior persistence state, the
  operation throws an MCP error instead.
- **Session usage-recording failure is returned, not thrown.** Session creation
  and workflow wake have already committed at that point. A keyless receipt is
  `partialFailure.retryable:false` and says not to retry; a keyed receipt is
  retryable only with the same idempotency key. A failed usage-recording attempt
  on a pure keyed retry retains `idempotency.status:"replayed"` and
  `changed:false` while reporting `outcome:"partial_failure"`.
- **Noncommit failures remain errors.** Authorization, input validation,
  missing resources, conflicts, and failures before commit preserve their
  existing MCP error behavior. They do not return a success-shaped receipt.

## Response classification and complete tool matrix

The following is the complete built-in registration inventory. Availability is
still permission-, deployment-, session-, and exact-attempt-catalog-dependent.

| Server / tools | Class | Response contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-party: `set_session_title` | Mutation | v1 receipt |
| First-party: `scheduled_tasks_create`, `scheduled_tasks_update`, `scheduled_tasks_pause`, `scheduled_tasks_resume`, `scheduled_tasks_trigger`, `scheduled_tasks_delete` | Mutation | v1 receipt |
| First-party: `goal_set`, `goal_update`, `goal_progress`, `goal_complete`, `goal_pause` | Mutation | v1 receipt |
| First-party: `wait_for_input` | Mutation | Durable wait receipt (`status`, absolute `deadlineAt`, operation id/replay fact, next action) |
| First-party: `session_wait`, `command_wait` | Read/wait | Bounded durable state/event result; timeout is non-mutating and never cancels work |
| First-party: `rig_propose_change`, `rig_verify`, `rig_promote` | Mutation | v1 receipt |
| First-party: `session_create`, `session_send_message`, `session_pause`, `session_resume`, `session_steer`, `set_other_session_title` | Mutation | v1 receipt |
| First-party: `variable_set_set_variable`, deprecated `environment_set_variable` | Mutation | v1 receipt; secret values are never returned |
| First-party: `knowledge_save` | Mutation | Bounded revision/publication receipt |
| First-party: `files_get_download_url` | Read | Bounded access URL/result required to perform the read; not a redundant entity echo |
| First-party: `github_repositories_list` | List | Existing bounded list/read result |
| First-party: `x_accounts_list`, `reddit_accounts_list`, `social_connections_list`, `social_posts_recent` | List | Existing bounded provider/account or aggregate list result |
| First-party: `x_search_live`, `x_mentions_live`, `x_thread_fetch`, `reddit_search_live`, `reddit_mentions_live`, `reddit_thread_fetch` | Read/list | Existing bounded provider result; the exact connection must match the tool namespace |
| First-party: `x_posts_sync`, `reddit_posts_sync` | Mutation | Existing bounded sync result; writes the durable social-post store and requires an exact provider-matching connection |
| First-party: `social_daily_analysis_context` | Read | Existing bounded analysis input projection |
| First-party: `scheduled_tasks_list` | List | Compact, offset-paginated list result; scheduled-task entity bodies are not returned |
| First-party: `scheduled_task_runs_list` | List | Existing caller-limited run list; not a redundant mutation echo |
| First-party: `scheduled_tasks_get` | Read | Compact summary by default; optional explicitly bounded entity projection |
| First-party: `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_prepare_save`, `knowledge_browse`, `knowledge_get` | List/read | Bounded canonical entry projection including publication status. A model call to `knowledge_search` or `knowledge_prepare_save` receives a compact copy without bookkeeping or repeated preview text; other callers receive the exact result ([details](knowledge.md#model-visible-discovery-results)) |
| First-party: `sandboxes_list` | List | Existing fleet projection |
| First-party: `rig_list`, `sessions_list`, `variable_set_list`, deprecated `environment_list` | List | Existing compact list projections; variable values are never returned |
| First-party: `rig_get`, `session_get` | Read | Existing exact-ID, bounded detail projections |
| First-party: `session_events` | List/read | Existing paginated and byte-bounded monitoring result |
| First-party: `session_wait` | Read (blocking) | Byte-bounded per-target compact event summaries plus exact `latestSequence` cursors, own pending-update count, `waitedMs`, `timedOut` |
| Docs: `list_document_bases` | List | Existing document-base list result |
| Docs: `search_documents`, `knowledge_search` | List/read | Existing bounded retrieval result; a model call to `knowledge_search` receives the same compact copy as the first-party tool |
| Docs: `fetch_document_chunk`, `knowledge_fetch` | Read | Explicit chunk read result |
| First-party: `sandbox_attach`, `sandbox_swap` | Action output | The returned routing target and epoch are the essential result of the action, not an echo of the request |
| First-party: `run_on` | Action output | Essential remote stdout/read/write result |
| First-party: `sandbox_provision` | Action output | Essential provisioning or human enrollment result |
| First-party: `github_connect_link` | Action output | Essential short-lived browser/configuration result |
| First-party: `github_token` | Action output | Essential short-lived credential result; callers must handle it as a secret |
| Codemode catalog tools (dynamic selected tool names) | Exact prepared-tool output | Preserve the exact executor result; Codemode adds no proxy/raw-transfer adaptation. Model-only projections (the 1 MiB spill and compact Knowledge discovery) never apply to Codemode |

Reads, lists, and action outputs are not converted into receipts: their result
contains information the caller did not already provide. This work removes
redundant mutation echo; it is not a blanket instruction to replace useful tool
output with acknowledgements.

## Scheduled-task reads

`scheduled_tasks_list` defaults to 25 rows and accepts `limit` up to 50 plus a
numeric `offset` up to 10,000. It fetches only the requested page plus one row
for `hasMore`, and returns compact summaries. Prompts, goal text, resources,
tools, and metadata values are represented by byte/count facts rather than
serialized in every list row. The complete pretty-printed model result has an
exact 64 KiB cap; when byte pressure drops rows from the pagination edge,
`projection.rowsDroppedForBytes`, `page.hasMore`, and `page.nextOffset` preserve
truthful forward progress.

`scheduled_tasks_get` returns the same summary by default. Passing
`includeEntity:true` explicitly requests a bounded detail projection:

- prompt preview: at most 8 KiB UTF-8;
- goal text and success criteria: at most 2 KiB UTF-8 each;
- resource identities, tool identities, agent metadata keys, and task metadata
  keys: at most 20 each;
- metadata values: never included;
- exact original/delivered byte or count facts and truncation flags; and
- a complete pretty-printed response no larger than 64 KiB.

The full scheduled-task REST detail contract remains available to authorized
non-model clients and is unchanged.

## Compatibility and migration

This is an intentional breaking change for MCP consumers that assumed a
mutation returned a full entity. Small server-authored facts used by existing
session orchestration remain available as bounded compatibility aliases:

- `session_create` preserves `id`, `rootSessionId`, `nestedAgentDepth`, and
  `effectiveMaxNestedAgentDepth` at the top level;
- `session_steer` preserves top-level `updateId`.

The versioned compatibility path is:

1. Detect `receiptVersion === "mcp-mutation-receipt.v1"`.
2. Prefer the primary generated identity at `receipt.resource.id`. For
   `session_create`, the bounded top-level `id` alias remains equal to it for
   existing orchestration consumers.
3. Inspect `committed`, `outcome`, `changed`, and `idempotency.status` instead of
   inferring success or replay from an entity body.
4. When entity details are actually needed, call `receipt.nextAction.tool` or
   the corresponding explicit bounded get/read tool.
5. Do not expect request fields to be copied into the result; retain them from
   the original tool call if the client needs them.

For example, a legacy `session_create` result copied the caller's message and
instructions into a full session:

```json
{
  "id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "initialMessage": "<32 KiB already present in the tool call>",
  "instructions": "<32 KiB already present in the tool call>",
  "status": "queued",
  "queueVersion": 1,
  "createdAt": "2026-07-20T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The new result is the receipt shown at the top of this page. The bounded
top-level lineage aliases are sufficient to spawn descendants under the same
depth policy. Call `session_get({sessionId: receipt.resource.id})` when any other
current session projection is needed.

The REST API is unchanged. The React timeline's worker-reference projection is
a tolerant reader: it recognizes v1 `resource.type:"session"` receipts and the
legacy full-session top-level `id` during migration.

## Measured byte and context reduction

These historical pre-knowledge measurements include the retired Memory tool; they do
not describe the current Knowledge API or impose its former content limit.
The deterministic regression fixture uses production-style pretty-printed JSON
and UTF-8 byte measurement. Approximate tokens are `ceil(bytes / 4)`; they are a
coarse comparison, not provider billing truth. Pathological inputs cover two
32 KiB multibyte session fields, large scheduled prompt/resources/tools/metadata,
large goal fields, the maximum accepted 4,000-byte memory text, and the maximum
8,192-byte rig command plus 2,000-byte note.

| Mutation | Request bytes | Duplicated input bytes | Legacy response bytes | Receipt bytes | Approx. legacy tokens | Approx. receipt tokens | Reduction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `session_create` | 65,610 | 65,536 | 65,998 | 636 | 16,500 | 159 | 99.04% |
| `scheduled_tasks_create` | 113,758 | 111,596 | 114,123 | 544 | 28,531 | 136 | 99.52% |
| `goal_complete` | 98,357 | 98,304 | 131,380 | 535 | 32,845 | 134 | 99.59% |
| `memory_save` | 4,059 | 4,000 | 4,423 | 553 | 1,106 | 139 | 87.50% |
| `rig_propose_change` | 10,276 | 10,192 | 10,587 | 748 | 2,647 | 187 | 92.93% |

The same smaller serialized mutation result is reused by more than the immediate
MCP response. It reduces subsequent model tool history, the persisted
tool-result/event representation, and NATS/SSE/realtime projections:

| Surface | Legacy bytes | Receipt bytes | Reduction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Model history | 66,021 | 613 | 99.07% |
| Event | 66,134 | 816 | 98.77% |
| Realtime | 66,031 | 623 | 99.06% |

Canonical measurement: `apps/api/test/mcp-receipt-size.test.ts`.

## Boundaries and residual compatibility risk

- **Universal output-safety boundary:** receipts are intrinsically bounded and the maximum
  contract-shaped receipt is tested below 64 KiB. Universal output
  normalization/truncation across arbitrary provider and tool output remains
  a separate safety layer; compact receipts do not replace it.
- **Connector/raw-transfer boundary:** only the versioned private transfer key
  above opts a result into exact-byte materialization. Arbitrary provider URLs,
  resource links, inline blobs, and unversioned metadata remain ordinary
  provider output and are not treated as sandbox file authority.
- **Compatibility risk:** public MCP behavior is intentionally breaking for
  third-party clients that parse full mutation entities. Consumers must migrate
  to `receipt.resource.id` plus explicit reads. REST behavior is unchanged.
