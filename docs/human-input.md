# Structured human input

Opengeni has a built-in `request_human_input` agent tool for questions that need
an answer before the current turn can continue. A single request can contain up
to 20 text, single-select, or multi-select questions. Select questions can
always accept an inline `Other` free-text value; requests can optionally allow
Skip and can carry a durable expiry deadline.

Workspace admins can set `agentHumanInputEnabled: false` through the ordinary
workspace settings API. Disabled workspaces omit the tool from model-visible
tools; a stale resume or forged interruption is rejected before the worker can
install a `requires_action` boundary. The setting defaults to enabled.

This is not tool approval. Approval asks whether an already-proposed tool may
run and can approve or reject it. Structured human input is itself a tool call:
when the workspace setting allows it, Opengeni authorizes that built-in call,
freezes it behind the open suffix, and later injects one of these structured outcomes
into that exact call:

- `answered`, with validated question answers;
- `skipped`, only when the request allows it;
- `expired`, when its durable deadline wins the settlement race; or
- `cancelled`, when the owning turn is permanently replaced or terminated.

The agent sees that outcome as ordinary tool output and decides how to proceed.
An `Other` answer is returned exactly as entered. The agent may interpret it as
the answer or issue a new structured request if genuine clarification is still
needed; Opengeni never manufactures an automatic reprompt.
No outcome creates a synthetic `user.message`, no response starts a new logical
turn, and a host must not translate Skip or expiry into approval rejection.

## Durable lifecycle

One `request_human_input` interruption maps to one row in
`session_human_input_requests`. Its deterministic request id is derived from the
session, turn, and SDK tool-call id, so the same logical interruption retains
its identity when a recovery advances the execution generation. The row stores
the validated question contract, carries the current generation as its mutable
settlement fence, and has a strong foreign key to the attempt that first
created it. That creation attempt is immutable provenance; a recovery attempt
does not replace it.

The worker atomically writes the bounded open-suffix pending-tool receipts,
an `agent_run_states` sentinel, all new human-input rows, the
requested events, and the session's `requires_action` status. A crash therefore
cannot expose a request without durable completed-pair history and the open
suffix, or a suffix without its request. On recovery,
Opengeni loads the response selected by the triggering
`user.humanInputResponse` event, writes the paired history result, and
continues from history when the interruption group is empty.
It does not rediscover the response through a best-effort event or tool
call lookup during execution, and it does not require `RunState.fromString`.

Settlement is first-writer-wins under a database lock and compare-and-set:

- a human answer and the expiry timer cannot both win;
- one requires-action boundary admits only one resume event, even when a model
  proposed parallel structured-input and ordinary approval calls. Remaining
  interruptions can settle after the first response is claimed and re-frozen;
- a response is accepted only for the current execution generation;
- a recovery may advance that generation but cannot change the persisted
  questions, Skip policy, or deadline for the same stable tool call;
- a client event id makes response retries idempotent. Replaying the same key
  or submitting a later duplicate returns the already-committed terminal event
  without appending another event or registering another workflow wake;
- Steer, cancellation, supersession, terminal failure, and completion close
  any still-pending request as `cancelled` and append its canonical terminal
  response event. If an older/event-drifted cancelled row lacks that event, the
  first terminal replay repairs it once without waking terminal work. A normal
  human Send received while the active branch is waiting in `requires_action`
  is promoted to the same replacement path: the pending request is cancelled
  and the conversational message runs next instead of entering the visible
  queue;
- resubmitting a checked-out queue Edit is existing accepted work, not a new
  conversational answer, so it preserves the active request and its queue
  placement;
- Pause preserves an unexecuted request, just as it preserves an ordinary
  pending approval. Resume admits that same frozen turn;
- expiry is enforced by a replay-safe Temporal timer and remains correct across
  worker restart or `continueAsNew`. A stale early timer caused by bounded
  workflow/database clock skew re-arms with an interruptible floor instead of
  spinning the workflow and database;

`session_events` remains the exact audit/live projection for accepted payloads.
The request table
is the authoritative actionable read model; event delivery merely tells a
client to reconcile it. Neither store is model conversation history.

## Agent tool contract

The public schemas are in `@opengeni/contracts` and mirrored by
`@opengeni/sdk`:

```ts
type RequestHumanInputToolInput = {
  questions: Array<{
    id: string;
    kind: "text" | "single_select" | "multi_select";
    prompt: string;
    label?: string | null;
    helpText?: string | null;
    options: Array<{ id: string; label: string; description?: string | null }>;
    required: boolean;
    allowOther: boolean;
    validation?: {
      minSelections?: number | null;
      maxSelections?: number | null;
    } | null;
  }>;
  allowSkip: boolean;
  expiresInSeconds?: number | null;
};
```

Text answers have no agent-chosen character min/max (agents invent arbitrary
`≥N chars` rules). Selection min/max remains. Answer strings stay
platform-capped (~8192). The API validates the response again against the
persisted questions: unknown or duplicate question/option ids, missing required
answers, text-answer shape, and selection-bound violations. Every choice
question accepts `Other`, including legacy rows whose compatibility field still
says `allowOther: false`. The runtime normalizes new choice requests to `true`,
while stock React and realtime surfaces expose the free-text path regardless of
that legacy field. User-controlled
regular expressions are intentionally not part of the contract. Legacy
persisted `minLength`/`maxLength` on question JSON is ignored.

## API and permissions

Pending or historical requests are readable with `sessions:read`:

- `GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/human-input-requests`
  (optional `status` query)
- `GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/human-input-requests/:requestId`

The `status=pending` list is the actionable projection: elapsed deadlines and
rows waiting for the workflow to re-freeze a remaining parallel interruption
are omitted until they can truthfully accept a response.

A response uses the ordinary controlled event endpoint and therefore requires
`sessions:control`:

```json
{
  "type": "user.humanInputResponse",
  "clientEventId": "host-generated-idempotency-key",
  "payload": {
    "requestId": "request-uuid",
    "response": {
      "outcome": "answered",
      "answers": [{ "questionId": "region", "values": ["eu"] }]
    }
  }
}
```

The SDK exposes `listHumanInputRequests`, `getHumanInputRequest`, and
`submitHumanInputResponse`. A settled response returns the already-committed
terminal event. A pending request that no longer owns the current
requires-action generation is a `409`; a malformed answer is a `422`; an
unknown request is a `404`.

Slack treats a reply as a structured answer only when the committed outcome is
`answered` or `skipped`. If expiry or cancellation wins after Slack reads the
actionable request, Opengeni still publishes that terminal settlement but then
submits the incoming text as an ordinary message so the conversation never
silently consumes it.

## React and embedded hosts

`@opengeni/react` exposes three layers:

- `useHumanInputRequests(sessionId)` is the headless lifecycle primitive. It
  reads the authoritative pending set, reconciles after relevant session
  events, can share a host's existing event feed, and guards duplicate submits.
- `HumanInputForm` is the accessible default renderer for **one** request. It
  matches the waiting-tone decision surface used by approvals: question-first
  title, compact options (not card-per-option), sticky header/footer inside a
  bounded scroll region, relative deadlines, Skip without a contradictory
  required asterisk on the whole-request skip path, and host overrides for
  title, description, labels, and styling.
- `HumanInputSurface` is the session-host shell: when several requests are
  pending in parallel, it presents them **one at a time** (oldest first) with
  an `N of M` progress label. Send answers/Skip settles the active request; the
  next remaining set advances when the authoritative pending list updates. The
  follow-up composer stays fully available — structured input is not a modal
  that owns the page. Sending from that composer while the session is actively
  waiting cancels the frozen request and routes the message immediately with
  Steer-equivalent priority. An explicitly paused session remains paused, so a
  normal Send there still queues until Resume.

Each single- and multi-select control includes an inline Other option and text
field. Hosts submit that exact value in `answer.other`; they should not create a
synthetic follow-up prompt or coerce it into an option id.

The stock Opengeni session route mounts the hook plus `HumanInputSurface` at the
timeline tip, so the live question is part of the main conversation rather than
a detached strip above the composer. An
embedded product may mount the surface, the single form, compose its own
renderer over the hook, or use the SDK through its backend proxy. It should not
maintain an independent request state machine: access control stays at the
host/Opengeni API boundary, while the Opengeni row, turn checkpoint, workflow
timer, and response event remain the durable truth.

After a response is accepted, the React timeline keeps a chat-native resolved
decision containing both the original question and the human's readable answer.
The matching raw `request_human_input` tool call is not repeated behind a
generic activity step. When the request event is available, question and option
labels replace their wire ids; a readable id-based fallback keeps paginated
history understandable.

Agent-created child sessions use the same tool and lifecycle. Their requests are
owned by the exact child session and surface when that child is opened; the
parent session shows only its existing `Needs you` child signal. An authorized
workspace controller answers on the child route. Settlement wakes the child's
frozen turn and returns the structured result to that original child tool call;
the parent receives only the child's later ordinary terminal result, not a copy
of the human answer.

## Acceptance boundary

Structured input counts as supported only when the contracts, persisted owner,
atomic runtime checkpoint, API authorization, SDK, embed UI, restart/expiry
behavior, and real-database tests all remain present. A form mock or a model
prompt that merely describes a question is not equivalent support.
