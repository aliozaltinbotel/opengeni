# @opengeni/react

React hooks and styled components for OpenGeni, built on
[`@opengeni/sdk`](../sdk): live session streaming, a chat composer, a message
timeline that renders streaming deltas / tool calls / spawned-worker status,
session status badges, and fleet tiles for workspace overviews. Two opt-in
surfaces layer on top: a **sandbox workspace** workbench (files, terminal, diff,
and an optional desktop stream) and, at the
[`@opengeni/react/machines`](#connected-machines-opengenireactmachines) subpath,
the **Connected Machines** dashboard + enrollment flow.

The default root import (`@opengeni/react`) is the clean sandbox-agnostic
surface — the chat/timeline hooks and components plus the sandbox workspace
suite. Advanced chat-composer composition lives under
`@opengeni/react/composer`; Connected-Machine UI lives under
`@opengeni/react/machines`; realtime voice controls live under the lazily
loadable `@opengeni/react/realtime` subpath. (The root barrel still re-exports the machines
island for back-compat, deprecated per #144.)

Design-system-first: every visual decision routes through CSS-variable tokens
(`styles/tokens.css`) — color, typography, radius, shadow, motion. Dark mode is
the first-class default; light is an opt-in via `data-og-theme="light"` on any
ancestor. Components are styled with Tailwind v4 utilities mapped onto the
tokens, Radix primitives for behavior, and Motion for state-communicating
animation. Override the tokens to rebrand everything.

## Embedded connections and Sites

Optional `@opengeni/react/connect` exports `useConnect`, `ConnectChooser`,
`ConnectSetup`, `ConnectAccounts`, and the composed `ConnectPanel`. Inject one
`@opengeni/connect` controller per authenticated actor/workspace and dispose it
when that scope changes. The controller uses your authenticated backend proxy;
never place an organization key in browser props. Import
`@opengeni/react/connect.css` for opt-in, scoped styles without Tailwind.
`DeviceAuthorization` also accepts an optional `render` callback for host presentation;
it receives shared copy state, the copy action, and the validated verification URL.
Omitting it preserves the default embedded presentation.

`CapabilityCatalogRow` gives connections, skills, and plugins one consistent
icon/name/description button with a decorative plus/check and visible exception
states. Supply `onOpen` and an explicit `status`; the host owns setup and
installation. `ConnectionCatalog` accepts the same states through each option's
`state`. Older callers that omit `state` keep their visible status labels, so
provider warnings are not hidden during migration.

`PluginDiscovery` accepts `defaultProvider="openai"` or `"anthropic"` to choose
the initial registry. Omitting it starts with All. Users can still switch among
All, OpenAI, and Anthropic; changing the search preserves their selection. The
OpenGeni Plugins page starts with OpenAI.

```tsx
import { ConnectPanel } from "@opengeni/react/connect";
import "@opengeni/react/connect.css";

<ConnectPanel
  controller={controller}
  returnUrl={hostSelectedReturnUrl}
  onAuthorize={hostAuthorizeFromClick}
/>;
```

The host owns synchronous popup/full-redirect navigation and pending-attempt
recovery. Backend state, not a popup message or URL query, proves completion.
Operation installation uses explicit selection; OAuth success alone is not
installation. Account disconnect requires an observed version and confirmation,
revokes local OpenGeni access only, and never silently retries an unknown outcome.
Provider readiness is deployment-dependent; use the server catalog rather than
assuming every OAuth application or operator-managed provider is configured.

Optional `@opengeni/react/sites` exports `SiteList`, `SiteDetail`, and `SiteClient`.
Pass the public SDK client through your host proxy. `onOpen` owns list
navigation. Authoring buttons and prompts belong to the host and use the ordinary
session SDK; they are not part of the Site component API. `SiteDetail` reuses `PublishedHtmlArtifactFrame`, accepts
an optional authenticated/filtered tool bridge, and removes the frame after
read-authority refresh failure. Loaded Sites revalidate every 15 seconds;
downloaded HTML cannot be recalled and every tool call still needs live authority.

`canPublish` is only a presentation hint. Version-checked rollback/archive/restore
remain subject to backend `artifacts:publish` permission. Sites stay workspace
shared, even if a source session is private. See
[`examples/embedded-product`](../../examples/embedded-product/README.md) for the
runnable loopback host reference. Native route reuse and full visual acceptance
are not implied by these optional package surfaces.
## Conversation UI

`SessionConversation` is the default product integration for an existing
session. Back it with `createSessionProxyHandler` from `@opengeni/sdk`, mounted
on your server, and point an unmodified browser
`new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/api/opengeni" })` at it:

```tsx
import "@opengeni/react/compiled.css";

<OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
  <SessionConversation sessionId={sessionId} />
</OpenGeniProvider>;
```

Compose `MessageTimeline` and `ChatComposer` with the session hooks only when
the product needs a materially different interaction model. These components do
not consume the text-only `@opengeni/sdk/chat` fallback protocol.

`OpenGeniChat` adds the user's chat list to the conversation: a sidebar when
the component is wide and a drawer behind a menu button when narrow (measured on
its own container, so it works inside panels), a new-chat composer that creates
the session from its first message, and inline rename and archive. It is
composed from `SessionList` and `SessionConversation`, which you can also mount
separately. Pass `conversationProps` for message rendering and tool renderers,
`createSession` to create chats through your own endpoint, or `sessionId` /
`onSessionChange` to control the selection (for example from the URL).

`SessionConversation` hides its model picker when the client config reports
`modelSelection: false` (a proxy that fixes the model policy); pass
`modelPicker={false}` or `modelPicker` to override. Attachments appear when the
deployment enables uploads (`attachments={false}` opts out), pending tool
approvals render Approve/Reject, and `toolRegistry` customizes tool rendering.

Highlighted diffs use the optional `@pierre/diffs` peer only after an explicit
opt-in, so a host without it still builds with any bundler (Turbopack resolves
every reachable `import()`). Hosts that install it call `enablePierreDiffs()`
once; call it from the lazily loaded route that renders diffs to keep the peer
out of your initial bundle. Views already on screen upgrade when it registers:

```ts
import { enablePierreDiffs } from "@opengeni/react/diffs";
enablePierreDiffs();
```

Without it, diffs and file views render as plain text.

`OpenGeniProvider` never blocks or reloads the host page when OpenGeni deploys
a new API contract revision. The stock OpenGeni console opts into that
stale-tab protection with `reloadOnApiContractChange`; embedded products
should leave it off.

### Exact conversation search navigation

`useSessionEvents().initialHistoryReady` becomes true when a history window has
loaded successfully, including an empty tail. It stays true through later stream
errors, history navigation, and tip reloads, and resets for a new session/replay
identity. Use it rather than inferring initial success from `initialLoading` or
the combined `error`. A failed first load stays unready until recovery;
`jumpToLatest()` clears its stale error and retries. Full replay has no history
snapshot-completion watermark, so SSE alone does not set this flag.

`useSessionEvents(sessionId).jumpToSequence(sequence)` replaces the current
window with at most two bounded cursor reads around an exact durable event.
It resolves `true` only when that event is retained, `false` for a missing or
superseded target, and rejects current request errors. `loadingTarget` exposes
the pending state. New targets supersede older targets/pages; session/client
changes fence stale results. Search enters history mode; use the existing
`loadOlder`, `loadNewer`, and `jumpToLatest` controls to navigate onward. It does
not download the intervening session history.
Pass `jumpToSequence(sequence, { signal })` to cancel one navigation: an
aborted signal fences the pending jump before its fetched window is applied
(the underlying reads may still complete), resolves `false`, and settles
`loadingTarget` without disturbing any newer navigation that superseded it.

Pass the selected hit to `MessageTimeline` independently of loading:

```tsx
const history = useSessionEvents(sessionId);
const [target, setTarget] = useState<TimelineSearchTarget | null>(null);

function selectHit(hit: { sequence: number; eventId: string }, query: string, occurrence = 0) {
  setTarget({ ...hit, query, occurrence });
  void history.jumpToSequence(hit.sequence);
}

<MessageTimeline events={history.events} items={history.timeline} searchTarget={target} />;
```

The host owns search results, error handling, next/previous controls and query
state. `TimelineSearchTarget` is exported from the root and `session-ui` entry:
`{ sequence: number; eventId?: string; query: string; occurrence?: number; offset?: number }`.
Matching is literal, case-insensitive, non-overlapping; `occurrence` is zero-based
within the message, defaulting to zero. When the backend all-occurrence search
returns `messageMatchOffset`, pass it as `offset`: the zero-based UTF-16 position
of the match in the original message text. An explicit `offset` takes precedence
over `occurrence` and is validated against the query, so a stale offset simply
produces no highlight. `buildTimeline` supplies `sourceEvents`
identities so completed assistant events remain addressable when the renderer
keeps a first-delta ID. Hosts supplying their own items should preserve those
identities (or the canonical `annotationSource`).

The active message's group and long-user disclosure open persistently. Setting
`searchTarget={null}` removes the active highlight without collapsing content or
restoring a former scroll position. The package mounts its complete bounded
window. The default Markdown renderer shows a labeled, bounded **message source**
excerpt for the active match, including Markdown syntax and link destinations;
closing find removes the highlight but retains that excerpt and its layout.
An explicit **Show formatted message** action restores the full body; this can
expand a huge message, so it is never done automatically on closing Find.
Raw UTF-16 offsets are never applied
to rendered Markdown text. Custom hosts can use
`<Markdown searchTarget={searchTarget}>{text}</Markdown>` for the same behavior.
A custom virtualized renderer receives
`renderMessageText(text, item, { searchTarget })` and must materialize the exact
occurrence when that context is non-null. Existing two-argument renderers remain
compatible. If previous occurrences are omitted from the virtualized DOM, wrap
the materialized match in an element with `data-og-search-occurrence` (zero-based
index), `data-og-search-sequence` and `data-og-search-query`, each set from the
target; when the target carries an `offset`, set `data-og-search-offset` to it
alongside `data-og-search-occurrence` (which can be zero). This lets navigation
identify that exact occurrence without recounting an incomplete DOM. Keep the
materialized window when the context clears to
preserve position. Navigation waits for the mounted text and highlights the active
DOM range using the CSS Custom Highlight API, without rewriting React-owned
text. Explicit source-offset targets require this marker: matching characters
at the same rendered offset are not proof of source identity. A custom renderer
that omits source text or puts it in an opaque iframe must reveal that text
itself. Existing renderers without this mapping remain render-compatible but
cannot provide exact source-offset navigation.

## Editable Office artifacts

The optional artifact workbench is isolated from the ordinary session and
realtime entries. The default browser composition owns one verified WASM
Worker, durable IndexedDB state, authenticated live sync, teardown, and the
matching editor for the artifact modality:

```tsx
import workerUrl from "@opengeni/sdk/editable-artifacts/worker?worker&url";
import { BrowserEditableArtifactWorkbench } from "@opengeni/react/artifacts";
import { editableArtifactKernelRuntime } from "@opengeni/artifact-kernel-wasm-spreadsheet";

<BrowserEditableArtifactWorkbench
  options={{
    baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
    workspaceId,
    artifact,
    replicaId,
    storageAuthority,
    runtime: {
      workerUrl,
      ...editableArtifactKernelRuntime,
      applicationOrigin: window.location.origin,
    },
    transport: { credentials: "include" },
  }}
  spreadsheet={{ title: artifact.title }}
/>;
```

`storageAuthority` is the host's authenticated deployment/account/workspace/
principal partition and authorization epoch; it must rotate when that authority
or any static transport credential changes. `replicaId` is a persisted random
64-bit writer id. Cookie auth works through `credentials`; self-hosted browser
consoles may pass static deployment-bound `transport.headers`. Browser API keys
and custom fetch/WebSocket functions stay on the lower-level
`EditableArtifactWorkbenchHost`, whose host supplies its own SDK session factory
and complete `sessionKey`.

Hosts that already own an `EditableArtifactSession` can render one modality
directly. No snapshot or artifact-tool model crosses onto the React thread:

```tsx
import { EditableSpreadsheetArtifactSurface } from "@opengeni/react/artifacts/spreadsheet";
import { EditableDocumentArtifactSurface } from "@opengeni/react/artifacts/document";
import { EditablePresentationArtifactSurface } from "@opengeni/react/artifacts/presentation";

<EditableSpreadsheetArtifactSurface session={spreadsheetSession} title="Report" />;
<EditableDocumentArtifactSurface session={documentSession} title="Brief" />;
<EditablePresentationArtifactSurface session={presentationSession} title="Launch deck" />;
```

The durable document surface composes bounded summary, body, section, and
review queries at one native revision. Text edits become UTF-16-correct minimal
`paragraph.edit` commands; formatting becomes `paragraph.format`. Empty
documents use the SDK's native-namespace structural allocator to create their
first durable paragraph without inventing React-side identity rules.

The durable presentation surface composes the bounded slide catalog and
per-slide editor ABI. It keeps master/layout inheritance and node hierarchy in
the projection, renders inherited nodes read-only in slide mode, and maps
movement, resizing, and rich-text changes to canonical node commands. Geometry
uses the Office EMU-to-CSS-pixel scale; unchanged command fields retain their
exact canonical values. Slide and text-box insertion/deletion likewise use
canonical SDK/session commands; optimistic UI never mutates a shadow deck.

Run `OPENGENI_REACT_DEMO_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8000 bun run demo`, then
open `http://localhost:3100/editable-artifacts.html?workspaceId=<id>`. This is a
live public-SDK reference consumer for all three modalities; it has no in-memory
or permissive fallback.

`DocumentProjectionEditor`, `PresentationProjectionEditor`, and
`SpreadsheetProjectionGrid` expose the same host-owned projection/async-command
boundary without requiring the OpenGeni sync session. Pending, failure, retry,
read-only, focus, and reconciliation behavior stays inside the components.

Projection editors use browser-safe structural views and do not load
`@opengeni/artifact-tool`, its codecs, or native bindings. Local authoring tools
can optionally supply the reference models from `@opengeni/artifact-tool/reference`
to the compatible `DocumentEditor`,
`PresentationEditor`, or `SpreadsheetGrid` adapters. Those convenience adapters
deliberately mutate the supplied public authoring model.
`@opengeni/react/artifacts` remains the all-modality barrel.

## Install & styles

Hosts that render their own UI should import the session-only surface:

```tsx
import {
  useComposer,
  useSessionControl,
  useSessionEvents,
  useTurnQueue,
} from "@opengeni/react/session";
```

That subpath contains session hooks, approval helpers, and the pure timeline
projection only. It does not load the styled composer, timeline, workbench,
CSS, or their optional editor/terminal peers. Pass `{ client, workspaceId }` to
each hook when the host intentionally does not mount `OpenGeniProvider`. The
exported `SessionClientLike` is deliberately narrow: a tenant-safe proxy needs
only session events, composer draft/send, queue, pause/resume, and approval
operations. Hooks outside that baseline expose exact refinements rather than
requiring the full SDK client: `SessionReadClientLike`, `GoalClientLike`,
`SessionLineageClientLike`, `FileAttachmentClientLike`,
`HumanInputSessionClientLike`, and `SessionMcpApprovalPolicyClientLike`. A host
can therefore implement only the methods used by each hook. A shared event feed
also avoids requiring a client-owned event stream at runtime. Workspace-level
Resume is an optional authority.

Use `createEmbeddedSessionClient(base, options)` to bind that narrow surface
from a full SDK client or host proxy. Delegated methods preserve their SDK
receiver, `options.overrides.submitComposerDraft` can route atomic submission
through a host-authenticated endpoint, and `mapComposerDraft` can project every
read/save/submit draft before React adopts it. Construction fails immediately
when a required method is missing, and submit returns the host/native
`SubmitComposerDraftResponse` unchanged apart from an explicitly configured
draft projection.

The styled file surfaces accept a presentation-only node predicate:
`FileBrowser.isNodeVisible`, `SandboxFiles.isNodeVisible`, and
`SandboxWorkspace.isFileNodeVisible`. Hidden parents never expose orphaned
children, hidden selections/reveal requests are ignored, and omitting the prop
preserves the complete authoritative tree. This is not an authorization seam.

The styled root surface ships with ready-to-use CSS. Import it once; the host
does not need Tailwind:

```tsx
import "@opengeni/react/compiled.css";
```

The compiled entry contains the package's Tailwind v4 utilities and tokens,
omits global Preflight, and scopes every style rule to `.og-root`. Components
put that class on their standalone roots, including portalled menus, dialogs,
tooltips, and lightboxes. The low-specificity scope covers both the root element
itself and its descendants, so utilities work in either shape without resetting
the host document or globally registering Tailwind's `--tw-*` custom properties.
Tailwind runtime variables are initialized per element only inside those roots.
Independent package defaults inherit without replacing host `--og-*` values;
derived defaults use scoped effective values so changing a base accent, radius,
motion, or surface token updates its dependents at runtime.

The original Tailwind v4 bridge remains available for hosts that intentionally
want OpenGeni utilities compiled into their own Tailwind entry:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@opengeni/react/styles.css";
@import "@opengeni/react/responsive.css";
@source "../node_modules/@opengeni/react/src";
```

`@source` lets the host compiler discover utilities used inside the components.
`responsive.css` is the small opt-in layout layer for
`responsiveBasis="container"`; omit it when every composer keeps the historical
viewport basis. `compiled.css` already contains that layer. Do not import both
`compiled.css` and `styles.css`. Consuming only the tokens?
Import `@opengeni/react/tokens.css` and use the `--og-*` variables directly.

### Product-compatible theming and density

The default typography and control geometry are the same values used by
`apps/web`. Put theme overrides on one ancestor; SDK popovers and dropdowns
copy the effective `--og-*` values from their trigger across the portal
boundary, so a menu mounted under `<body>` still matches the embedded panel.
SDK type utilities are also scoped against ordinary host resets such as
`.app button { font: inherit }`; customize their public tokens instead of
adding selector-specific overrides.

Every portalled surface is an independent `.og-root`. Token-themed portal
content copies the effective `--og-*` values from its trigger, preserving an
enclosing light, compact, or rebranded theme even though it mounts under
`<body>`; a standalone root with `data-og-theme` or `data-og-density` works
directly as well.

For a narrow product sidebar, opt into the supported compact preset:

```tsx
<aside data-og-theme="light" data-og-density="compact">
  <MessageTimeline {...timelineProps} />
  <ChatComposer {...composerProps} />
</aside>
```

Density and responsive measurement are separate opt-ins. By default,
`ChatComposer` keeps its existing viewport breakpoints. An embed whose composer
can be narrow inside a wide page should measure the composer instead:

```tsx
<aside data-og-theme="light" data-og-density="compact">
  <ChatComposer {...composerProps} responsiveBasis="container" />
</aside>
```

`responsiveBasis="container"` makes the composer root an inline-size query
container. Input density, footer wrapping, command descriptions, paused labels,
model controls, transcription status, and nested realtime controls then follow
that root's actual width. Coarse-pointer target sizing remains a separate media
feature, so a narrow mouse-driven panel stays compact while touch targets remain
at least 44px. Composer-owned model and realtime menus keep their portal
placement but copy the live root width with the existing theme tokens and never
grow wider than that source container. Compound layouts can pass the same prop
to `Composer.Root`. Hosts using the Tailwind source bridge import
`@opengeni/react/responsive.css`; the ready-to-use `compiled.css` includes it.

The preset is only a starting point. Override individual runtime tokens on the
same ancestor without rebuilding Tailwind:

```css
.my-agent {
  --og-font-sans: "Inter Variable", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
  --og-font-size-menu: 12px;
  --og-line-height-menu: 18px;
  --og-font-size-composer-wide: 13px;
  --og-line-height-composer-wide: 20px;
  --og-model-picker-menu-width: 15rem;
  --og-color-accent: oklch(0.58 0.19 288);
}
```

The type ramp is `--og-font-size-{xs,sm,base,md}` with matching
`--og-line-height-*` tokens. Interactive chrome uses the semantic `control`,
`menu`, `composer`, and `composer-wide` pairs. Model picker height, width,
padding, and row-density tokens are grouped under `--og-model-picker-*` in
`styles/tokens.css`; realtime menu width uses `--og-realtime-menu-width`.
`ModelPolicyPicker` also exposes `contentClassName` and
`contentStyle` for exceptional surface-level customization; tokens are the
recommended path.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";
import {
  ChatComposer,
  MessageTimeline,
  OpenGeniProvider,
  QueueSurface,
  SessionStatus,
  useComposer,
  useSessionEvents,
  useTurnQueue,
} from "@opengeni/react";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/api/opengeni" }); // proxy through your API

function OpsChannel({ sessionId }: { sessionId: string }) {
  const { timeline, sessionStatus, hasOlder, loadingOlder, loadOlder } =
    useSessionEvents(sessionId);
  const queue = useTurnQueue(sessionId);
  const composer = useComposer(sessionId, {
    effectiveControl: queue.effectiveControl,
  });
  return (
    <div className="flex h-full flex-col">
      {sessionStatus ? <SessionStatus status={sessionStatus} /> : null}
      <MessageTimeline
        items={timeline}
        status={sessionStatus}
        hasOlder={hasOlder}
        loadingOlder={loadingOlder}
        onLoadOlder={loadOlder}
        className="min-h-0 flex-1"
      />
      <QueueSurface queue={queue} composer={composer} />
      <ChatComposer
        composer={composer}
        effectiveControl={queue.effectiveControl}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export function App() {
  return (
    <OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
      <OpsChannel sessionId={sessionId} />
    </OpenGeniProvider>
  );
}
```

## Realtime composer controls (`@opengeni/react/realtime`)

The realtime subpath is the exact OpenGeni composer experience: model catalog
and selection, split-button motion, start/stop/retry states, microphone and
audio mute controls, diagnostics, recovery, and the same copy, ARIA, classes,
and styling used by the web console. It is deliberately separate from the root
entry so SSR and non-realtime consumers do not eagerly load browser media or
transport code.

For an existing session, place one public component in the composer's action
slot. It resolves `client` and `workspaceId` from `OpenGeniProvider` and reuses
the host's existing session/event projection rather than opening a duplicate
stream:

```tsx
import { ChatComposer } from "@opengeni/react";
import { SessionRealtimeControl } from "@opengeni/react/realtime";

<ChatComposer
  composer={composer}
  effectiveControl={effectiveControl}
  actionsStart={
    <SessionRealtimeControl
      sessionId={sessionId}
      sessionStatus={sessionStatus}
      effectiveControl={effectiveControl}
      events={events}
      eventsReady={!initialLoading}
      codexConnected={codexConnected}
    />
  }
/>;
```

For a new-session composer, create the session with `startMode: "realtime"`,
navigate to it, and pass the selected model to the same existing-session
control's `realtimeAutostartModel` prop:

```tsx
import { NewSessionRealtimeControl } from "@opengeni/react/realtime";

<NewSessionRealtimeControl
  codexConnected={codexConnected}
  onStart={async (model) => {
    const session = await client.createSession(workspaceId, {
      requestedSessionId: crypto.randomUUID(),
      startMode: "realtime",
      idempotencyKey: crypto.randomUUID(),
    });
    navigateToSession(session.id, { realtimeAutostartModel: model });
    return true;
  }}
/>;
```

Proxy-backed hosts can pass explicit `client` and `workspaceId` overrides. The
exported `EmbeddedRealtimeSessionClientLike` requires only catalog, begin,
Codex/Gateway negotiation, activation, heartbeat, ledger sync, and end. For
custom layouts, use `useSessionRealtime`, `useRealtimeModelSelection`,
`RealtimeVoiceControl`, and `RealtimeModelPickerMenu`; the batteries-included
wrappers remain the recommended path. Concurrent catalog reads are deduplicated
per client and workspace, and successful results are reused for a short bounded
window so embedded controls can remount without refetching.

The reference consumer is `demo/realtime.html`. Run `bun run demo` from
`packages/react`, then open `http://localhost:3100/realtime.html?mode=mock` for
deterministic selection/start/mute/stop/reconnect/error testing. Use
`?mode=live&workspaceId=…&sessionId=…` against the web server's same-origin
`/demo-api` proxy for a real local OpenGeni environment. Configure
`OPENGENI_DEMO_API_URL` and, only on the server, optional demo API/access
credentials; the browser receives neither credential. Prefer the deployment's
normal browser authentication. If the proxy needs a server credential, create a
dedicated tenant-scoped, least-privilege key for the reference demo and never
reuse a deployment-wide runtime secret. Helm deployments can mount a Secret
containing only `api-key` and/or `access-key` with
`web.demoApiCredentialsSecret`; those values are mounted read-only rather than
exposed as container environment variables. Local non-Kubernetes servers may
instead use `OPENGENI_DEMO_API_KEY` and/or `OPENGENI_DEMO_ACCESS_KEY`.

The container-responsive reference is `demo/composer-responsive.html`. It keeps
the browser viewport wide while resizing one child composer through 280, 320,
360, 420, 640, and 768px, with theme, density, paused, voice, model-menu, and
slash-command states available from the harness controls.

Microphone capture works on `localhost` or a secure HTTPS origin. A remote HTTP
deployment cannot request microphone access. The live page exercises catalog
loading, realtime-first creation, Codex Live, Gateway models, mute, recovery,
delegation/context timeline updates, structured questions, and stop/restart
through published package APIs only.

## Browser and computer surfaces (`@opengeni/react/interaction`)

The interaction subpath renders the same browser-native and semantic computer
surfaces used by the OpenGeni web app. It consumes only the public SDK client:
workspace discovery, peer switching, tabs/windows, live frames, human input,
identity versions, interventions, diagnostics, reconnect, and lifecycle state do
not require app-private controller glue.

A managed browser's attachment authority error keeps a same-browser **Reconnect**
action available. It obtains a fresh server-authorized attachment without creating
a replacement browser or replaying input. The fresh Connected Chrome instruction
is reserved for the selected extension-attached browser's generation loss; a
different lost browser in the workspace cannot change that recovery path.

The browser viewer negotiates bounded typing batches from the active controller's
short-lived attachment. Supporting helpers recheck the original controller,
target, document and frame fence before every action; old helpers retain one
request per action. Only queued text actions share a request (at most 16), with
each text/input event preserved. Keys, pointer input and clipboard operations
remain ordering barriers. A failed or uncertain action discards the queued suffix
without replay.
IME candidate-selection keys stay local to the viewer; only committed text is
sent to the remote page. A later ordinary Enter remains a remote key action.
Live image props use opaque byte buffers so React development timing diagnostics
cannot expand and retain every screenshot byte. Normal timing diagnostics remain enabled.
Queued inputs retain only immutable frame fences, not screenshot bytes or prior
render callbacks. Replacing the selected viewer invalidates its queued suffix.

```tsx
import { OpenGeniProvider } from "@opengeni/react";
import { BrowserViewer, ComputerViewer } from "@opengeni/react/interaction";

<OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
  <BrowserViewer
    sessionId={sessionId}
    onOpenComputer={(computerSessionId) => setSelectedComputer(computerSessionId)}
  />
  {selectedComputer ? (
    <ComputerViewer
      sessionId={sessionId}
      requestedComputerSessionId={selectedComputer}
      requestedComputerRequestId={selectedComputer}
    />
  ) : null}
</OpenGeniProvider>;
```

`BrowserViewer` follows the current agent until the human pins another workspace
browser. A headed managed browser can receive `createLinkedComputer`; the
returned ComputerSession must be the exact placement/window the browser uses.
`onOpenComputer` then changes the host layout to that resource—it must not open a
lookalike desktop. Closing either viewer never ends its durable resource.

Native dropdown popups may not appear in page frames. With a controller that
advertises focused input observations, clicking one opens its choices beside
the click. Ordinary clicks use a bounded focus probe instead of a full page
snapshot; only a focused native dropdown (or a child-frame focus hint) requests
semantic options. **Choose option** remains an explicit fallback for older
controllers and controls that cannot be identified automatically. Selection uses the
normal browser action API. The viewer retains that
observation's target/document/frame fence. Private, oversized, or ambiguous
choices remain unavailable; the page's keyboard controls still work. This
fallback requires a controller with focused native-select metadata support and
does not rewrite the page or capture the desktop.

The provider opens one shared workspace interaction-revision stream and every
catalog refreshes only when its revision advances; hidden or disconnected pages
fall back to bounded polling and reconcile from the retained cursor. Hosts that
do not use `OpenGeniProvider` may pass the same structural `client` and
`workspaceId` directly.

Run `bun run demo` and open `browser.html` or `computer.html`. Their `mode=mock`
paths are deterministic; `mode=live&workspaceId=…&sessionId=…` uses the
same-origin `/demo-api` proxy and the exact published SDK/React entrypoints.

## Composer customization (`@opengeni/react/composer`)

`SessionChrome` accepts `onComposerFocus` for queue editing. Connect it to
`controller.focusInput` from `useChatComposerController`, or focus a custom
input through its ref. Chrome calls it after a successful checkout and
`composer.applyDraft`, including confirmed draft replacement; failed checkout
and pending/cancelled replacement do not request focus. The host retains
ownership of the input and no DOM selector or global focus event is needed.

When sharing `useSessionEvents().events` with `useGoal`, the hook still fetches
the authoritative goal on mount and target changes, even when the supplied log
already contains goal events. The shared log drives subsequent invalidations
without opening another event stream. A 404 remains a normal goal-less state.

Use `ChatComposer` for the standard layout and its `controlsStart`, `header`,
and `messages` props for small additions. For a different layout, import the
headless controller and compound primitives as a namespace. The controller is
the one behavior path for keyboard routing, guarded queue/steer submission,
attachments, commands, pause/resume, focus, confirmations, and feedback.

```tsx
import * as Composer from "@opengeni/react/composer";

function InsertTranscript() {
  const composer = Composer.useChatComposer();
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        const separator = composer.value.trim().length > 0 ? " " : "";
        composer.setValue(`${composer.value}${separator}Transcribed text`);
        composer.focusInput();
      }}
    >
      Insert transcript
    </button>
  );
}

function CustomComposer({ sessionComposer, attachments, effectiveControl }) {
  const controller = Composer.useChatComposerController({
    delivery: sessionComposer,
    draft: sessionComposer,
    control: sessionComposer,
    attachments,
    effectiveControl,
  });

  return (
    <Composer.Root controller={controller} responsiveBasis="container">
      <Composer.Frame>
        <Composer.CommandPalette />
        <Composer.Surface>
          <Composer.PausedState />
          <Composer.RestoredResources />
          <Composer.Attachments />
          <Composer.Input />
          {controller.confirmState ? (
            <Composer.Confirmation />
          ) : (
            <Composer.Footer>
              <Composer.Controls>
                <Composer.AttachButton />
                <InsertTranscript />
              </Composer.Controls>
              <Composer.Actions>
                <Composer.PauseButton />
                <Composer.SendButton />
              </Composer.Actions>
            </Composer.Footer>
          )}
        </Composer.Surface>
      </Composer.Frame>
      <Composer.Help />
      <Composer.Status />
    </Composer.Root>
  );
}
```

For a pre-session or otherwise limited composer, pass only `delivery`; `draft`
and `control` are optional capabilities rather than no-op requirements. Custom
controls should call `controller.submit("queue" | "steer")` (or read it through
`useChatComposer`) instead of calling a delivery adapter directly, so upload,
disabled, in-flight, and slash-command guards stay intact. Accessory-local UI
state remains application-owned; durable draft and session state remain in
`useComposer`.

## Hooks

- `useSessionEvents(sessionId)` — loads a compact, bounded tail window by
  default, then live-streams on the SDK's exactly-once/ordered event delivery.
  Initial replay is capped at three 5000-row raw pages and `loadOlder` at two;
  timeline group density is only an early stop. It returns the raw windowed
  `events`, projected `timeline`, latest `sessionStatus`, connection state, and
  older-history controls (`hasOlder`, `loadingOlder`, `loadOlder`). Pass
  `replay: "full"` to opt back into full replay; a nonzero `after` keeps the
  previous resume semantics. `loadOlder()` remains await-compatible and resolves
  to the existing `boolean`, while its promise also carries the causal
  `committed` receipt used by `MessageTimeline`. Pass it directly or through an
  existing wrapper, including `onLoadOlder={() => void loadOlder()}`; synchronous
  receipt capture preserves the commit signal without narrowing the historical
  callback return type. Custom loaders can use `createOlderHistoryLoadReceipt`
  and call `markCommitted` immediately before publishing their accepted older
  window.
- Browser retention limits are exported as `SESSION_EVENT_BROWSER_MAX_BYTES`
  and `SESSION_EVENT_BROWSER_MAX_COUNT`; they do not change fetch page sizes.
  Live appends reuse the retained window's byte total, measuring only incoming
  and evicted events. History still pages when either retention limit is reached.
- Newer history uses `hasNewer`, `loadingNewer`, and `loadNewer`. A failed
  `loadNewer()` preserves the retained events and cursors, exposes the original
  failure through `error`, and still rejects for the caller to handle. Pass
  `onLoadNewer={loadNewer}` (or return its promise from your wrapper) to
  `MessageTimeline`: it catches the request failure, shows the error and an
  explicit **Retry later activity** action, and does not automatically retry
  the failed boundary. A successful retry, jump to the start/latest window,
  or session change clears that failure. Loading older rows alone does not
  resolve a failed newer read. Late failures from a previous session are ignored.
  A host that discards the promise must handle its own rejected request.
- `useComposer(sessionId, { sendExtras, effectiveControl })` — revisioned private
  draft, Send, Steer, and workstream Pause/Resume state. `send()` appends in
  visible queue order (including while paused); `steer()` puts the new direction
  directly in chat and supersedes the current direction. Resume is always an
  explicit control action and never an implicit side effect of Send. Drafts
  autosave with optimistic concurrency, survive failed sends, and reuse one
  `clientEventId` across retries so the server dedupes. Draft reads retry transient
  failures, including request timeouts, with backoff. Successful refreshes clear
  draft-read errors without dismissing Send, Steer, or control errors; a draft
  sync timeout does not mean the agent turn has stopped. `composer.policy` and
  `setModel` / `setReasoningEffort` / `setLatencyMode` expose the exact policy
  owned by that actor/session draft; policy is `null` until hydration completes.
  `sendExtras` (object or function evaluated at send time) is only for
  non-policy per-message fields such as live attachment resources and connection
  authority. Disabling durable draft persistence requires an explicit
  `initialPolicy`; no session or workspace fallback is invented. All human input
  is plain chat text by design; approvals flow as control events
  (`useSessionControl`), not bespoke widgets.
- `useTurnQueue(sessionId, { events })` — the one server-authoritative human
  prompt queue with `moveTurn`, crash-safe `editTurn`, identity-preserving
  `steerTurn`, and `removeTurn`. Mutations carry observed revisions and conflicts
  refetch server truth. Live-updates on `turn.*` and `session.queue.*` events — pass the
  `events` log from `useSessionEvents` to reuse its stream, or let it tail the
  session itself. Providerless self-streams reconcile authoritative queue/draft
  state after the SSE connection opens, closing the initial-read handoff race.
- `useGoal(sessionId, { events })` — goal state + autonomy counters
  (`autoContinuations`, `noProgressStreak`) with `pause(rationale?)` /
  `resume()`. Goal-less sessions yield `goal: null`. Live-updates on `goal.*`
  events.
- `useSessionControl(sessionId)` — durable `pause(reason?)` / `resume(reason?)`
  workstream controls and `approve`/`reject(approvalId, message?)` for
  `requires_action` approvals. Pause is recursive control state, not lifecycle
  status or queue work; Resume creates no message.
- `useSession(sessionId)` — fetch one session (optional polling) with
  `updateTitle(title)` (rename) and live title-patching on `session.title_set`.
- `useFileAttachments()` — the composer's attach flow: stages files, drives the
  SDK's direct-to-blob upload, and yields the `resources` to send with a message.
- `useAvailableModels()` — the deployment's provider-grouped selectable `models`
  plus the `defaultModel` to preselect (from the client config) for a picker.
- `useCodexAccounts()` — connected Codex (ChatGPT) accounts, the active/next-run
  pointer, and per-session account pinning for multi-account subscriptions.
- `useSlashCommands(...)` — the slash-command palette state (registry + parsing +
  handlers) behind `CommandPalette`.
- `useWorkspaceSessions()` / `useScheduledTasks()` — workspace lists for
  fleet/manager views (optional polling).
- `useVariableSets()` — workspace variable sets with metadata-only generic
  reads and create/update/remove/set/delete operations. Dedicated permissioned
  exact-value reveal is part of the held React/UI train rather than an
  implicit field on ordinary reads.
- `useWorkspaces()` — the caller's workspaces with create/update (client-only;
  not bound to the provider's workspace).
- `useBillingUsage({ accountId?, workspaceId? })` — credit balance + recent
  usage events for billing meters (client-only, optional polling).

All workspace-scoped hooks resolve the client/workspace from
`<OpenGeniProvider>` or accept `{ client, workspaceId }` per call
(`useWorkspaces`/`useBillingUsage` need only the client). They depend on
`SessionClientLike` — a structural slice of `OpenGeniClient` — so proxy-backed
or scripted clients work unchanged.

## Timeline projection

`buildTimeline(events)` is a pure, tested reducer from the raw event log to
renderable items (user/agent messages with streaming flags, tool calls matched
to outputs, `session_create`/`session_send_message` calls promoted to worker
items, sandbox operations with command output, goal markers, status changes,
notices). User messages carry their attached `resources` and requested `tools`
so consumers can render attachment chips. `groupTimeline` clusters consecutive
activity for collapsed display. Use them directly if you want custom rendering
with the same semantics.

Failed worker items may also carry `failure: { code, message }`. The projection
accepts only the bounded structured orchestration envelope retained in MCP
output; it does not reinterpret arbitrary legacy error strings. `ActivityRail`
renders the code and message directly beneath the failed worker row.

### Compatibility

The projection is a tolerant reader over `SessionEvent.payload` because the wire
contract intentionally keeps payloads open. Unknown event types and unknown or
malformed fields are ignored, never fatal. The golden event-grammar suite in
`test/golden` is the compatibility contract for how existing durable logs render;
intentional changes should regenerate those snapshots and review the diff.

## Components

- `ChatComposer` — auto-growing textarea, Enter-to-send (IME-safe), direct
  Cmd/Ctrl+Enter steering, pause/resume controls, and inline finite error
  recovery. Paused sends visibly join the queue without resuming. Slots for app chrome:
  `controlsStart` (footer controls like model pickers / attach buttons),
  `header` (e.g. attachment chips above the field), and `onPaste`
  (paste-image-to-attach). Its advanced controller and compound primitives are
  exported from `@opengeni/react/composer`.
- `MessageTimeline` — the session timeline with stick-to-bottom scrolling, a
  "jump to latest" affordance, streaming caret, collapsible activity clusters,
  and worker cards (wire `onOpenSession` to drill into a worker). Pass
  `renderMessageText` to plug a markdown renderer. Pass
  `loadRetainedArtifact` to render permanent generated-image receipts; a loader
  may return verified bytes or a short-lived signed URL. The stock web app uses
  the URL path to avoid copying multi-megabyte images into JavaScript memory.
- `UserMessageBody` — the shared lossless rendered-height disclosure for
  already-sent user text. Use it inside a custom `renderMessageText` user branch
  so attachments and voice identity remain outside the clipped Markdown region.
  Pass `disclosureLabels={{ showMore: "Afficher davantage", showLess: "Réduire" }}`
  to localize a direct instance. For the default timeline, pass the same object
  as `MessageTimeline.userMessageDisclosureLabels` or
  `SessionConversation.userMessageDisclosureLabels`; custom `UserMessageBody`
  renderers inside that timeline inherit these labels too. Each direct label
  overrides its timeline label independently, then falls back to `Show more`
  or `Show less`. Changing labels does not reset a message's expanded state.
  `UserMessageDisclosureLabels` is exported from both `@opengeni/react` and
  `@opengeni/react/session-ui`.
- `SessionStatus` / `StatusDot` — status badges; live states breathe.
- `FleetTile` — one session in a fleet grid: title, status, model, recency.
- `ModelPicker` — a compact model dropdown for a composer slot, grouping the
  host-exposed models by provider.
- `ModelPolicyPicker` — the full model policy control used by the OpenGeni web
  app: provider/billing rails, model availability, reasoning effort, and
  runnable latency modes such as Fast. It accepts either `ClientModel[]` or
  catalog-backed `PickerModelRow[]`, and supports host-supplied labels.
- `Markdown` — the timeline's markdown renderer (GFM), also usable standalone.
  Top-level assistant tables in `MessageTimeline` can expand beyond the prose
  column into the actual conversation panel's available space. Small tables,
  paragraphs, user bubbles, and nested or standalone Markdown keep their normal
  width; oversized tables retain table-only horizontal scrolling. No host prop
  or viewport-wide layout override is required.
  With `onSandboxFile`, a valid `sandbox:<path>[:line]` application link becomes
  an in-session Open action. The callback receives the decoded path unchanged;
  the optional line is positive and 1-based. Invalid sandbox references render
  as disabled text, never as empty or browser-navigation links.
- `CommandPalette` — the slash-command palette UI over `useSlashCommands`.

`SandboxWorkspace.openFileRequest` is the host seam for that callback. Each new
`requestId` selects Files, opens the exact path on the already selected session
target, reveals its loaded/lazy ancestors in the file tree, selects and scrolls
to the file, and optionally focuses the requested line. A request without a line
opens the top of the file; file publication/download remains a separate explicit
artifact action.

The timeline is extensible: `createToolRegistry` / `defaultToolRegistry` plug
per-tool renderers, and the rendering primitives (`ActivityDisclosure`,
`ScreenshotFigure`, `TermBlock`, `LightboxProvider`, …) compose custom rows with
the same semantics.

Collapsed turn summaries can also be customized per `MessageTimeline` instance.
Omit `turnSummary` to keep the built-in facets unchanged, use `add`/`remove` for
small modifications, or `replace` for a complete ordered summary:

```tsx
import type { TurnSummaryFacet } from "@opengeni/react";

const updatedRecordsFacet: TurnSummaryFacet = {
  id: "updated-records",
  summarize: ({ toolCalls }) => {
    const count = toolCalls.filter((call) => call.name === "records.update").length;
    return count > 0 ? { content: `${count} records updated` } : null;
  },
};

<MessageTimeline
  items={timeline}
  turnSummary={{
    facets: {
      remove: ["memories"],
      add: [updatedRecordsFacet],
    },
  }}
/>;
```

Custom facets receive an immutable normalized activity snapshot, including
ordered tool arguments, outputs, status, and timing. Added facets follow the
remaining built-ins in supplied order. Duplicate IDs keep their first
definition; remove a built-in before adding a custom facet with the same ID.
`replace` is type-exclusive with `add` and `remove`.

`turnSummary={{ rolling: true }}` selects the readable per-turn presentation:
startup shows the preparation orb outside any disclosure, then hands over to
Working without resetting the startup-inclusive elapsed clock. While work is
live, assistant progress messages stay fully formatted and visible,
followed by one Working or Waiting disclosure with the rolling latest step.
When the turn finishes, earlier assistant messages and tools share the Worked
disclosure; the final response remains visible. Expanding reveals that turn's
earlier prose and activity in chronological order, not a fold of multiple turns.
An already expanded or actively read view is preserved through settlement.
Routine machine inputs get one compact reason per resumed turn. Normal tip-follow
continues through long answers, and manual scrolling never auto-repins on new work.
Expanded outer work headers stay reachable at the top of the timeline (below
Latest question when shown) until their own details end; nested headers never stick.

Wire the newest-question resolver when history can be unloaded:

`SessionConversation` includes the readable-turn presentation and this wiring automatically.

```tsx
const events = useSessionEvents(sessionId);
<MessageTimeline
  events={events.events}
  items={events.timeline}
  turnSummary={{ rolling: true }}
  hasNewer={events.hasNewer}
  onJumpToLatest={events.jumpToLatest}
  onJumpToLatestQuestion={events.jumpToLatestQuestion}
/>;
```

The single **Latest question** button targets the newest durable user message,
not the viewport-relative question or the newest message in an older loaded page.
The resolver checks the authoritative queue and normally uses one filtered forensic
lookup plus, if needed, two bounded context reads. It pages past legacy worker
completions and withdrawn/cancelled-before-start prompts, never substituting an
arbitrary question from a loaded old page. Queued/legacy admission uses filtered
lifecycle evidence to locate its real turn start. A distant prompt is retained as
one projection-only witness in `events.timeline`; `events.events` remains the
bounded contiguous raw window, so pass `items` as above.
The optional resolver loads on the first click, not when opening a session.
Identity and navigation guards also cover that module-loading delay.

`SessionConversation` also opens and focuses the newest pending prompt in
`SessionChrome`. Custom hosts can provide the same destination without changing
the existing `Promise<number | null>` timeline callback:

```tsx
onJumpToLatestQuestion={() => events.jumpToLatestQuestion({
  onQueuedQuestion: async (turn, navigation) => {
    await queue.refresh();
    if (!navigation.isCurrent()) return;
    // Check the host's latest queue/error state before applying its focus request.
    setQueueFocusTarget((previous) => ({
      turnId: turn.id,
      requestId: (previous?.requestId ?? 0) + 1,
    }));
  },
})}
// Pass queueFocusTarget to SessionChrome; each new request opens/focuses once.
```

A queue destination returns `null`, not an invisible transcript sequence. Without
`onQueuedQuestion`, a pending prompt produces explicit queue guidance in the
timeline; transitional queue state can be retried rather than silently no-oping.
Check `navigation.isCurrent()` after awaits and immediately before queue UI effects:
an explicit history jump can supersede a queued lookup without changing the session.
The shared projection predicate supplies execution evidence for older queued turns
without `turn.started`, including tools, agent/sandbox activity, startup, recovery,
and capacity events. Compact cursor coverage skips coalesced delta runs.
Without `onJumpToLatestQuestion`, local navigation is available only at the live history
window; the component never guesses from an older page. `onJumpToLatest` retains
its separate bottom-follow behavior. `groupTimeline(items)` retains classic
grouping; `{ readableTurns: true }` selects the new projection. The deprecated
`foldExchanges` option aliases readable turns, not the removed cross-turn fold. See
[`docs/design/genie-loading.md`](../../docs/design/genie-loading.md).

## Sandbox surfacing

An opt-in workbench that surfaces a session's live sandbox — files, terminal,
diff, and (when available) a desktop pixel stream — driven by a negotiated
capability document so every surface degrades to a reason instead of crashing.

- `useSessionCapabilities(sessionId, { attachDesktop?, attachTerminal?, attachFiles? })`
  — negotiates the per-session capability doc, tracks lease liveness
  (`cold`/`warming`/`warm`), and acquires the viewer holder(s) that keep the box
  warm. Opening `DesktopViewer` engages the desktop immediately and records any
  required un-redacted/shared acknowledgment automatically before attaching.
- `useSandboxFiles` / `useSandboxGit` — the Pierre file tree + git status/diff
  feeds. Initial and refresh reads use the SDK's batched file-frontier and
  multi-repository Git queries behind one sandbox lease; `fs.changed` /
  `git.changed` notifications keep the result live.
- `useSandboxTerminal` / `useTerminalStream` — the read-only command-output
  firehose and the real interactive PTY over the minted `pty-ws` cell.
- `useDesktopStream` — the noVNC socket, hot-swapped on box rollover via
  `stream.url.rotated`.
- Components: `WorkspaceDock` (the resizable/collapsible right-hand dock with a
  vertical activity rail, persistent visited panels, and a panel-local Hide action),
  `FileBrowser` / `SandboxFiles`, `DiffView` / `PierreDiff` / `PierreFile`,
  `CodeEditor`, `SandboxTerminal`, and `DesktopViewer`.

These surfaces pull in [optional peer dependencies](#optional-peer-dependencies)
— install only the ones for surfaces you actually mount.

`SandboxWorkspace` keeps capture-backed file browsing passive, but an explicit
live-file open acquires a viewer. Failed opens show the connection error and a
retry that renegotiates the viewer instead of leaving a waking spinner running.
When composing `SandboxFiles` directly, pass `workspaceError` alongside
`liveWorkspaceReady` and supply an `onWakeWorkspace` callback that can retry a
failed negotiation. Complete PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP reads render as read-only
image previews; truncated reads and other binary formats remain non-editable
notices. Image previews use the existing bounded file-read path and do not
publish or retain additional files.

## Connected Machines (`@opengeni/react/machines`)

Bring-your-own-compute UI: the Machines dashboard, per-machine metrics, the
active-sandbox swap, and the enrollment flow. Imported from the
`@opengeni/react/machines` subpath so consumers that never surface machines
never pull it in.

- `useMachines({ sessionId? })` — polls the fleet, exposes `attach(sandboxId)`
  (wired to the SDK's active-sandbox swap when a `sessionId` is in scope),
  `fetchSeries`, and the `activeSandboxId` / `activeEpoch` pointer.
- `MachinesDashboard` / `MachineCard` / `MachineMetrics` — the fleet grid with
  per-machine meters and an attach/swap affordance.
- `MachineDockBar` / `SharedMachineDisclosure` — the backend-aware bar over the
  sandbox dock naming which machine (Modal box or your machine) it is bound to.
- `EnrollmentDeviceFlow` — the in-session device-flow panel (`userCode` +
  `verificationUri`, pending → authorized/denied/expired).
- `EnrollmentConsent` — the loud whole-machine approve page.
- `MachineStatusPill` / `ConnectionStatusPill` / `ConnectionDot` — status chips,
  plus the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MetricSample` view-model types.

```tsx
import {
  MACHINES_SESSION_POLL_MS,
  MachinesDashboard,
  useMachines,
} from "@opengeni/react/machines";

function Fleet({ sessionId }: { sessionId: string }) {
  const { machines, activeSandboxId, attach, attachingSandboxId, refresh } =
    useMachines({ sessionId, pollIntervalMs: MACHINES_SESSION_POLL_MS });
  return (
    <MachinesDashboard
      machines={machines}
      activeSandboxId={activeSandboxId}
      attachingSandboxId={attachingSandboxId}
      onAttach={(m) => attach(m.sandboxId)}
      onRefresh={refresh}
    />
  );
}
```

See the [Connected Machines guide](../../docs/connected-machines.md) for the
end-to-end embedder story (create-on-machine, discover, swap, enroll, revoke).

## Optional peer dependencies

The chat/timeline surface has none. The sandbox workspace and diff surfaces pull
their heavy libraries from **optional** `peerDependencies`, so you install only
what the surfaces you mount need:

- Terminal (`SandboxTerminal`): `@xterm/xterm`, `@xterm/addon-fit`,
  `@xterm/addon-web-links`.
- Desktop (`DesktopViewer`): `@novnc/novnc`.
- Diff (`DiffView` / `PierreDiff` / `PierreFile`): `@pierre/diffs`.
- Code editor (`CodeEditor`): `@uiw/react-codemirror` + the `@codemirror/lang-*`
  language packs you need (`css`, `html`, `javascript`, `json`, `markdown`,
  `python`).

## Demo harness

`bun run demo` (from this package) serves a harness that drives the real hooks
and components against a scripted mock client — a manager ops-channel narrative
with streaming, tool calls, and a worker spawn, plus fleet and scheduled-task
views and a dark/light toggle. `realtime.html` is the public-package reference
consumer described above, with deterministic mock and same-origin live modes.
`bun run demo:build` is part of the repo gate.

### Model selection

`ModelPolicyPicker` opens a flat, searchable list grouped by payment source, with
the selected model checked in its provider group. Choosing a model applies it and closes the popover.
Thinking and supported speed controls remain in a fixed footer instead of a
nested page. Model changes preserve supported reasoning effort and latency;
unsupported effort falls back to the new model's default, and unsupported speed
returns to Standard. Thinking uses inline radio choices and is hidden when the
model has no adjustable reasoning levels. Availability and Codex-only session restrictions still disable choices.

The trigger renders immediately; the searchable popover loads when opened. Hosts
can translate its search, current-selection, empty-result, attachment-warning, and
thinking labels through `messages`, and override payment descriptions through
`messages.billingHints`.

Hosts can rebrand the full picker without replacing its interaction logic:

```tsx
<ModelPolicyPicker
  {...pickerProps}
  groupPresentation={{
    opengeni_credits: {
      label: "Acme Assist",
      icon: <AcmeMark aria-hidden="true" />,
      description: "Provided by your workspace",
    },
    codex_subscription: { description: null },
  }}
/>
```

`groupPresentation` is a partial map keyed by `PickerBillingClass`. Labels apply
to group headings, search, and trigger-icon accessibility. Icons apply to both
the menu and trigger; supply decorative, non-interactive content (SVG or image)
that fits the existing 14px slot. Explicit `null` hides an icon or description;
omitted fields retain defaults. Descriptions override `messages.billingHints`,
can also be shown for the deployment-provided group, and are searchable. Existing
`rows[].billingClassLabel` remains the fallback when no label override is supplied.
This is presentation only: model IDs, billing, ordering, availability and callbacks
are unchanged. The type `ModelPolicyPickerGroupPresentation` is exported from
both `@opengeni/react` and `@opengeni/react/composer`. The native `ModelPicker`
is a separate control; this API targets the full `ModelPolicyPicker` shown above.

For a rendered example, open the composer-responsive demo with `?branding=host`.

Subscription descriptions appear once per provider group. Free models carry a
Free badge. Pass `hasImageAttachments` for the current draft to show an image
compatibility warning only when the selected model cannot view those images.

`MessageTimeline.renderMessageActions(item)` places host-owned controls beside
Copy and the timestamp for user messages and completed assistant messages.
The host owns feedback, fork authorization, and mutations; streaming assistant
messages omit this slot. Use the `group/copy` hover/focus state and preserve
visible touch targets when styling actions.
