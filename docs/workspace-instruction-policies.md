# Workspace instruction policies

Workspace instruction policies provide a dedicated, auditable backend control
plane for versioned workspace charters and policies. They are intentionally
separate from `workspace_model_policies`: instruction governance does not choose
models, providers, tools, integrations, or Linear behavior.

The backend remains the sole charter/policy authority. Migration
`0157_session_policy_role_snapshots.sql` adds the runtime delivery layer: an
immutable session policy-role binding, accepted-turn policy snapshots, and
deterministic composition with the existing structured preference registry.
It does not create another policy, preference, memory, document, or skills
store.

## Targets and normalization

Each immutable revision addresses exactly one target:

- one workspace charter: `kind=charter`, `scope=global`, `roleKey=null`;
- one global workspace policy: `kind=policy`, `scope=global`, `roleKey=null`;
- a role policy: `kind=policy`, `scope=role`, with one normalized role key.

Role keys are identifiers, not display names. Contract ingress applies Unicode
NFKC normalization, trims the value, lowercases it, replaces whitespace runs
with `-`, and collapses repeated `-` characters. PostgreSQL accepts only the
already-normalized `[a-z0-9._-]` identifier form, up to 64 characters. A nullable
role key is valid only for global targets.

## Immutable revisions and provenance

Migration `0130_workspace_instruction_policies.sql` adds dedicated
`workspace_instruction_policy_*` storage:

- `workspace_instruction_policy_revisions` is append-only revision history;
- `workspace_instruction_policy_heads` is the mutable active-head projection;
- `workspace_instruction_policy_activation_events` is append-only audit history.

Migration `0168_workspace_instruction_policy_operation_receipts.sql` adds
immutable request fingerprints for natural-convergence replay. Migration
`0169_workspace_instruction_policy_onboarding_proposals.sql` adds immutable
onboarding evidence that references exactly one inactive authoritative revision.

Revision numbers come from one monotonic PostgreSQL sequence. The server computes
the SHA-256 hash of the exact UTF-8 content, and PostgreSQL independently checks
that the stored hash matches. A revision may identify a superseded revision only
inside the same workspace and exact target. Runtime writers receive only
`SELECT` and `INSERT` on revisions and activation events; PostgreSQL mutation
guards reject updates or deletes even through a privileged application path.

Every revision records its creator, creation time, optional superseded revision,
and one provenance source:

- `human`;
- `onboarding`;
- `knowledge_proposal`;
- `legacy_import`.

The optional provenance source identifier is evidence about where the content
came from. The legacy-import operation does not trust a caller-provided label: it
uses the fixed source `workspaces.agent_instructions`.

## Draft-only onboarding proposals

An onboarding proposal is evidence for one suggested charter, global policy, or
normalized role policy. It does not create another prompt, Memory, preference,
Documents, or knowledge authority. One transaction:

1. locks the workspace and checks the exact target's active-head baseline;
2. fences the operation ID against every instruction-policy mutation kind;
3. converges the natural `(source id, source version, target, baseline
   activation version)` identity;
4. creates a normal inactive instruction-policy revision with `onboarding`
   provenance and the immutable proposal UUID as its provenance source ID; and
5. appends the immutable proposal evidence with bounded source/version,
   confidence basis points, actor, baseline, request fingerprint, and timestamp.

The caller must supply both the expected current revision ID and activation
version (`null` and `0` only when the target has never had a head). An inactive
target retains a revision-free boundary with its latest positive activation
version in the additive deactivation ledger, which callers obtain from the
bounded `inactiveHeads` list projection.
A changed boundary returns
`WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_ONBOARDING_PROPOSAL_STALE`. Reusing the same
source version for the same target with different content or confidence
returns `WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_ONBOARDING_PROPOSAL_CONFLICT`.

A *different baseline* is deliberately not a conflict. One knowledge proposal
may own more than one inactive instruction-policy proposal, at most one per
baseline activation version. This exists for a single case: the head moved
after a human already confirmed a rule, and `remember_confirm` rebaselines onto
the current head rather than discarding their answer. The successor reuses the
exact immutable source facts, so the human's confirmation - which is bound to
the knowledge proposal ID, not the instruction-policy proposal - still
describes precisely what activates. Activation resolves the live head first and
selects the proposal bound to it; when no candidate matches, the stale boundary
is raised so the confirm path can rebaseline again.

Empty and oversized content use the typed `..._EMPTY` and `..._OVERSIZED`
responses. Exact operation replay returns the original proposal; changed input
under that operation ID returns `WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_OPERATION_REUSED`.
The compare-and-set baseline is not part of that identity: it is staleness
detection at write time, so an ordinary turn-recovery replay of the same
operation ID stays idempotent even when the head moved underneath it.

The proposal table is append-only, uses `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and receives
only `SELECT`/`INSERT` runtime privileges. PostgreSQL validates that its linked
revision has the same tenant, target, actor, content fingerprint, and exact
`onboarding` provenance. Proposal creation never writes a head or activation
event, and there is intentionally no proposal activation endpoint.

## Knowledge-backed inactive proposals

The governed Company Brain write adapter reuses the same immutable proposal and
inactive-revision lifecycle for workspace-scoped Knowledge evidence. It requires
an exact `knowledge_change_proposals` row, exact supporting claim/evidence,
explicit target, and caller-supplied active-head revision/version baseline. Its
draft records `knowledge_proposal` provenance with the Knowledge proposal UUID
as source ID; the proposal source version is the exact content hash.

Because it inherits that lifecycle, it also inherits the per-baseline proposal
identity described above: one Knowledge proposal may own more than one inactive
instruction-policy proposal, at most one per baseline activation version, which
is what lets `remember_confirm` rebaseline a human's confirmation onto a head
that moved underneath it.

Migration `0255_company_brain_governed_write_proposals.sql` extends the existing
database validator to require that the Knowledge proposal has workspace scope,
the same workspace, `instruction_policy` target kind, exact normalized target
key, `proposed` status, and the same content hash as the inactive draft. The
original onboarding branch remains unchanged. This adapter has no API route and
cannot write a head or activation event; activation and rollback remain in the
existing authenticated human lifecycle.

## Activation, conflicts, and rollback

At most one head may exist for each charter, global policy, or normalized role
policy target. Partial unique indexes enforce those cardinalities. Head and event
triggers require the workspace, target, revision number, and content hash to
identify the exact immutable revision.

Activation and rollback are one transaction. The transaction locks the
workspace row before reading a head, which serializes both initial activation
when no head exists and later changes. The caller supplies the revision it
expects to be current (`null` for a first activation). A stale expectation
returns the typed `WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_CONFLICT` response with the
current head; it never silently overwrites another activation.

Each successful change advances the target's activation version and atomically
writes the head plus an immutable event containing:

- activation or rollback type;
- actor subject and bounded reason;
- old revision id, number, and content hash, when a head existed;
- new revision id, number, and content hash;
- activation version and timestamp.

Migration `0269_governed_learning_activation_controller.sql` adds one narrow
service-only compensation operation for an instruction policy activated from a
final governed-learning `automatic` receipt. It cannot be called as the generic
human lifecycle and does not change human activation or rollback. Exact undo is
CAS-fenced to the controller's still-current activation. When that activation
replaced no prior head, the operation removes only that exact active head and
appends a durable monotonic `automatic_deactivate` boundary in an additive
history whose shape does not weaken the legacy activation-event contract.
Canonical accepted-turn reconstruction
treats that later boundary as no active policy; the automatic activation remains
in history and no evidence is deleted. A later human or automatic activation
must CAS against the inactive boundary and continues the target's monotonic
version sequence.

The cutover remains rolling-compatible: the legacy head table keeps its
non-null shape and contains no row while a target is inactive, so old readers
cannot surface a tombstone as active. A pre-0269 writer that omits the activation
version still computes version 1 for that absent row, which conflicts with the
target's immutable historical version-1 activation event and rolls back before
it can recreate a head. New writers read the additive boundary and continue at
the exact next version.

Rollback never mutates history. Its target must be a revision that was previously
active for the same target, and rollback creates a new activation event and a new
head version.

## HTTP and SDK surface

The API and `OpenGeniClient` expose:

- list revision history, active heads, bounded per-target inactive boundaries,
  legacy activation events, and additive deactivation events;
- get one revision;
- create a draft;
- import the stored legacy override as a draft;
- diff two revisions of the same target;
- activate a revision;
- roll back to a previously active revision.

They also expose list/create onboarding proposals below
`/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/instruction-policies/onboarding-proposals`. Listing
requires `workspace:read`; creating an inactive proposal requires
`workspace:admin`.

The routes live below
`/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/instruction-policies`. List, get, and diff require
`workspace:read`. Draft creation, legacy import, activation, and rollback require
`workspace:admin`.

The agent-facing `instruction_policy_save` surface is deliberately an edit
contract rather than a complete-document save. The agent must read the active
content and exact baseline before every change, then choose one mode:

- `append` is the normal mode for a new rule. It preserves the active content
  byte-for-byte and inserts only the blank-line separator needed before the new
  text;
- `edit` replaces one exact `oldText` occurrence with `newText`, which may be
  empty for a removal. A missing, repeated, or complete-document anchor fails
  closed.

Agents cannot replace the complete instruction. An authorized human can use the
manual workspace editor when a whole-policy rewrite is genuinely intended.
Every agent mode retains the active-head revision and activation-version
compare-and-set. A stale baseline, invalid edit shape, ambiguous or whole-policy
anchor, or result outside the agent-authored destination budget creates no
revision. During a rolling deployment, an older application request without
`editMode` is accepted only when its proposed content preserves the complete
active instruction byte-for-byte. Unsafe older pending revisions and explicit
replacement revisions cannot be activated after the preservation guard is
installed.

## Session role binding and accepted-turn snapshots

`CreateSessionRequest.policyRole` binds one normalized policy role to the
session. The value is immutable after creation and is deliberately separate
from human workspace membership roles and hierarchical-memory role selectors.
When the binding is absent, runtime keeps the compatibility fallback to a
normalized `session.metadata.role`. An invalid present fallback fails closed to
no role policy; metadata such as `membershipRole` is never consulted.

Each accepted logical turn has one immutable `created_at` boundary. Every exact
execution attempt for that turn installs or replays one
`workspace_instruction_policy_snapshots` row containing at most:

1. the active workspace charter;
2. the active global policy;
3. the active policy matching the session policy role.

The snapshot is reconstructed from immutable activation events at the accepted
turn boundary and records exact revision IDs, hashes, activation versions,
activation timestamps, bounded provenance, role source, canonical ordering,
and one aggregate hash. A policy activated after a turn was queued cannot move
that turn; a recovery attempt for the same logical turn resolves the same
accepted state. A newly accepted human turn, goal continuation, system turn, or
compaction receives the then-current state.

Snapshots use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, ownership-parent foreign keys that
cascade only with account/workspace/session/turn/attempt lifecycle deletion,
immutable-history triggers, and SELECT-only application table privileges. One
target-schema-local security-definer function validates the exact active
session/turn/attempt/generation and is the only runtime insert path.

## Runtime composition and precedence

For an exact attempt, the worker combines the account company-profile snapshot,
policy snapshot, and existing preference-registry descriptor snapshot.
Automatic model context follows this order after the non-bypassable platform
CORE:

1. organization company profile, when active;
2. organization preference descriptors;
3. workspace charter;
4. workspace global policy;
5. workspace preference descriptors;
6. immutable initiating-user preference descriptors;
7. matching session role policy;
8. durable session instructions;
9. selected skills and repository/tool substrate;
10. bounded retrieved memory/knowledge.

Per-message `modelContext` is outside this authority block. It enters only as ordinary chronological user-role content attached to its accepted message and cannot modify governance or the persistent instruction prefix.

The company profile is the separate account-scoped authority documented in
[`company-profile.md`](company-profile.md). It does not turn company facts into
preferences or widen workspace policy authority. When absent, the prior
policy/preference order and legacy behavior remain byte-for-byte unchanged.

Preference entries are sanitized descriptors only. Full content remains behind
the exact attempt's authorized retrieval handle. Documents, imports, Slack
messages, transcripts, connectors, knowledge results, RAG evidence, and memory
proposals are not prompt-policy authorities and never enter this block unless an
authorized activation first creates an immutable policy or preference revision.

The complete governance block is deterministic and fails closed above 131,072
UTF-8 bytes. Evidence includes snapshot IDs/hashes, revision IDs/hashes,
ordering, role source, descriptor counts, truncation, provenance, and retrieval
handles without copying private full preference content.

## Agent-authored budgets and style

An active policy revision is composed verbatim into the prompt of every session
it applies to, for as long as it stays active. A global charter or global policy
applies to every session in the workspace; a role policy applies to every session
bound to that role. At most three entries compose at once (charter, global
policy, matching role policy). Agent and human instruction writes share the
same storage limit. This lets localized edits preserve existing long policies
without forcing a rewrite. Concise new rules remain the authoring guidance;
the separate 131,072-byte prompt-composition bound is unchanged.

| Author | Surface | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | `instruction_policy_save` supplied text and resulting instruction; legacy `remember`/proposal/promotion paths | `WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS` (262,144; agent compatibility export aliases it) |
| Agent | `remember` lane `preference`, `preference_propose`, `task_note_promote_preference` | `AGENT_AUTHORED_PREFERENCE_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS` (1,200) |
| Human | Workspace State editor, HTTP/SDK policy routes | `WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTION_POLICY_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS` (262,144) |

The constants and the actionable rejection messages live in
[`packages/contracts/src/agent-authored-durable-text.ts`](../packages/contracts/src/agent-authored-durable-text.ts).
The direct proposal surfaces are bounded by the request contracts. Native
instruction edits bound each supplied text and the complete result, so an append
cannot grow the stored instruction past the common limit and no path truncates
content. Rolling migration `0584_agent_instruction_size_parity.sql` updates the
database check without changing exact edits, authorization, review, CAS,
operation identity or the activation-preservation fence. Old applications may
still enforce 600 characters until their binaries are upgraded. Task-note
promotion is bounded in
[`packages/db/src/company-brain-governed-writes.ts`](../packages/db/src/company-brain-governed-writes.ts)
instead, because there the content is the note rather than a request field: a
note is bounded only by `TASK_NOTE_TEXT_MAX_BYTES` and promotion lands in exactly
the same destination materialization as a direct proposal, so without a check
there the note would be a way around the cap. The promotion is rejected rather
than truncated, before any evidence, claim, or proposal row is written; the note
bytes stay exact evidence, and a convergent replay of a promotion that was
already accepted is not re-checked.

The human limit is deliberately unchanged: somebody editing a charter in the UI
is making a deliberate, visible choice, and lowering their limit would reject
text they had already typed. Existing stored revisions are never rewritten, and a
legacy import stays byte-identical; only new agent writes are bounded.

The style rule the tool descriptions state, and the one to keep in prose and
prompts consistent with:

- write one imperative rule in 1-3 sentences;
- no numbered procedure, no examples, no rationale essay, no restating of
  platform defaults;
- prefer several small rules over one long one, each a separate revision;
- keep procedure in a Document or Skill and have the rule reference it.

A Skill is bounded for a different reason, and the wording matters because
the naive one is wrong: shortening a preference's content does **not** shrink any
prompt. Only its short title and description descriptors are composed; the full
content stays behind the exact attempt's retrieval handle. Its length is
therefore retrieval cost rather than standing prompt cost, which is why it gets
more room than a rule rather than less. A Skill should state one trigger and
outcome and include only necessary prerequisites, executable steps, verification,
and important failure handling; background, repetition, generic advice, and
decorative examples are omitted, and unrelated workflows are split. The Knowledge lane keeps the wider
`REMEMBER_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS` (4,000) ceiling because it is retrieval evidence and
never joins the always-composed prefix.

The `remember` confirmation card names the cost before a human agrees to it: its
question label carries the character count and where that text lands. See
[`company-brain-write-routing.md`](company-brain-write-routing.md).

## Legacy compatibility and inactive workspaces

Migration `0130_workspace_instruction_policies.sql` performs no backfill.
Creating or importing a draft does not create an active head.

When an exact attempt has no active policy revision and no active preference
descriptor, structured governance does not participate in prompt composition.
Existing runtime behavior is therefore preserved byte-for-byte:

- a stored `workspaces.agent_instructions` override remains the workspace
  instruction source;
- a workspace without that override continues to use the deployment/default
  persona template behavior;
- no default template is copied into revision storage.

If preference descriptors are active but no charter/policy is active, the
legacy workspace/deployment persona remains the instruction template and the
descriptor block is appended after CORE. Once any charter or policy is active,
the structured policy authority replaces the legacy workspace
`agent_instructions` override for that attempt; the deployment persona still
supplies the generic runtime substrate beneath CORE.

Legacy import reads only the stored `agent_instructions` value and creates one
inactive global charter draft with `legacy_import` provenance. It never imports
or materializes a deployment default, never activates the draft, and never
rewrites the legacy field.

## Isolation and deliberate non-goals

All instruction-policy tables carry account/workspace keys, `FORCE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY`, and the canonical `workspace_isolation` policy. The application role
can mutate only heads; revision, activation, receipt, snapshot, and onboarding
proposal evidence is immutable or append-only according to its exact privilege
class.

This slice deliberately does not implement:

- automatic proposal ingestion or source connectors;
- workspace memory or knowledge ingestion;
- model, tool, integration, or Linear enforcement;
- proposal review/approval state or proposal-specific activation authority;
- broader Workspace State source inventory, export, or governance authoring
  workflows beyond the existing policy backend.
