# Per-session MCP servers

OpenGeni supports third-party MCP servers attached to a single session. This is
for embedding hosts that need per-session tool endpoints and per-session bearer
credentials, without making those servers deployment-global.

## Contract

`CreateSessionRequest.mcpServers` accepts an array of:

- `id`: registry-id shape (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`), unique within the session and not
  colliding with built-ins, deployment MCP servers, or enabled capability MCPs.
- `name`: optional display name.
- `url`: HTTPS MCP endpoint.
- `allowedTools`, `timeoutMs`, `cacheToolsList`: same runtime meaning as
  deployment MCP server settings.
- `requireApproval`: `true` requires approval for every tool, `false` requires
  none, and a string array requires approval only for those unprefixed tool
  names. Selective policies are canonicalized as a sorted set and bounded to
  2,048 names, 256 KiB total UTF-8, and 1 KiB UTF-8 per name.
- `headers`: configured credential headers, authenticated-encrypted at rest.
- `connectionRef`: optional non-secret opaque connection pointer. Standalone
  deployments resolve it through OpenGeni's connection store; embedded hosts
  can resolve the same pointer through `ConnectionCredentialsPort.mcpCredentials`.

Session responses and session events expose only metadata:

```ts
{
  id: string;
  name: string | null;
  url: string;
  headerNames: string[];
  credentialVersion: number;
  requireApproval: boolean | string[];
  connectionRef: McpServerConnectionRef | null;
}
```

Create, list/get, session-event, and ordinary SDK/React projections expose only
metadata. The approved release-held follow-up adds a separate tenant-
scoped exact-plaintext operation requiring the owning resource permission plus
`secrets:read`, with metadata-only audit. That dedicated operation is not
implemented in the current emergency head and is never inferred from an
unrelated session response.

## Permission

Attaching a server at create time and rotating its credentials both require
`mcp_servers:attach`. `workspace:admin` implies it through the normal permission
composition. The worker's default first-party MCP permission set deliberately
does not include `mcp_servers:attach`, so a sandboxed agent cannot attach a new
credentialed server to itself.

An agent-created child is the bounded exception for an already-authorized
server snapshot. If `mcpServers` is omitted, the child copies its trusted
immediate parent's server definitions, policy, connection refs, and encrypted
headers without requiring `mcp_servers:attach`; the parent comes only from the
worker-signed grant and cannot be supplied in the request body. Explicit
`mcpServers`, including an explicit empty array, never inherit and go through the
ordinary attach permission check when non-empty. This delegates existing tool
context without letting a child invent an endpoint or plaintext credential.

### Approval-policy updates

An authorized host can replace one attached server's policy without recreating
the session:

```http
PATCH /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/mcp-servers/:serverId/approval-policy
Content-Type: application/json

{ "requireApproval": ["create_record", "delete_record"] }
```

The route requires `sessions:control` and the
`session.mcp.approval_policy.write` session-authorization operation. The SDK
exposes `OpenGeniClient.updateSessionMcpApprovalPolicy`; React session embeds
can use `useSessionMcpApprovalPolicy`.

The response returns the updated safe server metadata and
`effectiveFrom: "next_attempt"`. The update and attempt claim serialize under
the session lock. A claimed attempt keeps the exact policy snapshot it started
with; the next attempt captures the new policy. The update never cancels,
restarts, or reinterprets current work. A small
`session.mcp.approval_policy.updated` event tells other clients to reload the
authoritative session metadata.

## Deterministic approval regression fixture

Run the real worker approval fixture without a model subscription:

```bash
bun test --timeout 300000 ./test/integration/worker-activity.integration.ts -t 'a requireApproval session MCP tool'
```

The existing `@opengeni/testing` local MCP server records harmless search calls
in memory, and `ScriptedModel` deterministically requests that tool. The test
uses real Postgres, NATS, production runtime preparation, durable interruption
state, and the human decision acceptance lifecycle. It covers both Approve and
Reject, a root/parent/child lineage, parent request/resolution notices, a stale
call id, decision replay before and after settlement, a separate human Pause,
and resuming with a fresh runtime. Approval executes one call; rejection executes
none. Accepting approval while paused must not admit an execution attempt.

The driver submits the human actor's decision directly to the storage acceptance
lifecycle, outside the scripted agent. This is a worker integration regression,
not proof of browser/API authorization, Temporal delivery, or live staging UX.
Those boundaries have separate coverage in `packages/db/test/child-lifecycle-notices.test.ts`,
`test/integration/temporal-workflow.integration.ts`, and the API/UI approval
suites. A live browser run must still use a human-authorized decision and verify
the actual approval card; asking an agent to write "approval needed" is not a
tool-approval test. The fixture is loopback-only and is not a deployed staging
endpoint.

## Storage and rotation

Credential headers are encrypted in `session_mcp_servers.headers_encrypted` with
the same AES-GCM helper used by workspace variable sets. The deployment must set
`OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before accepting session MCP credentials;
otherwise create/rotation requests fail with 503.

`connection_ref` is non-secret JSON and does not require the encryption key by
itself. This lets an embedding host attach its existing GitHub, GitLab, Azure
DevOps, or other provider connection without copying a token or creating an
OpenGeni connection row. Opaque host ids are accepted; standalone connection
lookups still use their ordinary UUID ids. A session server may use static
headers, a connection ref, or neither.

Credentials can still rotate as part of an accepted `user.message` payload;
that existing Send/Steer behavior is unchanged:

```json
{
  "type": "user.message",
  "payload": {
    "text": "continue",
    "mcpCredentialUpdates": [
      { "id": "crm", "headers": { "X-Synthetic-Key": "synthetic-test-value" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rotation can only update headers for servers already attached to that session.
It cannot change URL, name, allowed tools, timeout, or cache behavior. Each
successful rotation replaces the encrypted header map and increments
`credentialVersion`.

Message-bound header rotation cannot change a connection reference. Use the
standalone native-account replacement below to repair an existing attachment;
ordinary `connectionAccounts` selection never silently rewrites it.

### Standalone inline credential rotation

An authenticated host can replace credentials without sending a message:

```http
POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/mcp-credentials/rotate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "operationKey": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "updates": [{
    "id": "crm",
    "expectedCredentialVersion": 1,
    "expectedServerUrl": "https://tools.example.test/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer synthetic-example" }
  }]
}
```

This strict request accepts 1–64 unique existing server IDs. Header names are
trimmed, checked for case-insensitive duplicates, and lowercased for request
identity; header values are not trimmed. Updates and header names are sorted
before computing their keyed fingerprint. Each header map replaces the entire
previous map. The URL must match the stored destination exactly. An unknown
server, changed destination, stale version, duplicate ID, or a server with a
`connectionRef` rejects the whole operation. This does not create, rebind, or
change approval policy, allowed tools, connection authority, or recovery policy.

Both `sessions:control` and `mcp_servers:attach` are required. Existing session
visibility/ownership checks and the optional host callback apply, using the
distinct `session.mcp.credentials.rotate` authorization operation. A host may
deny rotation while allowing `session.control`. Agent-attempt credentials are
not accepted; there is no MCP or Codemode rotation tool. Current authorization
is revalidated in the mutation transaction, including before receipt replay.

Fresh operations require no accepted/pending credential-consuming work:
nonterminal turns, live attempts, interrupted attempts without physical
quiescence, pending machine input, attempt-owned
in-flight workspace admissions, and active/starting realtime prevent rotation.
Checks and persistence use the canonical membership/tenancy/control/session
lock order shared with admission and claim. A historical failed turn, dormant
goal/schedule, retained historical tool/run receipt, or open viewer alone does not prevent rotation. Work admitted
after commit uses the new credentials normally. Rotation never edits an
accepted attempt or refreshes an already-prepared client.

The stable receipt is:

```json
{
  "operationKey": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "sessionId": "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222",
  "servers": [{ "id": "crm", "credentialVersion": 2 }],
  "appliedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The existing durable command-receipt ledger scopes the key by authenticated
actor, account/workspace, session, and operation. An exact replay returns the
original receipt without another write, even after later activity or rotation.
Reusing that scoped key with different normalized input is a 409. Version,
destination, and quiescence conflicts are also 409; malformed/brokered requests
are 422. Existing authentication/session denial statuses remain applicable.

### Standalone native-account replacement

The same endpoint and SDK method also accept `nativeConnectionId` **instead of**
`headers` for an existing attachment:

```json
{
  "operationKey": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "updates": [{
    "id": "crm",
    "expectedCredentialVersion": 1,
    "expectedServerUrl": "https://tools.example.test/mcp",
    "nativeConnectionId": "33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333",
    "replacementServerUrl": "https://tools.example.test/mcp/organizations/example"
  }]
}
```

This explicitly replaces the saved reference, including a retired host-owned
reference, without creating a successor session or changing workspace defaults.
The account must be active and visible through the authenticated caller's native
account inventory: a workspace account in this workspace or that caller's own
personal account. A service cannot name another user's personal account.
Caller-supplied owners, references and authority sources are not accepted.

`replacementServerUrl` is optional and exclusive to native replacement. Omit it
to retain the endpoint. Supply it explicitly when the native account is bound to
a different endpoint; it must match that account's stored `metadata.mcpUrl`, not
merely its provider domain. `expectedServerUrl` always names the **old** saved URL
and remains a strict compare-and-set precondition. Account selection alone never
redirects an attachment.

The existing provider domain, scopes, OAuth resource and selected-resource
restrictions remain intact. If the old reference has no OAuth resource, the native
account's stored resource is pinned. A conflicting old resource restriction is
rejected, not dropped. The account metadata must match the explicitly requested
destination and resource binding; the ordinary credential broker still checks the
actual credential binding and current execution authority at physical use.
The replacement removes the retired host binding and clears inline headers,
then increments `credentialVersion`. Except for the explicitly requested URL replacement, selected tools, approval policy,
history, files and accepted-attempt snapshots do not change.

All standalone authorization, quiescence, version/destination fencing and keyed
replay rules above apply. An inaccessible or incompatible native account returns
422 `credential_rotation_connection_unavailable`, without any partial update.
An exact successful receipt replays after later account revocation; it records
the prior configuration change and grants no fresh account access. Subsequent
admission and execution still reject unavailable accounts. Do not resume an old
failed attempt expecting its frozen identity to change: accept new work through
the ordinary authenticated message API after reconciling the repair receipt.

Headers use the existing AES-GCM encryption. Receipt fingerprints use
domain-separated HMACs, never plaintext or unkeyed hashes of credentials. No
secret values, header names, ciphertexts, or fingerprints are returned in the
receipt or added to session events/history. Replacing the deployment encryption
key makes old receipt verification unavailable: replay returns explicit 503
`credential_rotation_receipt_key_unavailable`, not a misleading payload conflict
or a second write. There is no key ring or automatic receipt-key migration.
Operators must account for existing encrypted credentials and receipt replay
availability before replacing the encryption key.

The SDK method is `OpenGeniClient.rotateSessionMcpCredentials`. Neither API nor
SDK retries this mutation automatically. After an ambiguous response, reconcile
with the same operation key and exact normalized request; do not mint a fresh
key blindly. No user message, turn, workflow wake, retry, or implicit Resume is
created. In particular, this operation grants no permission to replay an
outcome-unknown external tool call or resume a failed turn.

## Connector permission settings

The workspace connector detail sheet loads the server's current MCP tool catalog
through `GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/capabilities/:capabilityId/tool-permissions`.
`PATCH` on the same route accepts the displayed connection identity, `allow`,
`ask`, or `block`, and an explicit target: `target: "default"` changes the server
default; `target: "tools"` requires a bounded `toolNames` list of unprefixed tool
names. Tool targets reject the reserved name `*`. A connector advertising that
literal tool name omits it from editable groups with an explicit discovery notice;
the server default still governs it. `OpenGeniClient.getConnectorToolPermissions` and
`updateConnectorToolPermissions` expose the same contract.

Policies require `capabilities:manage`; agent attempts and services cannot change
them. Personal connections additionally require the authenticated owning human.
Credential lookup and tool discovery use the existing connection broker and
pinned network transport. Discovery never invokes a tool. A failed discovery
leaves saved policies intact and offers reconnect/retry. A changed connection
identity rejects an outdated settings write. Host-owned MCP credentials retain
host-managed settings.

The UI groups tools by optional MCP annotations. Destructive annotations take
precedence over a read-only annotation; unannotated tools appear separately.
These are presentation hints, never permission authority. A group change writes
explicit overrides for its currently listed tools. The server wildcard default
covers future tools; a more-specific policy still wins. The UI's Allow does not
remove session or deployment approval requirements, or action-specific policy.
Changes are captured by subsequent attempts, never injected into an active one.

Credential-free and encrypted-header MCP servers use the existing stable
`session-mcp:<server id>:<sha256 of endpoint URL>` identity. This identity changes
when the destination changes. Native connections use the broker-resolved exact
connection id, including subject-owned generic refs. Both normal model calls
and Codemode enforce the same frozen connector policies before provider calls.
Codemode Ask returns its typed approval-required error and must be invoked via
the normal model tool path to request human approval.

## Connector action policy enforcement

Connection-backed MCP tools can additionally be governed by workspace
`connector_action_policies`. Each versioned row scopes one connection, server,
tool, and action (with `*` wildcards for server/tool/action) to `allow`, `ask`,
or `block`. Attempt claim copies a bounded, ordered policy snapshot into
`session_turn_attempts.connector_action_policies`; later policy edits affect a
new attempt only, except that an already-created Ask request keeps its original
decision across the approval-resume attempt.

Resolution is most-specific-first. Two matching policies with equal specificity
fail closed as Block. No matching row preserves the historical unmanaged
behavior. The connector decision composes monotonically with `requireApproval`:
Block stops before MCP invocation, Ask requires the ordinary durable approval,
and Allow never removes a session-level approval requirement.

Managed calls use `connector_action_requests` as an idempotency and evidence
ledger. It freezes the initiating actor, original attempt, connection/server/
tool identity, the matched attempt-frozen policy action selector (`*` for a
wildcard or ambiguous match), policy id/version/source, and a canonical SHA-256
action fingerprint. A caller-controlled `arguments.action` is used only
transiently for policy matching and is never copied into request or audit rows.
Approval records the authenticated approver separately. The execution attempt
is recorded when an approved request resumes. A repeated call after execution
began is marked outcome-uncertain and denied rather than sent to the provider
again. Audit rows contain only these bounded identifiers, decisions, timestamps,
fingerprints, and coarse outcomes—never raw arguments, headers, credentials,
request bodies, tool results, or response payloads.

Child inheritance is a create-time snapshot, not a live credential link. A
static encrypted header map is copied as ciphertext and starts at credential
version 1 on the child; future parent and child rotations are independent. A
copied `connectionRef` continues to resolve fresh request-time credentials and
is therefore the preferred embedding-host path for rotating provider access.

Rotation is effective on the next turn: the API validates updates up front, then
applies credential updates only after the session has accepted the `user.message`
inside the locked append transaction, before the event is appended and the turn
is queued. The worker loads the latest decrypted headers during turn preparation
immediately before `runtime.prepareTools`.

## Runtime path

`packages/core/src/domain/sessions.ts` validates create-time servers, rejects id
collisions, encrypts headers, persists the rows in the same transaction as the
session, and records only metadata in `session.created` events.

`acceptSessionUserMessage` validates `mcpCredentialUpdates` before posting the
new turn. The encrypted row update runs after the cancelled-session guard in the
same locked acceptance path, and only metadata is persisted in the `user.message`
event.

`apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/tool-environment.ts` overlays session MCP servers after
capability and Codex overlays, and before `runtime.prepareTools`. The worker-only
DB accessor decrypts headers for that run path, combines them with the exact
attempt's approval-policy snapshot, and carries the connection ref into the
runtime settings. Normal model MCP and Codemode/Code Mode use that same
attempt-fenced configuration and request-time resolver, including forced refresh
after a 401. Normal session reads return only safe metadata and the non-secret
connection pointer.

Each durable session tool ref may set `eager: true`. Eagerness is not inferred
from mandatory/strict selection: on a fresh progressive-disclosure turn, only
those exact servers join the first-provider-request barrier. Every other MCP,
including strict first-party OpenGeni, begins connection/listing concurrently.
Ordinary text may settle without waiting; `tool_search`, deferred invocation,
Codemode activation, and catalog-dependent work join the same attempt promise.
Generic deferred invocation then renames a valid `tool_invoke` to the exact
authorized tool and binds it through `resolveMissingFunctionTool` in the same
model response; leftover historical registration items stay absent from provider
history and user-visible events. This is never a second authority registry or a
weaker authorization path. Duplicate refs
merge conservatively: strict wins for failure semantics and eager wins for the
startup choice. Approval/human-input resumes and editable-artifact turns remain
fully prepared because continuation requires their exact prior execution/catalog
identity.

The worker supplies attempt-bound connector policy hooks to the runtime before
the attempt catalog is frozen. The canonical gateway lifecycle evaluates exact
arguments during prepare, before Codemode's execution-start marker; performs
durable begin at the actual executor boundary; and settles completed versus
not-executed or uncertain afterward. Model MCP and Codemode therefore share the
same connection-backed policy path. The model SDK wrapper remains only the
ordinary human-approval projection for Ask and propagates the exact approved
call id on resume. Dedicated provider adapters may classify their result or
thrown failure, but do not run a second connector-policy lifecycle. None of this
changes tool selection, connector visibility, request-time credential/live
authority checks, or Slack interaction progress delivery.

## Dedicated-read invariant

Configured credential values and canonical arbitrary content follow different
paths:

1. Core treats typed create/rotation fields as configured-secret writes and
   atomically stores authenticated ciphertext plus metadata. It does not
   regex-scan or rewrite arbitrary messages, tool results, errors, or source
   content that happen to resemble headers or tokens.
2. Ordinary session/event/list projections contain credential references,
   header names, and versions, not a hidden masked substitute. The approved
   release-held follow-up adds a dedicated tenant-scoped secret read that returns
   exact plaintext only after the owning resource authorization plus
   `secrets:read` succeeds and its metadata-only audit record commits; it is not
   implemented in this emergency head.

Do not expose header values through unrelated API, event, log, span, or audit
paths. When the dedicated authorized read ships, do not weaken it by masking,
hashing, or rewriting the returned plaintext.
