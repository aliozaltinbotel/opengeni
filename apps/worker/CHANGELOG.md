## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8669490: Add per-person product lifecycle facts to the durable host export as a third kind, `lifecycle_fact`. Migration `0532_product_lifecycle_fact_export.sql` (rolling) captures one content-free fact per sign-up, email verification, sign-in, organization setup, model connection, credit top-up, connection, scheduled task, installed catalog Skill, Slack user link, enrolled machine and organization join, in the same transaction as the product change. Nothing is captured until a host registers a `lifecycle_fact` consumer, and a capture failure never fails the product change.

  Every fact is a fixed type with an optional value from a fixed per-type list (`PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE_FACT_ATTRIBUTES`), a subject kind, the opaque `user:`/`api_key:` subject id when there is one, and the organization and workspace UUIDs when the product change has them. Sign-up, verification and sign-in facts carry no organization. `claimHostExportBatch` accepts `kind: "lifecycle_fact"` and returns a `HostLifecycleFactExportBatch`; `createHostExportPump` accepts an optional `lifecycleSink`.

- f986809: Scheduled tasks can post to one Slack channel as the OpenGeni workspace bot. A person chooses the channel in the schedule editor ("Post to Slack" under Advanced), stored as `agentConfig.slackBotChannelId` next to `slackBotConnectionId`. Choosing or changing it needs a signed-in person with `connections:write`, and the bot must be a member of an active channel that is not shared with another organization. Agents, services and API keys cannot set or change it. `listScheduledTaskSlackChannels` in the SDK lists the eligible channels.

  Runs of such a task get two tools, `slack_bot_prepare_message` and `slack_bot_send_prepared_message`, which take no channel. Prepare saves the exact text; send posts it to the task's channel with the saved server-owned id as the Slack post operation id, so a retried send never posts twice. Both re-read the task at every call, so clearing or changing the channel takes effect immediately and never redirects an already prepared message. Rolling migration 0530 adds the private prepared-message table and its two capabilities.

### Patch Changes

- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- a5e93ba: Background commands that finish quickly but print a lot of output are now recognized as finished on the next background check instead of staying "running" for hours. Their sandbox can then save its workspace and go idle normally, instead of being held until the provider's 24-hour limit ends it. A command's saved output keeps its first 16 MiB and its final part, with a note where output was skipped.
- 056997b: Make `skill_checkout` fast. The worker now writes a Skill's files through one Channel-A `fsWriteFiles` batch, normally a single sandbox command with one workspace mutation admission and one `fs.changed` event, instead of about five sandbox commands per file. On a real Docker sandbox an 11-file, 31 KB Skill went from 61 sandbox commands, 35 mutation admissions, and 13 events (about 4 s) to 1 command, 1 admission, and 1 event (about 0.1 to 0.2 s). Checkout never overwrites: files already holding the same bytes are kept and reported `unchanged`, and any different existing entry fails before anything is written, so repeating a checkout into the same directory is safe. New optional `paths` copies exactly those files, for example one script to run. Only a complete checkout that created its directory returns the `skill_publish` base; other results say `publishable: false`. The default `skill_read` also returns a bounded `scripts` index (path and first usage line) so commands are visible without a checkout. The worker records `opengeni_skill_checkouts_total`, `opengeni_skill_checkout_duration_seconds{phase}`, and `opengeni_skill_checkout_files_total`. `@opengeni/runtime` exports `SandboxChannelAService.fsWriteFiles`, `FsWriteFilesRequest`, `FsWriteFilesResponse`, and `skillScriptIndex`.
- 37c478b: Allow goal continuations to suspend for work already in flight without a mandatory preliminary status check. Preserve tool-availability gating, event-driven resumption, and safety deadlines.
- 6f28afd: A definitively lost managed Modal sandbox no longer dead-ends its sessions. Shared sandbox groups (a parent with its children) now get the automatic checkpoint fallback, and every member receives the durable filesystem-discontinuity warning. When no checkpoint can be restored automatically (no archive, an unverified or legacy archive, an invalid artifact, or a definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure of the selected checkpoint), the whole quiescent group continues on a new empty workspace after a separate audited decision that warns every member the previous files are not available. Loss must be proven by a loss transition (a failed replacement box never counts), the empty workspace waits until the lost box is past its hard provider lifetime, other restore failures (including a missing archive object, now `archive_object_missing`, or unconfigured archive storage, now `archive_storage_unavailable`) retry the checkpoint with backoff and then wait for an operator, and a complete archive is never bypassed. Ambiguous provider states and live writers in any member still block, unknown command outcomes are never replayed, and the lost archive evidence is kept. Sessions stuck before this release recover on their next turn or Retry. The recovery projection adds `automaticLane` (`checkpoint` or `fresh_workspace`) and, for a timed wait, `availableAt` (when a Retry or a new message can decide again), and the failed-session banner says what Retry will do and when. Rolling migration 0548 requires warning protocol v3 to claim a session with an empty-workspace receipt.
- 32598eb: Expose content-free MCP phase timings and host-owned outbound trace correlation across gateway, credential, transport and persistence boundaries. Preserve W3C sampling flags, credential header semantics, exact execution authority and existing retry behavior.
- a6854a7: Allow completed turn owners to reach bounded Modal deadline capture without an interruption-only quiescence receipt. When the provider is definitively gone, select only a verified singleton CURRENT checkpoint for automatic continuity, persist a cache-stable filesystem warning before the agent runs, and fence old workers from affected sessions. Keep unknown command outcomes and unavailable or invalid archives fail-closed.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 5ab0b13: Remove the unconditional five-second grace period from normal session idle completion and child-result handoff. Keep the final durable work recheck, transactional idle settlement and parent-result deduplication, and close-race signal guard. Fence runnable machine input accepted before idle settlement as well as queued turns, preventing a stale parent result when input wins that race. Late follow-ups may start another workflow run of the same session through the durable wake path. A Temporal patch preserves legacy timer histories; held input waits, goal backoff, cancellation, quiescence, and capacity timers are unchanged.
- 126a395: Make agent effort proportional to the request. The operational contract now asks for a direct answer with minimal tool use on simple asks, reuse of the earlier approach on repeat asks, one-sentence progress updates without a forced opening update, answer-first final responses, answers from web or published sources that are short but not partial (the best-supported finding, figures in the user's terms, and a source link beside each study or figure), and reading each Skill once without announcing it. A question asked mid-run gets an answer instead of restarting work; while work is still in flight the agent answers in one or two sentences in the user's terms, naming a blocker only when the user must act on it, and registers the wait again with the earlier reason and remaining time, even with an active goal, so its result still resumes the agent without pushing back a timed recheck, and a question alone no longer resumes a paused goal. Answers stay in chat by default; a document Artifact is created only when the user asks for one or the deliverable is large or meant to be kept or shared, and a session no longer creates a goal only to declare a document. The default persona is a general assistant; it works on a branch with a pull request only when the repository has a remote and git provider credentials, and otherwise leaves changes in the working tree without branch or pull request talk unless the user asks, saying only that the changes are not pushed when the repository has a remote, and the Sites and visualize Skill descriptors apply when the user asks or clearly benefits.
- aa29eae: Rate-limited turns now back off with an escalating floor (10 s, 20 s, 40 s, 60 s, 120 s), and a longer provider `Retry-After` still wins. Previously a one-second `Retry-After` on a per-minute token limit used up all five automatic recoveries within seconds and failed the turn.
- 7a08660: Make a finished child's result carry its answer. An idle `child_terminal_result` now includes optional `payload.finalAnswer`: the child's newest result-bearing answer, frozen by the idle settlement, bounded to 8 KiB UTF-8 with a head/tail truncation marker and a `session_events` pointer to the full text (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswer`, `CHILD_TERMINAL_RESULT_FINAL_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES`). No answer is copied when the child's newest turn failed, was cancelled or superseded, or stopped at a segment limit. A turn claimed only to continue the child's goal (for example one that confirms and completes the goal after the answer) no longer replaces the answer: the answer is reported with that turn's output after it as `finalAnswer.goalContinuations`, whole when the parts fit the bound (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswerWithGoalContinuations`). Parts that do not fit are reported as the newest part, marked truncated, with `omittedSequences` and a `nextAction` that reads every part, so a child working across goal continuations still reports its final report. The walk stops at a non-answer outcome and at the child's newest goal activation, and a window holding only continuations reports the newest answer alone. The worker's enrichment upsert now keeps the committed answer and evidence instead of replacing them, and an untruncated answer serves as the parent claim's consumption evidence. When a parent's exact live attempt reads a direct child's complete answer through `session_wait` or `session_events` in its own model call (the worker now marks first-party calls with `_meta.opengeniCaller`, `FIRST_PARTY_MCP_CALLER_META_KEY`; Codemode calls do not count), the answer is recorded on the reading turn (`metadata.consumedChildAnswers`, `recordConsumedChildAnswers`) and `session_wait` stops counting that child's result as own pending input (`listOutstandingSessionSystemUpdatesForAttempt`). The attempt's successful completion settlement supersedes each still-pending idle result whose every part it received (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and a result the child commits after that completion is inserted already consumed, without a wake. A read by an attempt that fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing. The operational contract and the `session_create`, `session_wait`, `session_get`, `session_send_message`, and `wait_for_input` descriptions now price a child, prefer a direct answer or reusing an existing child, and steer multi-minute waits to `wait_for_input` instead of alternating `session_wait` and `session_get`. No tool is capped or removed.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled occurrence the scheduler refuses before running it is now a visible
  run instead of a thrown, retried activity or a silently dropped occurrence.
  `ScheduledTaskRun.admissionRefusal` (`{ version, reason, retryable }`, with
  `error` equal to `reason`) covers unprovable authority, an unavailable
  Connected Machine target, a missing Variable Set, a Sandbox Environment without
  an active version (terminal, status `failed`), and an inactive machine
  enrollment, insufficient credits or monthly limits (transient, status
  `skipped`; later occurrences run normally). Redelivery never adds a second run.
- 3f9c757: Scheduled tasks created by an organization or workspace API key (or the
  configured key) are now ownerless service schedules and run. Previously the
  key subject became the schedule's immutable owner, and every occurrence failed
  invisibly in the scheduler. An occurrence refused because its frozen authority
  cannot be proven is now recorded as a failed run with error
  `scheduled_authority_unavailable` instead of being retried to exhaustion with
  no run.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled run whose turn waits for a tool approval or a structured question
  is now visible: `ScheduledTaskRun.awaitingHuman` (`{ since, expiresAt }`) on run
  listings and `awaitingHuman` on the scheduled-task attention list, instead of the
  run looking merely "dispatched". The new optional
  `agentConfig.approvalTimeoutSeconds` (60 s to 30 days; default none) lets the
  scheduler reject the pending approval (or skip the question) as a labelled
  system decision once nobody answered in time, driven by a durable workflow
  timer.
- 30414a0: Add the first-party `session_set_model` MCP tool for changing an existing session's future model and reasoning defaults without waking it or rewriting accepted work. Preserve ordinary target authorization and exact-attempt fencing, provide stable idempotent receipts across reconnects, and report canonical model, reasoning and latency settings in full session readback. Share effective defaults across prompt admission, goal continuation, compaction and scheduled snapshots so older queued or resumed turns cannot undo an explicit choice. Deploy API and workers from a matched source cohort before using the new operation.
- 740bebd: A repeated default `skill_read` of the same Skill no longer returns the full `SKILL.md` again while that exact text is still in the session's active model history. The model receives a short `alreadyInContext` receipt with the current revision identity instead. Reads that compaction removed from history count as absent, so the next read returns full text. A stored read counts only if the current model receives it untruncated under its own tool-output bound, and a failed history lookup returns full text. Explicit `paths` (including `["SKILL.md"]`), `listFiles`, and Codemode callers always receive content. The tool schema, instructions, and Skill index are unchanged, so the cached prompt prefix is unaffected. `@opengeni/db` exports `getActiveSessionFunctionToolResults` for the active, call-paired results of one function tool.
- 514f8ea: Count Skill reads and record a content-free Skill-use fact on each model `skill_read` event. The worker increments `opengeni_skill_reads_total{source, skill, kind, caller}`, where `skill` is a built-in id or `custom`, so tenant Skill ids, names, and requested identifiers never become labels. A successful model read also carries `_meta["opengeni/skillUse"]` (resolved id and source, ledger revision or whole-artifact digest, result kind, returned bytes, whether the Skill was in this turn's model-visible index, and whether `skill_search` returned it earlier in the attempt). MCP `_meta` never reaches the model, so the model-visible result and model history stay byte-identical; only the `agent.toolCall.output` event projection keeps the fact. Codemode results never carry it, and it is dropped rather than let a result cross the 1 MiB model-visible cap. `@opengeni/contracts` exports `SkillUse`, `SkillUseSource`, `SkillReadKind`, `SKILL_USE_META_KEY`, and `skillUseFromToolOutput` (the writer schema is closed; the reader drops fields a newer writer adds instead of the whole fact); `@opengeni/runtime` exports `skillCatalogEntryIds` and `modelToolResultFits`.
- b28d5fa: Reading a session's stored bundled Skill selection now drops ids this build does not know instead of failing the whole session read. Dropping only narrows the stored selection; API input still rejects unknown ids, and keyed create replay still compares the exact stored selection. The bundled `document-parsing` guide now ships the upstream AnyDoc MIT license and a `SOURCES.md` attribution, the runtime package notices cover both AnyDoc-derived guidance copies, and the `skill_install` description no longer claims that `skill_search` returns library ids.
- bcd9988: Give the model the current time without a tool call, and ask supported models for shorter answers. Each claimed user message now carries a separate `[Message sent <weekday> <date> <HH:MM> UTC]` part taken from the turn's durable acceptance time, and each delivered machine-input batch states its `deliveredAt` and every member's `createdAt` (scheduled occurrences add `Delivered:` and `Created:` lines). The times are persisted with the history row, never computed at inference time, and never enter `Agent.instructions`. Agent turns on the Codex subscription, direct OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses routes send `text.verbosity: "low"` for GPT-5-family and later models; the new optional `textVerbosity` agent option is omitted everywhere else, so Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, chat and other compatible routes are unchanged. `reasoning.summary` is unchanged. Realtime voice-call history now keeps a user message's separate parts on separate lines.
- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

- efa453c: `skill_read` and `skill_checkout` now answer an identifier that resolves to no Skill with the available Skills (id and name only, bounded to 25 entries and 4 KiB, entries resembling the requested identifier first, the rest via `skill_search`) instead of only "Skill is not available in this session", so the model can retry with a valid id.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2563950: Add a database runtime kill switch for the one-time verified signup trial credit (rolling migration 0521). A grant now needs both `OPENGENI_VERIFIED_SIGNUP_TRIAL_CREDITS_ENABLED` and the newest row of the append-only `opengeni_private.verified_signup_trial_switch_revisions` table, which starts enabled. Operators flip it with the owner-only audited `set_verified_signup_trial_credits_enabled(enabled, operator, reason)` function. The change applies to the next setup transaction on every API replica, with no deploy or restart. Runtime roles can only read the switch. `readVerifiedSignupTrialSwitch` exposes the switch state, and the control worker publishes it as `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_runtime_enabled`, next to `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_deployment_enabled` for the master opt-in.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.

### Patch Changes

- f3d178b: A model tool call to `knowledge_search` (first-party and Docs MCP) or `knowledge_prepare_save` now receives a compact copy of the result: the same JSON without timestamps, rank score, revision lineage, session and review-batch IDs, default-valued flags, a collection descriptor's `revisionId`, or a `revision.preview` that is empty or already begins a content excerpt starting at offset 0. Every entry and collection ID, `version`, `revision.id`, scope, publication status, title, kind, group and parent ID, description, excerpt, index status and cursor is kept, and a preview with unique text is kept in full. Codemode scripts and every other programmatic caller still receive the exact result. The projection runs at the existing per-caller seam (`projectAttemptToolResultForCaller`, which gains an optional tool identity), after the MCP transport has bounded the exact result; a result still over 1 MiB for the model spills its exact bytes. It affects only new tool outputs and passes any result that does not strictly match the contract through unchanged. On fixtures sized to staging medians a search result shrinks by 44% and a save preparation by 35%.
- 9cdeef1: Git credential provisioning scripts (the repository clone setup and both token refresh commands) now refuse to run unless the sandbox lifecycle hook marks the command as targeting a sandbox. Executed directly on a developer or host machine they exit with status 78 before touching `$HOME/.opengeni` or the global Git configuration, instead of replacing that user's credential helpers. The runtime's clone and renewal hooks add the marker, so sandbox behavior is unchanged.
- cbb7aa4: Let a normally completed, closed turn owner reach bounded Modal deadline and repeated-provider-error capture without an interruption-only quiescence receipt. Failed or interrupted owners still require physical quiescence proof; checkpoint publication and other-writer fences are unchanged.
- 48a8774: Generate automatic session titles on chat-completions providers, such as OpenRouter connections, through one direct request outside the agent runner instead of a runner-only traced call that always failed. Routes without a resolved provider client now take the same direct path. The title request uses the model's lowest runnable reasoning effort and a larger output budget, a response stopped by the output limit keeps only whole words, and inline `<think>` reasoning before the answer is dropped. Automatic titles no longer keep a dangling closing quote or markdown mark from a wrapped title such as `"Pod Crash Debugging"` or `**Pod Crash Debugging**`. The managed OpenRouter free route (`isManagedOpenRouterFreeRoute`: the deployment-funded OpenRouter provider serving a `:free` variant) sends no title request, because it would spend the deployment key's shared per-minute and per-day request limits that users' turns need; those sessions keep the prompt preview until a turn on another route titles them.
- fa12bd4: Keep detached NATS subscription loops from rejecting the process: a poison message or throwing consumer is dropped and logged, and a subscription error such as a permissions violation ends only that subscription instead of reaching the API's fatal unhandled-rejection boundary. A session or workspace-control SSE stream whose live subscription ends fails retryably so the client replays from Postgres, and the auth-callout, Codemode request, and agent-event responders resubscribe with bounded backoff; every unexpected end is counted in `opengeni_nats_subscription_terminations_total` and alerts. Long-lived NATS connections keep reconnecting through repeated auth errors. A freshly created sandbox that misses its command-readiness budget is terminated and replaced at most once per turn attempt after a jittered pause, with outcomes in `opengeni_sandbox_readiness_replacements_total`, and Codex/xAI capacity-wait wakes are spread by a bounded replay-safe jitter so a capacity reset no longer resumes every waiting turn at once.
- 36e1764: An exhausted model-provider quota no longer retries. A daily or monthly allowance (for example OpenRouter's `free-models-per-day` cap or a requests/tokens-per-day limit), a used-up quota (`insufficient_quota`), an account out of credits (HTTP 402), or a 429 whose provider retry hint exceeds 15 minutes now fails the turn at once with the new `provider_quota_exhausted` code, `retryable: false`, a `quotaScope`, plain-language copy, and the provider's text as `detail`, instead of five paced same-turn recoveries. Ordinary per-minute rate limits, and quota wording whose provider retry hint is a minute or less, remain `provider_rate_limited` and retryable. `@opengeni/runtime` exports the classifier (`classifyProviderQuotaError`), and model clients that let the OpenAI SDK retry classify the exact SDK error for a 429 and mark an exhausted one `x-should-retry: false`, so the SDK does not replay it either and both decisions always agree. Google's generic `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status and snake_case per-minute metric ids (Vertex `requests_per_minute_per_project`) stay retryable. A quota-refused compaction request records the same `quotaScope` marker, and failed session detail projects it. Codex and SuperGrok subscription transports keep their credential-rotation and capacity-wait semantics.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

### Minor Changes

- 6d0a4de: Include opengeni-client in the default Skill catalog in local, self-hosted and
  managed deployments. The repository guide is the sole authored source; generated
  runtime assets include every reference and require no Pack, installation, network
  fetch or sandbox to read. Explicit bundledSkillIds selections still narrow it.

  Improve adaptive resource discovery, UI selection, runtime behavior, tool data
  semantics, and outcome-based verification without prescribing a fixed product
  architecture or answer format.

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.

### Patch Changes

- a6d3e4a: Route persistent behavior to scoped workspace instructions or applicable Skills
  instead of retrieval-only Knowledge. Make the routing and safe instruction-edit
  guidance unconditional, reinforce it in save tools and Skill guidance, and retain
  the existing scope and Agent learning controls.
- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- c6f98cc: Preserve bounded provider error classifications and opaque lease correlation for drain capture failures, without exposing provider messages or allowing logging failures to interrupt recovery cleanup.
- fabf288: Make an active worker execution searchable through its completed claim span without exporting raw identifiers or adding metric cardinality.
- c702159: Stop retrying permanent runtime database posture and configuration failures as
  connection errors. Validate local startup prerequisites, prevent overlapping
  launchers from rotating live database credentials, and check database posture
  before building the development sandbox.
- 9a7931c: Observe the fixed Modal materialization visibility probe through its own
  cancelable provider cursor instead of borrowing the parent mutation's retained
  command handle. Preserve actual failures and unconfirmed deadline evidence
  without retrying materialization or agent work.
- 8d918ed: Prepare operator compaction from canonical history without requiring a user message or internal update batch.
- 9d5bb1c: Persist the periodic workspace capture attempt clock so failed snapshots respect the configured interval instead of blocking commands again on the next heartbeat. Forced recovery captures still bypass periodic cadence without bypassing ownership or active-capture fences.
- 9d9b94b: Keep the published dependency closure aligned with the updated plugin removal
  contracts. The SDK exposes named removal outcomes and optional preview-token
  confirmation alongside the existing installation-version check.
- 0a41330: Reuse the fully prepared model request for remote compaction, including sandbox instructions, filtered tools, and model settings. Prepare operator and pre-turn compaction through the same model boundary without sending ordinary inference. Capture compaction requests in model diagnostics.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- a6251eb: Add isolated async trace context, parent/link export, bounded trace batching and
  retry health, and opt-in protected failure diagnostics independent of the
  application database. Preserve the public telemetry privacy projection.
- a19f12f: Continue completed Connected Machine command output replay across partial batches using one integrity checkpoint, instead of repeatedly restarting before the terminal frame. Preserve capture failures, no-progress deferral, exact operation identity, and verified terminal settlement.
- d3672c0: Measure workspace capture gate waits on every routed sandbox operation, including
  mid-turn and API-direct operations, without changing provider-call accounting or
  admission guarantees. Record physical warm capture and publication duration at
  actual settlement, including captures that outlive the initiating caller.
- d84b1a3: Preserve sandbox visibility-check command evidence in durable turn failures and
  expose bounded, explained failure categories on the Runtime Failures dashboard.
- e261718: Preserve bounded provider error classifications in workspace snapshot diagnostics without logging provider messages, request identifiers or payloads.
- 04593f2: Keep compacted attachment catalogs stable across turns by avoiding duplicate current-file references in older history.
- 23d4542: Allow repeatedly unobservable, explicitly stopping managed commands to enter the existing checkpoint-before-termination recovery after owner quiescence and idle grace. Preserve running commands, all other writer fences, failed-checkpoint recovery, and real late exit proof.
- f90d628: Keep supervised commands out of legacy observation-error containment, including
  stale enrollment, checkpoint publication and published-capture teardown retries.
  Fence older control writers at the database boundary before enabling supervision.
- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.
- d854a61: Keep the worker heartbeat cleanup from releasing a closed turn's holder before its bounded warm capture settles, avoiding premature drain and cold restore.
- b384b43: Record workflow wake transport and durable admission outcomes separately, with bounded blocker metrics and useful public log fields.

### Major Changes

Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- e41027c: Add opt-in MCP operation outcome recovery through a configured read-only provider receipt tool. Persist exact operation identity before dispatch, retain original invocation outcomes separately from late receipts, and revalidate current authority across accepted attempts without replaying mutations. Preserve arbitrary SDK call IDs as correlation rather than replacing UUID operation identity.

  Apply the additive operation-ledger migration and runtime-role provisioning, and upgrade all claim-capable workers to the membership-first lock order before enabling provider mappings. Providers must implement the documented observation contract; unsupported providers and historical operations without captured authority are not automatically recoverable.

### Patch Changes

- 22a9e4d: Bound sandbox acquisition and workspace mutation waits across repeated archive capture attempts. Honor the first observed capture's persisted timeout once, without letting expired or renewed claims replenish the caller's deadline; retain all capture and writer fences.

  Release an exact unpublished drain capture after its provider promise rejects, including after a local timeout, so waiting turns can resume the intact live sandbox. Unresolved captures, published archives, successors, and provider teardown remain fenced.

  Fresh claims allocate a new provider request identity; uninterrupted replacements retain it, preventing stale snapshot replay after an intervening writer re-arms the lease.

- d08dbb6: Support capability-gated transactional large-file edits on Connected Machines,
  with bounded transfers, verified outcomes, and live authorization checks. Keep
  legacy agent writes compatible and report oversized outbound requests accurately
  instead of marking a healthy agent offline. Native agent support is required;
  unsupported filesystem semantics fail closed.

### Patch Changes

- e1a50ba: Spool Linux host-backed workspace archives through capture, object storage, and cold restore instead of materializing whole JSON/base64 payloads. Isolate each upload at a fresh physical locator and verify stored bytes without assuming conditional-PUT support. Preserve legacy locators, archive format, configured restore limits, and lease capture/publication authority; retain candidates after ambiguous publication outcomes.
- a96c1cc: Track turn-progress gauges per physical attempt and always clear them when the activity finalizes, preventing recoverable replacements from leaving false stuck-turn alerts.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Use authenticated canonical users instead of session end-user labels. Session
  creation rejects caller-supplied identity scope; list filters use scopeSubjectId.
  Chat user mode uses asUser and explicit workspace membership, while collaborators
  address the same session ID. Reopen legacy user-namespaced chats by session ID.

  Retire active session Memory in favor of task notes. Historical session Memory
  remains stored and old selectors hydrate as off, never workspace. User Memory
  uses the verified active-turn user. Preserve frozen scheduled agent-reach policy.
  Migration 0457 requires the documented maintenance cutover and matching writers.

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

## 0.27.2

### Patch Changes

- 69924e8: Preserve structured model-history ordering through PostgreSQL replay and pending-tool recovery. Retain authorized uploaded images across turns and compaction input, preserve images in retained messages, and include their projected token cost in compaction retention budgets. Migration requires draining writers.
- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 0.27.1

### Patch Changes

- 392c575: Retain Modal command handles, provider execution identities, output, and exact exit status across provider-client reconstruction. Persist stream pages before acknowledging their cursors, and treat unavailable historical locators as unknown rather than proof of process loss. Execution status is provider-owned and never read from sandbox-writable files.
- f3bd0d0: Preserve unknown Modal command observations instead of falsely settling local SDK handle loss as physical process loss. Retain exact command holders with explicit deferred/quarantine diagnostics while allowing the original owner's terminal proof to settle normally.
- f04243d: Preserve durable wake acknowledgment receipts through API and worker signalers. Report pending admission and unconfirmed legacy signal delivery separately from acknowledged revisions, so transport acceptance cannot be mistaken for agent execution progress. Existing wake retries and admission fences remain authoritative.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- fa12951: Separate command interaction from session history. Add bounded retained-output command reads and use the same operation for command waits. Terminal reads observe completion and suppress only still-pending completion notifications; running reads, claimed notifications, and historical tool results remain unchanged.

  Make session history conversation-first with complete-message pagination and explicit results, tools, and debug views. Preserve cursor detail selection, provide oversized-message continuation, and keep queued prompts distinct from processed conversation. Update concise model guidance for the new surfaces.

  `command_wait` now uses `waitSeconds`, an output cursor, and the same flat result as `command_read`; clients using the previous command wrapper must update. Apply the additive command-observation migration before starting the new readers.

- 0a81cc8: Add durable workspace pause/resume timers with duration controls, countdowns,
  manual cancellation, and idempotent worker execution. Migration 0420 requires a
  maintenance deployment: drain old writers and deploy matching API/workers.

### Patch Changes

- 22a6704: Correct oversized session-message continuation with bounded source slicing, preserve typed runner terminal failures during command observation, and keep retained command output readable when live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure. Refresh fallback rechecks API authorization and explicitly marks unavailable freshness; it does not mask integrity or authorization errors.
- 8db607e: Make GitHub connector writes capability-first when no explicit workspace action policy matches, while preserving explicit Allow, Ask, and Block decisions.
- d8b0012: Keep parked child waits and active goals from reporting successful completion to their parent. Preserve durable wake deadlines and actual terminal result delivery.
- ac7e07c: Retire background-command tracking after a connected agent instance is replaced, explicitly stopped, or revoked. Preserve historical records without waking old sessions, drain cleanup batches promptly, and scope session stopping counts to the requested trees.
- c04711c: Retain PostgreSQL SQLSTATE and existing database identifier diagnostics for otherwise unclassified turn failures, without changing their error text or retry behavior.
- ba9e5a4: Preserve the exact causal human on child lifecycle follow-up turns so personal session resources remain admissible, isolate child/goal causal claims from complete Agent Steer identities and malformed authority-bearing updates, keep atomic pre-claim database failures—including replay-compatible disposition-only results—retryable instead of terminally discarding pending work, and provide a root-only, failure-epoch-fenced repair whose idempotency receipt binds the exact recovery authority for sessions terminalized by older workers.
- c69ad5f: Preserve externally managed history across opaque compaction checkpoints and verify conversation persistence before continuation. Reject shifted history prefixes and conflicting saved items instead of silently losing completed work.
- 6e167eb: Preserve the supplied admission failure message and classified cause on the durable session failure event when no turn could be claimed.
- 3673900: Preserve receipt wakeups received during quiescence reconciliation so an interrupted session admits its queued replacement. Retain historical workflow behavior behind a Temporal patch marker.
- 732bece: Park sandbox rotation recovery until durable lease progress, and wake the exact waiting turn when provider loss, failed warming, reaping, or teardown release ends its rotation wait.
- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

### Minor Changes

- 6b65383: Replace goal-scoped long waits with self-only session-level `wait_for_input`, add provider-neutral `command_wait`, and deliver terminal background-command proof as exactly-once durable agent input with workflow wakes for nonterminal sessions while preserving event-only audit for terminal sessions.

### Patch Changes

- 6f84c02: Make durable Codex credential leasing unconditional, preserve rotation-off as an active-account-only capacity policy, and recover definitive credential failures through same-turn failover or durable capacity waiting.

- 7c5897f: Preempt sandbox writers and persistent interaction holders at the provider-deadline rotation lead boundary so the zero-holder reaper can capture the exact workspace generation before provider destruction.
- 9c45eae: Keep pending sessions distinguishable with a sensitive-safe opening-prompt preview or short session reference, and let bounded parallel semantic title generation finish after quick responses instead of cancelling it at turn settlement.

- 387e9b3: Make context-compaction alerting follow durable model-aware starts, initialize

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 6934f99: Prevent an active-goal status update from immediately spawning a continuation that repeats the same unchanged external wait. Status turns now establish an available goal hold when progress is genuinely blocked, while continuation turns avoid restating an already-reported wait before calling `goal_wait`.
- fcb5662: Read generated-image references through the generic full-file storage API so valid images larger than one MiB cannot fail the owning turn.
- 9e21a09: Generate pending semantic session titles in a bounded parallel model request so the main assistant response no longer waits on a title tool round trip, while retaining the serialized compatibility path for custom runtimes.
- bcacd54: Release durable BrowserSession and ComputerSession holders when a requested finite-lifetime Modal lease reaches its hard provider deadline, preserve honest operation outcomes, and expose interaction-blocked rotation telemetry.
- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.
- 5ef0757: Allow zero-holder sandbox drains to use a separate extended provider snapshot timeout without lengthening ordinary periodic or turn-end snapshot finalization, while keeping current and historical Modal rotation admission inside provider-deadline headroom and making opted-in lifecycle waiters honor an in-flight child's persisted bounded capture deadline across rolling configuration changes.

## 0.23.1

### Patch Changes

- c3b43a5: Expose bounded durable recovery-backlog metrics from every control worker and alert when closed recoverable attempts remain without active ownership or a settled session projection.
- e41285f: Overlap optional MCP preparation with first inference even when artifact tooling is enabled, keep optional eager integrations off the first-token critical path, reuse immutable large-history projections incrementally, and expose fenced event-append phase latency without changing durable ordering.
- 1f289a0: Attach machine input that arrived during a structured human-input wait to the resumed logical turn after its open tool-call result, while leaving post-resume arrivals for the next turn.
- 96624a7: Move agent computer interaction to managed ComputerSession tools. The legacy runtime desktop API remains exported only as a deprecated, fail-closed migration shell; because direct sandbox desktop control and model-bound tools are no longer functional, release `@opengeni/runtime` as the next major. Managed observations now carry bounded native image content for visual model input while preserving viewer control, explicit manual/on-verify recording, and historical contract parsing.

- 17d253b: Complete personal GitHub identity support across managed, self-hosted, and local modes. Add a compact connect-and-repository UI, exact local-human authority persistence, Docker-safe credential brokering, durable child and goal propagation, and reviewed GitHub tools for pull-request reviews and merges without exposing provider tokens to agents.
- 88c1155: Recover the same logical turn when sandbox deadline rotation aborts an SDK stream instead of committing an empty successful turn.

### Patch Changes

- a7912ea: Add a one-click, owner-authorized OpenGeni Lens GitHub App installation flow for the PR Review Pack, backed by durable single-use OAuth authority, shared signed-webhook routing, and exact-repository least-privilege installation tokens. Keep bring-your-own GitHub App, GitLab, and Azure DevOps registration as the provider-neutral advanced path.

- 96422ad: Quarantine repeatedly unresolvable retained-process provider bindings onto a long fail-closed recheck interval without releasing workspace blockers.
- aaeffe9: Skip human-bound preference snapshot probes for service-only turns while preserving causal-human and legacy subject snapshots.

### Patch Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.
- b5071cf: Require every Rig to layer setup and checks on the deployment-managed platform sandbox, reject new explicit Rig image overrides, keep provider-native image ids out of durable lease identity, and verify Browser, Terminal, and Computer services before publishing a Rig provider image.

### Patch Changes

- 65bc1bc: Apply the documented connectivity backoff sequence to retryable MCP request timeouts, including the workflow checkpoint fallback, while preserving the exact durable count and finite same-turn recovery boundary.
- 92324b5: Preserve lazy tool preparation while fencing every actual local tool call on the shared attempt preparation promise. Codemode now distinguishes a catalog that is still preparing from invalid or stale attempt authority, and repeated same-turn provider or MCP recovery stops after five automatic replacements with explicit terminal exhaustion evidence.
- 56c2384: Handle deferred tool-preparation rejection immediately so an early MCP lifecycle failure cannot surface as a process-level unhandled rejection before the lazy runtime reports the exact error at the tool boundary.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: The first-party `opengeni` MCP server gains `session_human_input_respond` (`sessions:control`, `session.human_input.write`): a live attempt answers or skips another session's structured human-input request, recorded as `agent_attempt:<attemptId>`, and signals that session's workflow exactly like the REST route. `session_wait` reports `ownPendingImmediateUpdates` and `ownPendingDeferredUpdateKinds`; only immediate-class own input ends the wait. The API and both workers install `OPENGENI_CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_ENABLED` into `@opengeni/db` at boot. The worker delivers a child's `child_requires_action` outbox row to the parent right after the `requires_action` settlement (generalized `deliverChildLifecycleOutboxToParent`; the reaper covers crashes) and the goal-continuation prompt explains every child notice kind, offering `opengeni__session_human_input_respond` only when it is in the session's effective first-party selection.
- e6ffdc7: The agent-facing `goal_set` MCP tool no longer accepts `maxAutoContinuations` (the ceiling stays on `CreateSessionRequest.goal` and scheduled tasks), and the operator PATCH resume emits `goal.resumed{reason:"api"}`. The worker passes the configured idle-backoff policy to the goal materializer and treats a `deferred` result like `held`: the workflow closes and the delayed wake-outbox row (or any new input) restarts it, with no Temporal timer.

### Patch Changes

- 72f8fc6: Give sandboxes a scoped GitHub App installation token for every bound repository, public or private. Before credential minting and the runtime clone plan, the turn worker resolves bare `github.com` repository resources (API callers, older sessions, agent-spawned children inheriting a parent's resources) against the workspace's auditable installation allowlists through a bounded metadata-read lookup memoized per process, and stamps the ids for that turn when exactly one allowlist matches; a bound-but-unusable repository stays an anonymous clone and posts one visible `credential.auth_needed` warning per session and URI. Connected Machines are unaffected and resolution never fails the turn.
- 3398c2f: Retain the failed MCP request method, JSON-RPC phase, and bounded exact cause chain in durable recovery diagnostics without changing retry behavior or source error identity.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- fbc760e: Add the first-party `goal_wait` MCP tool and a durable goal continuation hold.
  An orchestrator whose active goal depends on child sessions or an external
  event records a bounded hold (reason plus mandatory deadline, at most 7 days)
  with a `goal.held` timeline fact instead of busy-polling. The continuation
  materializer returns `held` while the declaring turn is still the latest
  finished turn and the deadline is ahead: it never consumes the goal wake
  revision and re-arms a delayed workflow wake at the deadline on every idle
  evaluation. Pending machine input wins with `queue`, and any newer finished
  turn, a passed deadline, or a human/API/agent goal mutation clears the hold.
  The goal projection reports a current hold as `blocked` / `held_for_input`
  with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline (rolling migration 0317).
- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- 29a44c2: Spill oversized model-visible tool results to a workspace File instead of failing the tool or stuffing huge JSON into history. Codemode keeps the 16 MiB journal cap.

### Patch Changes

- cc2fa1b: Keep a live sandbox turn holder alive through a provider-deadline rotation: the resume-side holder-liveness loop releases only when the holder itself is gone or its attempt is superseded (`heartbeatLeaseHolderStatus` separates holder liveness from lease extension), the turn-side rotation checkpoint reinstates its exact lost holder at the same epoch/instance before the warm capture, mutation admission under a requested rotation reports `rotation_in_progress` instead of `lease_fenced` and starts that checkpoint, `write_stdin` to a retained PTY renders admission faults as the tool result instead of failing the turn, and `sandbox.box.terminated` carries the drain reason.
- a55f122: Recover a managed-home session's Connected-Machine-to-home route change as a safe same-logical-turn handoff. The worker durably checkpoints completed model/tool truth, closes only unresolved tool calls, and continues in a fresh home-primary attempt instead of failing the session, while preserving the no-phantom-home and no-ambiguous-replay guarantees.
- 72736ef: Take the canonical turn/attempt lock prefix before retaining a screenshot, retry that idempotent prepare on deadlock, and keep leftover persistence failures from failing the tool.
- 5b509be: Advertise cwd-relative sandbox file paths to the model, and return the SDK execCommand banner (exit code + stdout/stderr) from Connected Machines.

- a65f695: Stop inlining documents as Codex `input_file` (ZDR 400). Keep attaching-turn sandbox copies. Connected Machines sign MinIO with the public endpoint, not Docker DNS.

## 0.20.7

### Patch Changes

- 91d5caf: Add a provider-neutral operational instruction contract for consistent agent collaboration, execution safety, file editing, and skill usage across every OpenGeni persona. Keep persistent system instructions prompt-cache stable, project goal continuations once as canonical user messages, let authoritative human input supersede a pending continuation, and remove the unreliable inferred-progress pause.
- 987742d: Skip the redundant in-box rig marker probe when a live Modal session reports
  the exact immutable image that already passed the rig's content, source,
  provider-binding, and independent cold-boot verification. Missing or mismatched
  image identity retains the existing fail-closed marker and setup path.
- 987742d: Reduce turn-start overhead without reducing admitted history, rig variables, or
  user-visible content. Active history loads in one admitted query, automatic
  compaction skips duplicate history work below threshold, unchanged Codex
  credential pointers avoid redundant session-activity writes, rig defaults
  load at bounded concurrency for admitted worker attempts, and the attempt-scoped
  MCP wrapper no longer reuses a broader process-global tool list.

  Improve large-session interaction by measuring rich-message disclosure without
  a second React commit, showing truthful pending queue actions immediately, and
  replacing the false zero-step placeholder with the session's real lifecycle.

- d168b8f: Allow exact scheduled service turns to materialize organization- and workspace-scoped Variable Sets while preserving causal-human and personal-grant checks for user-scoped sets.
- 6860c5f: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private scopes for Rigs and Connected Machines. Personal machine use and Rig materialization now revalidate exact-attempt grants, membership, workspace access, authority epochs, and generations before runtime access.
- c297fc0: Freeze Company Brain mode and bounded legacy instructions when a turn is
  accepted, then bind them to a content-free first-attempt selection receipt whose
  candidate and rendered-budget subsets make replacement recovery shrink-only.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

### Patch Changes

- 90c0c3e: Persist bounded, content-free Company Brain prompt contribution estimates on authoritative model-call facts and expose their source breakdown and coverage in Workspace Insights.
- e98daf6: Measure physical MCP tool calls by bounded structural outcome and lock the existing provider-declared error path with an HTTP-200 SDK/durability regression.
- ec00479: Add provider-free Google Drive release-readiness receipts, configurable persisted sync budgets, bounded request retry and timeout handling, and scoped sync health telemetry, dashboards, and alerts.
- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- 1ab8023: Deduplicate scheduled alert deliveries onto one atomic responder session per scheduled task and canonical alert occurrence while preserving separate roots for distinct tasks and reopened occurrences.
- 79f57b5: Close terminal SuperGrok SSE streams deterministically; abort any accepted stream after a configurable interval without a complete valid event; and expose metadata-only durable lifecycle audits, bounded metrics, dashboard panels, and timeout alerting without replaying partial work.
- c3f0598: Materialize authorized connector attachments as exact, hash-verified sandbox files while keeping provider bytes and private download URLs out of model, Codemode, and durable event output.
- d2f172c: Add fail-closed, metadata-only capability, exact rig-version health, exact alert-selector data-source checks, and source/claim authority fencing for scheduled incident telemetry responders before expensive retrieval.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 944be7f: Reduce and attribute turn startup latency with lazy sandbox defaults for local development, bounded validator reuse, parallel durable input reads, exact stale-Docker recovery, and low-cardinality worker, runtime, credential, and provider preparation diagnostics.
- 499c70c: Retry transient pre-inference attempt claims atomically, durably re-wake a
  logical turn when its activity failed before creating an attempt, and preserve
  the requested backoff deadline once older workflow-wake revisions are delivered.
  Still-open legacy workflow histories and every effectively active durable work
  shape whose prior wake was delivered now retain the same recovery obligation:
  queued/recovering turns, accepted approval responses, released capacity waits,
  manual compaction, and pending internal updates. Held, paused, live-attempt, and
  already-pending wake states remain untouched.
  Terminal failure retries also close the workflow without synthesizing an
  active-goal continuation.

  from execution progress, and add policy-controlled rewrite proposals with API,
  SDK, MCP, and runtime support.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace provider presets and nullable integration identities with immutable Integration Definitions. Curated and workspace-authored integrations now share one definition-based contract, provenance model, OAuth callback, SDK route, runtime projection, and maintenance migration with no legacy API alias or fallback authority.
- 1e78f58: Replace implicit optional Skill bundles and parallel Pack/session materialization paths with one explicit, provenance-bearing runtime Skill activation model. Curated Skills now require workspace installation, Pack ownership, or exact session selection; native artifact and video Skills remain available only with their matching executable tool surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 1c4ac69: Preserve complete MCP tool results through the runtime, durable database settlement, and worker recovery path without changing model-visible output, including nested prefixed servers, compact approval snapshots, and bounded live-memory retention after durable capture.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 87e9ae6: Add durable Google Drive Changes cursors, Shared Drive-aware delta draining,
  bounded full reconciliation, cursor-invalid repair, and a default-off
  Workspace Events wake seam. Normalize My Drive's root alias before ancestry
  checks and preserve cumulative item, provider-request, and elapsed budgets
  across delta, continuation, and full-repair checkpoints. Carry bounded
  per-object revision floors across delta-to-full and checkpointed full scans so
  older or equal Drive revisions cannot regress accepted metadata/current-version
  state, fail closed on conflicting fallback identities, and keep the first
  observation in one scan generation as a durable monotonic floor. Fence item
  version/metadata writes plus checkpoint and terminal cursor settlement to the
  exact lease, initiating subject, scan, checkpoint generation, and accepted
  floor, so a lost full-page checkpoint cannot replay version 8 as version 7.
- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.
- ff7203c: Add a read-only Atlassian Jira and Confluence connector with shared OAuth setup, selected-source live agent search and reads, and optional governed knowledge synchronization.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- 96965c2: Retain explicit image-tool outputs before they enter live agent history, preventing inline image bytes from reaching durable session history during SDK event/state ordering skew.
- eade67f: Allow Modal cold filesystem-snapshot restores up to 60 seconds to become command-ready before failing lease warm-up.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.

## 0.12.21

### Patch Changes

- 42428a2: Add per-session Codex remote compaction v2 (`remote_v2` / `portable`), with UI landmarks, Codex-only model locking, and opaque token accounting aligned to Codex CLI.
- 7b65614: Keep over-limit viewer-only sandboxes drained until a fresh serialized balance
  or monthly-cap evaluation clears a durable workspace admission gate. Viewer
  reattach can no longer re-arm a draining box or spawn a cold successor, while a
  turn-held sandbox remains viewable.

## 0.12.20

### Patch Changes

- 710b081: Keep sessions usable when a previously selected MCP capability is disconnected or removed. Unavailable historical refs remain visible in effective policy but are omitted from executable tools, and the agent receives a bounded turn-level warning not to claim access to the missing source.
- b7df541: Prevent provider-native checkpoint capture from racing sandbox operations while
  the provider has paused the source box. Capture now owns a durable
  lease/epoch/instance/generation claim, blocks new holders and mutations, drains
  provider-local reads before entering the exclusive snapshot call, and retains
  ownership through late provider settlement and exact stale-claim recovery.
  Modal's typed completed-exec stdin race is also normalized into a side-effect-free
  terminal poll, so an exec that exits between local lookup and the provider write
  settles its retained process instead of failing the enclosing turn.

### Patch Changes

- 3450ee5: Estimate typed images as bounded native media only after validating PNG IHDR CRCs, preserve exact model-history prefixes across requests, and fail closed for computer use whenever hosted or structured-image transport is omitted or unproven so screenshots cannot become base64 function text.

## 0.12.15

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

### Patch Changes

- 1973d2a: Treat provider-native web search as an always-on runtime capability whenever
  the selected provider supports it. Session MCP selection no longer disables
  native search.
- 8478e60: Default workspace-tracking sessions to every configured MCP server while
  preserving exact explicit API allow-lists. Keep OpenGeni's internal carrier and
  default-on Files surface out of the web picker's visible choices and counts.
  Settle provider-native web searches from their own terminal status, render each
  web action truthfully, keep completed searches before the answer they informed,
  and hide unresolved private citation handles from the human timeline.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 7736781: Project supported ready file attachments with verified size and canonical SHA-256 metadata into typed image and file content for Responses model turns while preserving the sandbox-path fallback and durable history invariants.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

### Patch Changes

## 0.10.8

### Patch Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

- bdd531c: Make Codex subscription response timeouts recoverable without blindly replaying partially observed model work. The transport now assigns a durable request identity, records attempt-fenced start/headers/first-byte/terminal metadata, enforces explicit headers, stream-idle, and whole-request deadlines, and retries once only before any response is observed. Exhausted or partial-stream timeouts retain a typed failure class and return the durable session to its existing retryable recovery path instead of hard-failing it with the opaque OpenAI SDK `Request timed out.` error. External cancellation remains authoritative, the SDK retry budget remains disabled, and Codex subscription turns keep their existing zero-credit billing path.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

### Minor Changes

- b9cec61: Let embedding hosts return exact HTTPS smart-Git broker transports for repository
  bindings whose provider credentials cannot be contained to the selected
  repositories. Keep broker bearers off manifests, Git configuration, repository
  metadata, and provider CLIs; renew bearers independently without changing the
  admitted route set.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 32011f1: Add an optional durable host event and usage export for embedded deployments: source-transactional bounded snapshots, immutable turn attribution and session-root lineage, named at-least-once checkpoints, multi-replica leases, replay and retention controls, explicit poison-record disposition, an isolated exporter database role, and a worker delivery pump. Standalone deployments keep capture disabled until a host registers a sink.
- 7d9717a: Ship a release-coherent pre-bundled Temporal workflow artifact and expose a
  role-aware embedded worker lifecycle with health, readiness, metrics, internal
  schedule ownership, and graceful drain. Installed hosts no longer relocate raw
  workflow TypeScript out of `node_modules`.

  Existing lower-level `createOpenGeniWorker` callers should remove copied-source
  `workflowsPath` configuration. Installed control workers use the packaged
  artifact automatically; an explicitly version-bound artifact may be supplied as
  `workflowBundle`. Turn workers reject that control-only override.

- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 3983021: Bind every host Git credential request to immutable session, root-session, turn,
  attempt, execution-generation, and initiator authority. The worker fails closed
  when a host broker is configured without that authority and preserves the same
  authority across identity resolution, lazy provisioning, and proactive renewal.
- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- 3ce795b: Route Toolspace token seeding, renewal, agent commands, and Channel-A terminal
  commands through deterministic per-session files when several sessions share a
  sandbox group. Preserve the box manifest's stable legacy pointer for warm-box
  compatibility, remove any legacy bearer during seeding, and prevent the
  group-global ttyd process from inheriting session-bound Toolspace authority.
- ba78c88: Expose the durable host-export pump through a lightweight `@opengeni/worker-bundle/host-export` subpath so embedded API processes can project events and usage without loading Temporal's native worker runtime.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- 94f2580: Keep sandbox Toolspace and Code Mode available during unbounded turns by
  proactively re-signing the session-bound delegated bearer and atomically
  replacing its off-manifest token file on managed and connected-machine backends.
- 5529945: Support Temporal Cloud and secured external Temporal endpoints across every API
  and worker connection. API-key authentication enables TLS automatically, while
  optional server-auth TLS, SNI override, custom root CA, and paired mTLS
  certificate settings share one validated connection policy.
- 4498714: Declare the externalized GitHub and agent-protocol packages required by the published worker bundle.

### Patch Changes

- 77d65f9: Use one canonical lock order for session-event persistence and retry only idempotent database transactions after deadlock or serialization failures, including generic event appends and operation-keyed Agent commands.
- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.
- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

- 3e65c23: Keep deterministic Codex subscription sharding sticky through 99% usage and
  rotate only after actual exhaustion or a definitive provider refusal. Remove the
  configurable near-exhaustion cutoff so warning presentation cannot strand usable
  subscription allowance.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 477b2bb: Add a "sharded" codex rotation strategy: session-sharded account affinity. Each session is assigned a deterministic HOME account (`hash(sessionId) % healthy-accounts`) at its first codex turn, written as a `policy` pin (a new `sessions.codex_pin_source` discriminator distinguishes it from a user's `manual` pin). A session stays on its one home account for prompt-cache warmth while load spreads ~1/N across the pool.

  Both rotation guards (proactive turn-start and reactive 429) now allow a `policy`-pinned session to rebalance when its account caps — never a `manual` pin, which stays sacred. A rebalance durably REWRITES the session pin (re-sharding over the healthy survivors so capped-account cohorts spread instead of re-concentrating on one failover) rather than moving only the workspace active pointer, because credential selection returns a pinned account with no exhaustion check.

  Pin lifecycle: a `manual` pin is honored under every strategy; a `policy` pin is meaningful only while the sharded policy is active. When a workspace runs a non-sharded strategy (or rotation is disabled), a leftover policy pin is ignored and lazily cleared on the session's next turn — so the session converges to the active strategy instead of idling on a capped ex-home. The strategy is selectable alongside `most_remaining`/`round_robin`/`drain_then_next` via the existing rotation-settings API; unpinned behavior under the other strategies is unchanged.

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b125213: Proactively renew GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps credentials during multi-day managed-sandbox turns, atomically replacing stable token files without model action or manifest mutation.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 39dae14: Make prompt-cache efficiency measurable per model call. The worker now reads `cached_tokens` from the same usage frame that feeds input-token accounting and emits two provider-labelled Prometheus series: `opengeni_model_cached_tokens_total{provider}` (cumulative prompt tokens served from the provider's cache) and `opengeni_model_cache_hit_ratio{provider}` (per-call cached/prompt ratio, bucketed around the alerting threshold). A provider that does not report cached tokens records a real 0 ratio rather than nothing — "the cache did nothing" is the signal — and never a phantom counter increment. Labels stay bounded (provider only; never a session id or account).

  Each per-call `model call usage` log line gains two log-only research dimensions: `servingAccountHash` (an opaque, non-reversible tag for the serving codex credential — the credential row id hashed, never a token) and `accountChangedFromPrevCall` (whether the serving account changed versus the session's previous call — the account-rotation-cold-starts-the-cache hypothesis). These are log-only and never leak into the durable `agent.model.usage` event, which already carries `cachedTokens`. The non-codex credit-debit ledger record additionally carries `cachedTokens` (additive).

  A new starter alert `OpenGeniCodexPromptCacheHitRatioLow` fires when the codex-subscription cache-hit ratio p50 falls below 40% over 30m while codex calls are flowing (traffic-gated with the `or vector(0)` empty-vector guard, promtool-validated).

- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 8fef500: Instrument the token-streaming pipeline with SLIs so "streaming is sluggish" resolves to a number and its layer is attributable. New worker Prometheus series: `opengeni_stream_ttft_seconds{provider}` (time from a model (re)start to its first streamed content delta, re-armed after every non-content event so a post-tool response measures the model's restart, not our tool time), `opengeni_stream_inter_delta_gap_seconds{provider,class}` (gap between consecutive same-class deltas, reset across boundaries), `opengeni_stream_batch_flush_events` + `opengeni_stream_batch_flush_duration_seconds` (the runtime batcher's coalescing shape), `opengeni_session_event_append_seconds` (durable DB write path) and `opengeni_session_event_publish_seconds` (best-effort NATS delivery path) split so a p99 climb points at Postgres vs. NATS, plus `opengeni_model_input_tokens{provider}` and `opengeni_context_compactions_total{trigger}` (the context-pressure pair that makes "compaction never firing while contexts run hot" queryable). All labels are bounded — never a session id or raw user-supplied model string. `appendAndPublishEvents` gains an optional timing observer (no new dependency on the observability package) and `createRuntimeBatcher` an optional `onFlush` hook; both fire on success and failure.
- 4fbd8a1: Treat transient upstream model-provider failures as retryable so a goal-bearing session recovers automatically instead of going terminal. A provider 5xx (500/502/503/529), a generic "server had a bad minute" body, or a dropped/again-able network connection (ECONNRESET/ETIMEDOUT/EAI_AGAIN/…) now classifies `retryable` and routes into the existing idle + goal-continuation path (auto-continue after the backpressure delay for goal-bearing sessions; wait for the next user message otherwise). Previously only 429/rate-limit and MCP-timeout were retryable, so a generic provider 5xx fell through to a hard `session.failed` that required a manual nudge — during an upstream provider degradation window this needlessly hard-failed a fleet of live sessions. HTTP status is authoritative (every 5xx retryable, 4xx still hard-fails); the ChatGPT/Codex usage-cap 429 stays non-retryable since a retry would just re-hit the cap.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e7a243: Support PRIVATE-registry Modal sandbox images via `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`.

  The Agents-extension Modal backend resolves `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REF` (and any pack
  `sandboxImage` that overrides it) with `Image.fromRegistry(tag)` and no secret, so it could
  only pull PUBLIC images. New optional setting `modalImageRegistrySecret` (env
  `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`) names a Modal Secret holding `REGISTRY_USERNAME` +
  `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`; when set, the runtime resolves that Secret and pre-builds
  `fromRegistry(tag, secret)` ONCE per worker process (`ensureModalRegistryImage`, awaited in
  `createOpenGeniWorker` boot) and the Modal provider selects it via
  `ModalImageSelector.fromImage(...)`. When unset the behavior is byte-identical to today's
  public-image path (and the modal SDK is never loaded for it). Resume/attach turns never pull
  the image, so they are unaffected.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- b34b912: Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

  Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

  When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.
