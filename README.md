Opengeni is a production-ready agentic service: it runs AI agents that do real work, keeps a session going for hours or days, records every step in a replayable event log, stops for a human when an action needs approval, and puts each session either in a managed sandbox or directly on a machine you own.

Opengeni is not the agent; it is everything the agent needs around it. Give agents work from the web app and follow along, or call the same session API from your own product and let Opengeni hold the state, history, approvals, and outputs. It grew out of two years of running agents against production cloud infrastructure at [Cloudgeni](https://cloudgeni.ai).

## Get started

**The fastest way is the managed service.** Sign up at [app.opengeni.ai](https://app.opengeni.ai), name your organization, connect a model (a ChatGPT/Codex or SuperGrok subscription, a provider key, or prepaid credits), and start your first session. Nothing to deploy. The [quickstart](https://docs.opengeni.ai/quickstart) walks through it.

Prefer to run it yourself? Everything is open source. Jump to [Run it locally](#run-it-locally) for a one-command dev stack, or to [Self-host](https://docs.opengeni.ai/guides/self-host) for production.

## Features

- **Durable, replayable sessions.** Every event lands in Postgres. Live streams backfill from it, so a browser reload, a new client, or an audit replays the same history.
- **Sessions that finish the job.** Give a session a goal with success criteria. The agent keeps working until it completes the goal with evidence, pauses with a rationale, or a human interrupts.
- **Humans in the loop.** Tool approvals gate risky actions. Agents can ask structured questions and resume the exact tool call after the answer, even across restarts.
- **Run anywhere.** A managed sandbox (Docker, Modal, or a cloud provider) or a **Connected Machine**: your laptop, build server, or GPU box, enrolled once and driven directly. Machines only dial out and receive no Opengeni credentials.
- **Agent Knowledge.** Files, retained sources, and useful findings in one searchable library, with personal and workspace ownership and optional review before anything is published.
- **Integrate into your product.** Embed the full conversation with the `SessionConversation` React component behind a packaged, tenant- and user-scoped proxy on your server. Your organization API key stays there.
- **Managed or self-hosted.** Use [app.opengeni.ai](https://app.opengeni.ai) with nothing to run, or deploy the same API, web app, workers, Helm chart, and reference Terraform for Azure, AWS, and GCP yourself. All of it is Apache-2.0.

## Run it locally

For development, or to evaluate Opengeni before self-hosting. You need [Bun at the exact version in `.bun-version`](.bun-version), Git, curl, Docker, [rustup](https://rustup.rs), a C compiler (Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS or `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu), and an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni.git
cd opengeni
cp .env.example .env   # add your model credentials
bun run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000, describe a task, and watch the session run.

`bun run dev` installs dependencies, starts Postgres, NATS, Temporal, and object storage, runs migrations, and starts the API, workers, and web app. By default the agent runs commands directly on your machine (the `local` sandbox), not in an isolated container, so the API and web app listen only on 127.0.0.1. Set `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=docker` to run the agent in the local sandbox image instead. See [Local development](docs/local-development.md) for manual startup, configuration, network exposure, and the native (no Docker) path.

## Use it from your code and product

The default integration embeds the full OpenGeni conversation in your product: `SessionConversation` in the browser, backed by the session SDK through `createSessionProxyHandler` on your server. Verify your installed SDK and target deployment support it, set the API URL explicitly, and follow the [product integration guide](https://docs.opengeni.ai/guides/integrate-your-product) for authentication and explicit user onboarding.

```ts
// Server, mounted at /api/opengeni/*. The organization API key stays here.
import { OpenGeniClient, createSessionProxyHandler } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const og = new OpenGeniClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});

export const handleOpenGeni = createSessionProxyHandler(og, {
  resolve: async (request) => {
    const me = await authenticate(request); // your product's own auth
    if (!me) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    return { workspaceId: me.openGeniWorkspaceId, user: me.userId, source: "acme" };
  },
});
```

```tsx
// Browser
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";
import { OpenGeniProvider, SessionConversation } from "@opengeni/react";
import "@opengeni/react/compiled.css";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/api/opengeni" });
<OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
  <SessionConversation sessionId={sessionId} />
</OpenGeniProvider>;
```

Your server maps tenants with `ensureWorkspace`, onboards users with `addExternalWorkspaceMember`, and creates sessions with explicit tools. If your product already has a Vercel `useChat` or OpenAI-shaped chat UI, `createChatHandler` from `@opengeni/sdk/chat` is a text-only fallback backend for it.

Start with the [product integration guide](docs/product-integration.md), then the [TypeScript SDK](packages/sdk/README.md) and [React components](packages/react/README.md). The [chat quickstart](examples/chat-quickstart) is a runnable server example of the chat fallback, and [Northstar support](examples/northstar-support) is a runnable SaaS embed of the default path with a product MCP server.

## How it works

"Agent" is one word for at least ten different jobs. A model is a function from tokens to tokens: it forgets everything between calls, has no idea what it is allowed to do, and has no obligation to keep working until the job is done. Everything above it exists to turn that into work that finishes, can be trusted with real systems, and can be explained afterwards.

Opengeni is built as those layers.

```

**Rent the edges, own the middle.** Models, provider APIs, and the raw compute box change too fast to own, so every one of them is a swappable boundary. Durable state, governance, and knowledge are where your workflows, permissions, audit record, and institutional memory actually live, so they sit in a Postgres database you operate, export, and can leave with.

The public product docs live at [docs.opengeni.ai](https://docs.opengeni.ai), and the thinking behind the layers above is on the [Opengeni blog](https://opengeni.substack.com/). The [Cloudgeni Infrastructure Agents Guide](https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/infrastructure-agents-guide) covers patterns for infrastructure-focused agents.
