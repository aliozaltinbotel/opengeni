# consumers (apps/web, apps/api, apps/worker, sibling packages) resolve via
# source — CI typechecks and builds the images from src BEFORE any dist exists.
# External npm consumers, however, must load the built JS + .d.ts, so the
# published tarball has to point at `./dist/...`. This swap runs after the tsup
# build above produced dist/, in the ephemeral CI checkout only, and is never
