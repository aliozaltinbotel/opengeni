# Backend chat quickstart

A server-only example of `createChatHandler` from `@opengeni/sdk/chat`.
There is no bundled chat frontend. For the full React agent experience, use
the existing `SessionConversation`, or compose `MessageTimeline` and
`ChatComposer` with the normal session SDK and your authenticated backend.
Those components do not consume this simplified chat-handler protocol.

## Run

Before running, an organization owner or admin must enable **Only me chats**
in the web app under **Organization settings > Security & data**. If the
setting is unavailable, ask the installation operator to activate private
chats first. The chat facade defaults to private chats; the chat handler
never enables this organization setting. Until it is enabled, chat requests
fail closed with `OPENGENI_SETUP_REQUIRED` (`OpenGeniSetupError` in the SDK)
instead of creating a chat or changing the setting.

```bash
cd examples/chat-quickstart
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set OPENGENI_API_KEY (a full-access organization key).
bun run server
```

There is no onboarding step. The demo tenant's workspace is created on first
use, and Opengeni adds the product user `u_42` to it on their first request
with conversation permissions (the organization key needs `members:manage`,
which full access includes). The organization id is derived from the key.

Send a message with the demo-only identity header:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:4200/api/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-demo-user: u_42' \
  -H 'x-opengeni-conversation: c_1' \
  -d '{"message":"Hello"}'
```

This executes an agent and may incur usage charges. `GET /api/chat` with the
same headers restores history and pending decisions; `POST /api/chat/respond`
answers a pending decision. Replace the spoofable demo identity header with
real server-side authentication before exposing this server to other users;
it listens on 127.0.0.1 only.

Conversation ids are not namespaced per user: Opengeni authorization decides
who may open a conversation, so a real product also checks that the
authenticated user may use the conversation id the page sends.

## Wire formats

The handler streams native chat chunks by default. It also supports the
existing `vercel`, `openai-chat`, and `openai-responses` adapters. These are
partial chat-protocol adapters, not full SDK or tool-result parity. See the
[product integration guide](../../docs/product-integration.md).
