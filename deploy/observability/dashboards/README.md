# OpenGeni Grafana dashboards

Dashboards-as-code for the OpenGeni control plane. Seven boards, each answering a
different "manage and fix problems as soon as they arise" question:

| File | Board | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `streaming-health.json` | **OpenGeni · Streaming Health** | Is streaming sluggish, and *where* — the model, durable append, NATS publish, batching, or SSE connection/reconnect path? The TTFT chart carries the same 8-second warning line as the bundled alert. |
| `connected-machines.json` | **OpenGeni · Connected Machines** | Are Connected Machine control ops healthy — op outcomes, healed faults (the leading indicator), op latency, the fault taxonomy, and the payload wall? |
| `worker-fleet.json` | **OpenGeni · Worker Fleet** | Is the fleet keeping up — turns inflight/queued, worker memory vs. limit, HPA replicas, sandbox leases, and whether compaction is firing against context pressure? |
| `sandbox-health.json` | **OpenGeni · Sandbox Health** | Are provider operations, creates, lease recovery, checkpoint GC, deadline rotation, draining, and retained-process reconciliation healthy? |
| `turn-startup.json` | **OpenGeni · Turn Startup** | Where does queue-to-first-byte time go — worker queue, sandbox/rig/repository/file/tool/model preparation, provider dispatch, or provider response? |
| `google-drive-sync.json` | **OpenGeni · Google Drive Sync** | Are scheduled Drive runs succeeding within their persisted quotas, or failing on provider retry, reconnect, and explicit resource limits? |
| `runtime-failures.json` | **OpenGeni · Runtime Failures** | Are alerts firing, scrape targets healthy, synthetic probes fresh, turn workers restarting, recovery exhausted, turns failing or recovering, MCP connections or tool calls broken or slow, sandboxes/providers failing, the API returning 5xx, or the durable write path saturated? |

All seven are theme-agnostic, tagged `opengeni` + `observability`, and carry a
`$datasource` template variable — pick your Prometheus datasource on import; no UID
is hardcoded. The Turn Startup dashboard additionally requires one exact
`$namespace`, `$environment`, and `$release` selection so a shared Prometheus
cannot combine separate OpenGeni deployments. Its first-byte latency quantiles
contain successful samples only; the adjacent availability panel separately
shows canonical durable logical turns that terminate failed without a first byte
across generic and subscription transports.

The dashboards offer 30-day views, but a selector cannot manufacture retained
history. The production example's 30-day time limit plus 80 GB size limit does
not guarantee 30 days: Prometheus applies whichever limit is reached first.
Size local storage from measured ingestion or use remote write before relying
on the full window.

## Importing

**Grafana UI** — Dashboards → New → Import → Upload JSON file (or paste), then select
your Prometheus datasource for the `$datasource` prompt.

**Provisioned (file provider)** — mount this directory and point a provider at it:

```yaml
# /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/opengeni.yaml
apiVersion: 1
providers:
  - name: opengeni
    type: file
    options:
      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/opengeni
      foldersFromFilesStructure: true
```

**OpenGeni Kubernetes observability wrapper** — install the chart rooted at
`deploy/observability`. It renders one deterministic ConfigMap per file directly
from this directory, labels it for the Grafana sidecar, records the content hash
and source revision, and installs the pinned Prometheus/Grafana stack. See
[`../README.md`](../README.md).

**Existing Kubernetes sidecar** — if the cluster already has a compatible Grafana
sidecar, wrap each file in a ConfigMap carrying the sidecar's discovery label
(default `grafana_dashboard: "1"`). The wrapper chart can provision only these
ConfigMaps with `kube-prometheus-stack.enabled=false`; manual creation remains a
fallback for non-Helm installations. Example:

```bash
kubectl create configmap opengeni-streaming-health \
  --from-file=streaming-health.json \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml \
  | kubectl label --local -f - grafana_dashboard=1 -o yaml \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Metric sources

Most panels read **app-emitted** series scraped from OpenGeni's `/metrics` endpoints.

Runtime Failures includes **Sandbox visibility-check failures**, separating an
invisible destination, unsuccessful shell exit, still-running check, invalid
confirmation, and a thrown provider error. These are bounded reason categories,
not raw error-message labels. Exact checked path, workspace root, command,
returned output, exit code, and yielded provider handle are preserved in the
authenticated `turn.failed` or `turn.recovery.requested` event's
`materializationDiagnostic` field. Provider errors keep their existing recovery
classification. Use the
session events API with `payloadMode=full` to retrieve them. The detail-only
`failureDiagnostics` summary is intentionally smaller than that event.
An unfinished check is not evidence that a directory is absent. This telemetry
does not retry materialization or an agent turn, and a later successful Continue
does not prove the earlier cause. Existing historical generic failures cannot
be enriched retrospectively with output that was never retained.

Modal's fixed visibility probe observes its own provider output cursor rather
than a retained agent command. Its bounded observation deadline remains a
`command_pending` failure, not proof of a missing path or process termination.
When known, `materializationDiagnostic.providerExecution` preserves the exact
sandbox/task/exec identity for investigation; it is not a durable command alias.
Neither those identities nor raw output enter public metric labels.

Enable scraping via the chart:

```yaml
observability:
  metrics: { enabled: true }
  serviceMonitor: { enabled: true }   # api + worker + relay ServiceMonitors
  prometheusRule: { enabled: true }   # the starter alerts (see ../../helm/opengeni/templates/prometheusrule.yaml)
```

Some Worker Fleet panels and recording rules also read **cluster-infra** series:
container working sets from cAdvisor/kubelet; pod, phase, resource-limit, HPA,
and node-readiness data from kube-state-metrics; memory/I/O PSI, swap, and node
identity from node-exporter; and runtime errors plus instance-to-node identity
from kubelet. If an exporter is absent, the dependent cluster panels and alerts
are empty. The app-emitted memory-guard panels remain available without a
container memory limit and expose both whole-host and effective finite-cgroup
headroom directly from the turn worker.

Sandbox inventory metrics are complete database projections emitted by whichever
control replica executes the global reaper activity. Never sum those replicated/stale
samples directly. The chart's `opengeni:*:fresh_max` recording rules first require the
matching projection domain to have refreshed on the same scrape target within the
configured freshness window (five minutes by default), then take the authoritative
maximum. Helm rejects a freshness window shorter than three configured sandbox-reaper
periods. A blank recorded series is an inventory
telemetry failure, not a healthy zero; `OpenGeniSandboxInventoryProjectionStale`
alerts on that condition.

Sandbox Health also shows `opengeni_sandbox_provider_missing_before_capture_total`
by bounded backend. It increments only after an exact lease commits cold with
`providerMissingBeforeCapture=true` (not on a failed probe, stale claim, or
duplicate drain). `OpenGeniModalProviderMissingBeforeCapture` alerts on an
observed Modal loss independently of the overdue rotation inventory; the
first-observation arm covers a new counter with just one scrape sample. This
does not assert that all files were lost: an earlier published archive may be
restorable. Inspect the authenticated `sandbox.box.terminated` event and the
lease recovery state for the affected sandbox. Neither provider identity nor
workspace/session identifiers are metric labels. Deadline-specific
legacy-process-blocked inventory is not exposed by the current backlog
projection; a separate DB projection is needed before an alert can distinguish
that condition from the existing `process_blocked` count.
`OpenGeniSandboxDeadlineProcessBlocked` warns on that general count after ten
minutes while the provider is still available; it does not claim the blocker
is a legacy command or that the rotation has already failed.

The Modal checkpoint fallback panel and
`OpenGeniModalCheckpointFallbackSelected` warning read the separate
`opengeni_sandbox_checkpoint_fallback_total{backend="modal",outcome=~"selected|selected_shared"}`
counter (`selected_shared` when the whole sandbox group received the
checkpoint). A selection is recorded after a durable authorization receipt and
before restore; it remains an operator signal even if the session later
continues successfully. It is not proof of restore success or of complete
file recovery. Both loss and fallback panels retain namespace/release/environment
identity so a shared Prometheus cannot attribute one deployment's loss to
another. The warning covers the first scrape sample of a newly created counter
without using session or provider identifiers as metric labels.
The separate durable observations panel reads a fresh, release-scoped count
from committed audit receipts over the same 30-minute window. It keeps the
operator alert visible if a worker exits after committing recovery but before
its process-local counter can be scraped.

The Modal empty-workspace continuity panel and
`OpenGeniModalFreshWorkspaceContinuity` warning read the same counter with
`outcome="fresh_workspace"`, plus the durable `fresh_workspace_selected`
observation kind. It fires when a definitively lost group had no usable
checkpoint and continued on a new empty workspace after every member received
its warning receipt. It is an operator signal, not a failure: investigate why no
restorable checkpoint existed (capture cadence, deadline rotation, restore
failures); the lost archive and checkpoint references remain on the lease.

> `machine.link.*` and `machine.op.*` are session-scoped **timeline events**, not
> Prometheus series — a machine's link history lives in the session timeline (which
> carries the workspace/session context Prometheus omits). The Connected Machines
> board is the aggregate op-outcome view.

Runtime Failures also shows **Turn cleanup in progress** by bounded stage and
**Slow turn cleanup stages**. These describe physical cleanup after agent
execution ends, including already-completed logical turns. Inspect the exact
Temporal activity heartbeat (`phase=finalizing`, `finalizationStage`, and
`finalizationStageStartedAt`) to correlate a session. A single cleanup stage
stalled for five minutes triggers worker containment without claiming remote
writer quiescence or retrying the completed logical turn. The slow-stage counter
records a thirty-second observation while the worker remains scrapeable; a slow
stage may still finish. Exact containment exits are recorded in the bounded log
and should be correlated with worker restarts, not inferred from that counter.
