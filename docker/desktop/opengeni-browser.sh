# Opengeni canonical browser launcher — the SINGLE container-safe entrypoint for
# Chrome, shared by BOTH launch paths:
#   - the HUMAN path: XFCE panel/menu "Web Browser" -> exo-open --launch WebBrowser
#     -> (helpers.rc WebBrowser=opengeni-browser) -> this wrapper; AND the
#     debian x-www-browser alternative also points here.
#   - the AGENT computer-use path: launched the same way (one wrapper, one flag set).
#
# WHY a wrapper (the bug it fixes): the box runs as ROOT (uid=0). Google Chrome
# REFUSES to start as root without --no-sandbox ("Running as root without
# --no-sandbox is not supported", zygote_host_impl_linux.cc), exits 1, and exo
# surfaces its generic "Failed to execute default Web Browser. Input/output error."
# The stock debian-sensible-browser helper runs google-chrome-stable with NO flags,
# so the menu browser hard-fails. This wrapper supplies the container-safe flags so
# the human menu path launches reliably — exactly the flags proven live to load a page.
#
# Flags:
#   --no-sandbox            : MANDATORY — box runs as root; Chrome's setuid/zygote
#                             sandbox cannot initialize as uid 0 (single-tenant
#                             disposable sandbox, so dropping the sandbox is acceptable).
#   --test-type             : suppresses Chrome's yellow "You are using an unsupported
#                             command-line flag: --no-sandbox. Stability and security
#                             will suffer." infobar. --no-sandbox is required here (root
#                             in container), so the warning is pure noise; --test-type
#                             dismisses the unsupported-flag bar WITHOUT changing browser
#                             behavior (it does not relax sandboxing or any other policy).
#   --disable-dev-shm-usage : Modal /dev/shm is tiny; force Chrome to use a temp dir
#                             instead of shared memory (avoids renderer crashes).
#   --disable-gpu           : headless Xvfb has no GPU; avoids GL init churn/spam.
#   --user-data-dir         : a FIXED, WRITABLE profile dir under /tmp (NOT /workspace)
#                             so the profile never trips an I/O error on the mounted
#                             /workspace and survives a HOME with odd perms.
#   --no-first-run / --no-default-browser-check : skip first-run UI nags in a kiosk box.

# Layer 5). The real Google Chrome deb installs its launcher at the fixed absolute path
