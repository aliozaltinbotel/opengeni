# Northstar support agent example

A small fictional customer-support SaaS showing the complete OpenGeni
integration as a clear before/after:

1. Open the product with OpenGeni off and use it as a small support SaaS:
   search and filter the queue, switch between four tickets, inspect customer
   signals, change fields, add internal notes, and reply.
2. Turn on the frontend-only **OpenGeni** switch to embed the agent workspace in
   the same product.
3. The product backend onboards the demo operator as an external workspace
   member, creates each OpenGeni session as that user with an explicit tool
   selection and a stable idempotency key, and mounts the SDK's packaged
   `createSessionProxyHandler` at `/api/opengeni/*`. The organization API key
   stays server-side, and the browser can reach only the conversation routes.
4. OpenGeni calls the product's authenticated Streamable HTTP MCP server.
5. MCP tools read and mutate the same ticket data used by the human workflow.
6. Product SSE updates the ticket immediately while OpenGeni SSE updates the
   agent timeline independently.
7. The panel is the default embed: `<OpenGeniProvider>` plus
   `<SessionConversation>`, with Northstar tool renderers and Markdown. Runs use
   the deployment's default model; the composer's model picker changes it per
   turn.
8. The panel uses the SDK's `data-og-density="compact"` preset. Typography and
   composer sizing come from public `--og-*` tokens; the demo only supplies
   Northstar colors and product-specific layout.

The demo deliberately exposes four tools over the selected ticket: `get_ticket`,
`get_customer`, `update_ticket`, and `add_internal_note`. Mutations are
pre-approved and idempotent so the full loop is easy to demonstrate.

The example depends on `@opengeni/sdk` and `@opengeni/react` through
`workspace:*`, so a repository checkout always runs against the current SDK and
component source rather than a stale published copy.

## Run against managed OpenGeni

Requirements: Bun, an organization API key authorized for the configured
organization workspace, and a public HTTPS tunnel for the MCP endpoint.

The built-in organization API-key scope includes `workspace:admin`, which
implies the ordinary workspace capabilities this example uses, including
external-member onboarding (`members:manage`), sessions, files, and MCP
attachment. The server grants the fixed demo operator (`maya.chen`, source
`northstar-demo`) only `workspace:read`, `sessions:*`, `files:*`, and
`mcp_servers:attach` (its sessions carry a per-session MCP server). It still does not imply the literal
`secrets:read` permission. These are workspace capabilities, not browser-origin
registrations; file bytes still travel through short-lived signed storage URLs.

```bash
cd examples/northstar-support
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_ID, OPENGENI_API_KEY, and a random MCP token.
bun run server
```

In a second terminal, expose only the MCP port:

```bash
ngrok http 4101
```

In a third terminal:

```bash
cd examples/northstar-support
bun run dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3101>. If not using ngrok, set
`OPENGENI_DEMO_MCP_URL` to any public HTTPS origin or full `/mcp` endpoint.

## What to inspect

- `src/server.ts`: explicit onboarding, server-side session creation, the
  packaged session proxy, MCP tools, dummy domain state, and product SSE.
- `src/support-agent-panel.tsx`: `OpenGeniProvider` + `SessionConversation`.
- `src/support-tool-renderers.tsx`: product-specific rendering of MCP activity.
- `src/use-support-demo.ts`: product SSE plus missed-event reconciliation.

This is a local integration example, not a production auth template: its proxy
`resolve` hook returns one fixed operator. A real SaaS should authenticate its
users in `resolve`, pass its CSRF check as `authorizeMutation`, authorize each product resource and
OpenGeni workspace mapping, deploy MCP on its backend, store secrets in a secret
manager, and rate-limit both its session and tool endpoints. See
[`docs/product-integration.md`](../../docs/product-integration.md),
[`docs/session-mcp-servers.md`](../../docs/session-mcp-servers.md), and
[`packages/sdk/README.md`](../../packages/sdk/README.md).
