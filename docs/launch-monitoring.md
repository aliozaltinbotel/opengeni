# Launch monitoring: first actions

Open **Grafana → Launch**, choose the environment, and use the last 15 minutes.
Read the overview first: probe freshness, first-turn success, failures, eligible
backlog, first response, API errors and memory. Expand the matching subsystem
only when a headline is unhealthy. **No data, stale telemetry and no traffic
are not green.** Use the environment's delivery record for the dashboard and
alert-channel links; staging is a production rehearsal, not production evidence.

## Alert → first action

| Alert family / signal | Meaning and first action |
| --- | --- |
| Synthetic failed / stale | Signup, authentication, first message or reply is broken, or the probe stopped. Read its failing stage and last success; check the live model catalog, trial balance and scheduler. A successful `/healthz` does not prove a turn works. |
| First-turn success / turn failure ratio | New users or durable turns are failing. Split by failure class/provider and compare the first-response availability signal; distinguish expected user cancellation from infrastructure failures. |
| Eligible backlog / schedule-to-start / slots | Runnable work cannot start promptly. Check monitor freshness, Temporal queues, memory-safe worker slots and HPA desired/current/max replicas. Paused prompts and provider-capacity waits are not worker-eligible backlog. |
| TTFT / queue-to-first-byte / provider TTFT regression | Responses start slowly. First split ownership: queue-to-provider-dispatch and per-request pre-dispatch alerts are **Opengeni** latency (queue, claim/DB contention, sandbox, tools, history/audit checkpoints) - open Turn Startup and Postgres append latency. `OpenGeniModelProviderTtftRegression` means a provider got slower than its own 24h baseline after dispatch - check provider status and the Streaming Health split panels. Absolute TTFT on reasoning models is legitimately long and does not alert. Phase durations overlap and must not be summed. Failed turns with no token are availability failures, not fast latency samples. |
| API route refusals / missing permission / handoff attach refused | Users are being refused (401/403/409/422) on one route far above its own baseline, or a route refuses most of its traffic. Open **Capabilities, browser & handoffs**, then the API `HTTP request completed` logs for that route: `rejectionCode` is the public error code, `rejectionReason` names the missing permission (`permission:stream:view`), domain code, or Connected Machine control failure, and `rejectionFingerprint` groups identical refusals (resolve it with `bun run scripts/resolve-rejection-fingerprint.ts`). Fix the grant or the client that offers an action the user cannot take; do not mute the route. |
| Browser/computer operations, handoffs, connect, OAuth callbacks, agent tools, Connected Machines | A product capability is failing for users: Browser/Computer operations by `reason`, human handoffs expiring unanswered, Connect attempts or provider OAuth callbacks failing by `provider`/`stage`/`reason`, agent tool families mostly erroring, Connected Machines refused at connect, or attached browsers unreachable. Split the named metric by its bounded labels (see `docs/deployment.md` product-failure metrics) before touching providers or credentials. |
| API 5xx / read latency | The control plane is degraded. Split by bounded route/status; inspect API memory, DB CPU/connections, append latency and retained logs before increasing API replicas. |
| OOM / restarts / memory near limit | A process died or is approaching its limit. Inspect pod last termination reason, working set versus limit, node pressure and the release revision. Capture logs first; coordinate mitigation with the reliability/capacity owner rather than repeatedly restarting. |
| Worker/HPA/node saturation | Autoscaling is at a ceiling or infrastructure is unhealthy. Check pending pods, node CPU/memory, requests/limits and autoscaler events. Extra replicas will not fix a DB or provider quota bottleneck. |
| Database CPU / connections / append latency | Postgres is saturated or unavailable. Inspect active connections, blocking queries and durable-write latency. Do not replay uncertain writes or raise connection pools blindly. |
| NATS / Temporal / scrape unhealthy | Delivery or orchestration is degraded, or its monitor is missing. Check dependency targets and pods. Postgres remains durable truth; replayable NATS delivery is not commit evidence. |
| Modal create failure / latency / capacity | Sandbox provisioning is failing, slow or nearing an independently confirmed plan limit. Inspect bounded category/stage, inventory freshness and concurrent provider usage. Exclude expected lease transitions; reconcile unknown create outcomes before retrying. |
| Provider failures / 429 / pool or quota | Model capacity or credentials are failing. Separate Azure OpenAI, Codex and Claude; check the affected model's deployment/quota or subscription pool. Missing quota telemetry is unknown, not spare capacity; never rotate credentials as an incident shortcut. |
| Credits / checkout / frontend errors | Funding, checkout or the browser journey is failing. Compare server checkout outcomes with the content-free browser beacon. Check Stripe availability, webhook processing and balance grants; do not retry a charge without its provider receipt. |
| Alert delivery failed / logs stale / cap reached | Monitoring itself has lost coverage. Check receiver failures and notification receipts, or Container Insights ingestion/DCR and workspace cap. Restore coverage before interpreting absent errors as healthy. |

## Evidence and operating rules

- Warning alerts need sustained, traffic-gated evidence; critical/page alerts
  use the configured urgent route. Group related symptoms by environment;
  keep repeat notifications bounded. Do not silence a real unresolved incident
  just to make the dashboard green.
- Verify delivery with a uniquely labelled test through the **actual alert
  route** and an observed message in the channel, then resolve the test.
  Receiver configuration or a direct Slack post alone is not delivery proof.
- Run signup-to-reply probes every few minutes with fresh sessions and
  synthetic classification; require reply content, not merely idle state.
  Record stage coverage, last success, cadence, failure and recovery. An
  API-key-only model canary does not cover signup or browser authentication.
- Retained production logs must be queried back from their configured sink.
  Check retention, scope, cap and ingestion freshness. Browser beacons contain
  closed kinds/actions, route patterns and bundle revision, **not** raw messages
  or stacks; counts are a bounded lower bound, not complete exception capture.
- Production changes use the reviewed ops repository and Helm-values/workflow
  path. Never apply a locally rendered chart to production. Record exact
  source/deploy revisions, rollback route and post-apply readback.

Configuration and metric semantics: [deployment](deployment.md#observability),
[application observability](application-observability.md),
[Codex rotation](codex-subscription-rotation.md). Thresholds, receivers and
environment-specific dashboards are owned by the deployed ops values/rules;
the delivery record must disclose any unsupported or stale signal.
