# Nested-agent depth policy

OpenGeni enforces an inclusive maximum depth for session trees at the
PostgreSQL session-creation boundary. The policy limits new descendants without
changing the lifecycle or control state of sessions that already exist.

Depth admission is separate from runtime communication authority. Once a child
exists, a live agent may address peer workspace sessions; see
[`agent-session-authority.md`](agent-session-authority.md). Slack-private stays
same-root for agents, and `user_private` still requires the initiating human as
owner. Nested-agent depth does not restore a parent/child access lock.

## Resource inheritance

A child that omits `resources` inherits only the parent's repositories. Uploaded
files are not automatically attached to its initial message. Explicit `resources`
replaces inheritance (including `[]`); include selected file references to attach
them, or pass a file ID in the task for on-demand retrieval. Shared sandbox files
remain accessible on disk; this rule controls session attachments, not filesystem
isolation.

A child does not inherit the parent's Sandbox Environment or Variable Sets. An
omitted `rigId` resolves to the workspace default environment, as for any new
session, and omitted `variableSetIds` attach none. When that differs from the
parent's box, the omitted-`sandbox` default gives the child its own box instead
of sharing. An agent that needs the parent's credentials or setup in a child
names them explicitly in `session_create` (`rigId`, `variableSetIds`); the
default worker token holds `variable-sets:attach` and `variable-sets:use`, and
every named set is revalidated for the child's creator. A child with the same
environment and sets as the parent shares the parent's box.

## Depth and precedence

- A root session has depth `0` and its `rootSessionId` is its own id.
- A child has its parent's depth plus one and keeps the same root id.
- The server default is `3`, so depths `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` are allowed;
  attempted depth `4` is denied.
- The effective limit is selected in this order:
  1. an explicit session/agent override (`maxNestedAgentDepth` at create time),
  2. `workspaces.settings.maxNestedAgentDepth`,
  3. the persisted deployment policy from `OPENGENI_MAX_NESTED_AGENT_DEPTH`,
  4. the server default `3`.

An explicit override is an absolute depth, not generations remaining. A caller
may keep or reduce the inherited limit; increasing it requires `workspace:admin`.
An explicit session policy is inherited by future descendants until an authorized
descendant supplies another override. Lineage and policy snapshots are immutable
after creation.

The absolute override remains part of the public REST/SDK create contract for
advanced callers. It is intentionally absent from the model-facing
`session_create` schema: `maxNestedAgentDepth: 0` means “the root-relative limit
is zero,” not “create one child that cannot delegate,” so a non-root manager
would deny the child it is trying to create. A manager creates a non-delegating
leaf by narrowing the child's `firstPartyMcpTools` so it omits
`session_create` (and narrowing permissions when appropriate).

## Authoritative boundary and denials

All production session creation paths converge on `createSession` or
`createSessionWithIdempotencyKeyResult` in `packages/db/src/index.ts`: HTTP,
first-party MCP `session_create`, and scheduled worker creation. The transaction
locks the workspace admission row, reads the persisted deployment policy, locks
the trusted parent when present, resolves the policy, and either inserts the
session or commits one complete denial row.

Denials use `nested_agent_depth_exceeded` (HTTP `409`) or
`nested_agent_depth_override_forbidden` (HTTP `403`). MCP returns the same
structured envelope as an `isError` tool result. The durable
`session_spawn_denials` row contains the policy/depth snapshot and idempotency
key. A denied create creates no session, turn, event, workflow wake, sandbox,
usage, billing, or scheduled-run artifact. Reusing a non-null create idempotency
key replays the same denial id, even if the request or mutable policy changes.

At turn preparation, the worker signs the session's current and effective
maximum depths into its delegated first-party token. When both trusted facts
show that the current depth is already exhausted, the API omits
`session_create` from that attempt's model-visible catalog. The claims are
optional for rolling compatibility, and PostgreSQL admission remains the
authoritative fallback for an older worker, stale catalog, or concurrent policy
change.

## Workspace and scheduled-task policy

Workspace administrators can set `maxNestedAgentDepth` through workspace
settings; sending `null` clears the workspace override and restores deployment
fallback. Deployment migrations persist the environment value (or default `3`)
in `nested_agent_depth_configuration`; runtime admission never trusts a stale
process setting once that row exists.

Scheduled task overrides are checked for `workspace:admin` only when an increase
over the current inherited limit is requested. The authorized task configuration
is durable: later scheduled dispatches preserve its explicit override under a
narrowed workspace or deployment fallback. Depth is orthogonal to budgets,
concurrency, Pause/Resume, and model-call limits.

## Rolling migration

Migration `0108` fences invalidated warming epochs. The nested-agent repair
then uses `0109` expand, `0110` mixed-version boundary, `0111` backfill, `0112`
NOT VALID checks, `0113` validation, `0114` metadata-only finalization, `0115`
foreign-key validation, and `0116` concurrent indexing. Existing trees remain
readable, including legacy trees deeper than the current policy. New
descendants are admitted only when their attempted depth is within their
selected immutable policy, or when an authorized explicit override raises
that policy.
