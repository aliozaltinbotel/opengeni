# Compact session monitoring over MCP

## Child unread and consumption

Unread is based on completed assistant messages, substantive final answers,
and actionable failures/input/goal facts, not the raw event cursor. The same
predicate drives child rows and ancestor counts. Completed commentary
(`phase: "commentary"`) is progress, so it never creates a dot on its own; the
answer or outcome that follows does. A turn that a human or API message started
and that ended waiting for input (`wait_for_input`) has no output, but the
`reply` its `turn.completed` records answers that message, so it does create a
dot. Migration 0527 indexes exactly that predicate; the 0503 index only serves
older API processes during the rollout. A `session_wait` summary or a compact
`session_events` `latest: "terminal"` result of such a `turn.completed` shows
only the empty output, so neither counts as consuming the reply.
Raw deltas, status snapshots,
`sandbox.box.terminated`, `workspace.revision.captured`, rejected late events,
duplicates and maintenance/continuation completion markers do not create dots.
The public `lastSequence` and replay/pagination cursors still include all events.

Claimed lifecycle notices carry at most 32 whole event snapshots within an 8 KiB
evidence budget, captured when the notice is created. Claim validates the retained
source content before acknowledging it for the receiving turn's frozen human.
An indexed materialized query takes the newest 32 meaningful candidates before
payload size/completeness checks; the input budget favors the newest whole result.
Each source payload is decoded using its own stored codec version before the
logical 8 KiB evidence budget, parent rendering, or equality checks. The query's
64 KiB raw inspection cap is only a bounded-read safeguard. Outbox/update payloads
have their own independent versions; null-version legacy marker text stays literal.
It never advances to the child's current cursor. A legacy terminal status notice
without answer content is not proof that the parent consumed an answer. An idle
terminal result that carries the child's untruncated `finalAnswer` needs no
separate evidence: claim verifies that answer, and each
`finalAnswer.goalContinuations` entry, against the child's retained
`turn.completed` events instead. A truncated answer acknowledges nothing until a
complete read (see [`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md)).

For a live exact parent attempt, `session_events` and `session_wait` also
acknowledge complete returned content for that same frozen human and a real
direct child. Sessionless operators, service turns, siblings and grandchildren
do not gain this behavior. `session_get` and status-only reads never acknowledge.
A proven complete final answer acknowledges cumulatively through that exact
event sequence, including earlier commentary/progress summarized by the final.
It never acknowledges a newer unseen answer. Other filtered reads advance only a
contiguous meaningful prefix and cannot skip unseen work. Truncated/omitted results,
fragment tails and lossy summaries cannot clear unseen content. Fragment reads
are not accumulated as consumption receipts; use an explicit human mark-read
when a full item cannot fit in one tool response. Wait/compact acknowledgments
are restricted to complete answers; use complete result/debug reads for detailed
failures or human-input content. No read changes append-only history or observes
background-command completion. A complete final-answer read that the parent's
exact live attempt issued as a direct model call (not from a Codemode script) is
recorded on the reading turn. When that attempt completes its turn, the child's
still-pending idle terminal result reporting only answers it received is
superseded (`consumed_by_parent_read`), so it does not start another inference
that repeats them; a result that arrives after that completion is inserted
already consumed, and a pending result for a different answer stays. A read by
an attempt that then fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing; see
[`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md).

An explicit mark-unread records the current raw event position as an intent
fence. Old answer replay and later housekeeping do not clear it; proven consumption
of genuinely newer meaningful activity or an explicit mark-read does. Migration
0503 conservatively fences meaningfully unread, human-touched personal rows at
the migration-time frontier because the old revision did not record whether the
last change was mark-unread, mark-read or follow-up intent, or when that intent
was set. Old historical receipts cannot erase that ambiguous intent. A read final
followed only by bookkeeping is not fenced. Legacy mark-unread intent made only
against housekeeping is indistinguishable from already-read meaningful work and
cannot be separately reconstructed.

Historical bookkeeping-only dots derive away without advancing personal cursors.
Additional proven historical reads can be reconciled in bounded operator batches:

```sh
# Uses the explicitly supplied OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL; never loads dotenv files.
bun scripts/reconcile-child-read-attention.ts --workspace <uuid> --parent <uuid>
# After inspecting the content-free dry-run counts, opt in to the same batch:
bun scripts/reconcile-child-read-attention.ts --workspace <uuid> --parent <uuid> --apply
```

Pass returned `nextAfter` as `--after` while `hasMore`; `--limit` is 1–100.
The script pairs current, nonduplicate first-party call/output events on the same
parent turn, derives its frozen human, verifies whole returned content against
the exact current direct-child event, and uses the same protected monotone writer.
Call, output, and child source payloads are decoded independently by their own
version columns; storage-encoded strings are not treated as delivered answers.
That writer rechecks the frozen human's current shared membership or exact active
Personal-owner pointer inside the removal fence. Replay after removal cannot
recreate deleted personal state; inactive humans remain untouched.
`provenEvents` counts matching evidence, not changed personal rows. Repeating a
pass is safe; proven complete finals can clear preceding commentary without a
separate receipt for every intermediate event.
Unknown provider/tool aliases, Codemode shell output, missing/truncated receipts,
multipart fragments, oversized audit bodies, status-only notices and unmatched
content are unsupported and remain unread. No child is blanket-marked read.

## Conversation and execution history

`session_events` defaults to a conversation projection: actual user text and
completed assistant messages, including completed progress messages, which carry
`phase: "commentary"`. It excludes
raw deltas, tool bodies, and lifecycle diagnostics. Pagination never implicitly
changes view or payload detail. Normal pages default to ten messages within a
16 KiB response budget, preferring fewer complete messages; oversized messages
expose an explicit continuation rather than silently
discarding the remainder. Keep the returned cursor and read forward instead of
repeatedly requesting the whole tail.

The explicit `results` view selects final answers and actionable outcomes without
duplicating an answer from both message and turn-completion records. `tools`
provides compact tool receipts, with arguments/output requested explicitly and
call-ID drill-down for detail. `debug` exposes explicitly requested audit and
diagnostic records, including retained deltas. The underlying audit records remain
append-only; these views are read projections, not model-history reconstruction.
Unclaimed queued prompts must not appear as conversation the agent has processed.

Use `session_get`/`session_wait` for status and joining workers, and
`command_read`/`command_wait` for command-specific output. `session_events` does
not mark any command completion observed, even when a diagnostic read includes
its output or exit event.

`sessions_list` and `session_get` default to `detail: "compact"`. This is a
model-facing projection change only: REST session/queue reads, SDK session
objects, topology, and UI defaults keep their existing shapes. The workspace
tool gateway and Codemode invoke the same MCP handlers and receive the same
projection. Clients that need the previous MCP fields must request
`detail: "full"` explicitly.

`session_get({})` reads only the authenticated current agent session: a child
reads itself, never its parent or root. Omission requires exact agent-attempt
claims and still validates that the attempt is live before reading state.
Sessionless/operator callers must provide an explicit `sessionId`; non-agent
session metadata is not sufficient. Explicit IDs keep the same private-session
and optional host authorization checks. This applies to compact and full mode,
not to conversation-history reconstruction. REST/SDK session reads still need
explicit IDs. Fresh attempt catalogs and generated Codemode declarations derive
the optional field from the canonical MCP schema; frozen catalogs stay frozen.

## Discovery

An ordinary `sessions_list` row has exactly `id`, `title`, `status`, and
`updatedAt`. A non-null `parentSessionId` appears only when related-session
authorization permits it. A goal adds `{ status, summary }`; paused and completed
goals remain visible as well as active ones, so session `idle` cannot be mistaken
for goal completion. Use `session_get` for the goal's evidence or pause rationale.
A meaningful effective pause adds `pause.state`, the primary `source` when
present, and a positive `additionalBlockerCount` when there are further blockers.
An active session with no blockers has no `pause` field.

Roots with descendants needing action, paused descendants, or failed descendants
include only the positive counts in `attention`. If the bounded tree walk was
truncated, `attention.truncated: true` signals that counts are lower bounds even
when no attention was found in the visited prefix. No zero-valued child tree is
returned on an ordinary row.

The compact page has `sessions`, `total`, and `nextCursor`. A null cursor means
the traversal is complete. Send each non-null cursor unchanged with the same
filters; cursors retain the exact timestamp (including PostgreSQL microseconds),
revision, rank, snapshot, and filter binding. `orderBy: "updatedAt"` also returns
`updatedThrough`, including on empty pages. This decimal activity revision is the
next incremental scan's `updatedAfter`, not an application timestamp. Creation
order remains the default without search; query/subject default to relevance.

`detail: "full"` selects the previous bounded discovery projection: root flags,
child aggregates, queue counts, nullable fields, per-field loss booleans, and
diagnostic pagination/byte facts. It does **not** return full session
configuration or history.

Related-work evidence is optional:

- Plain compact browse does not read work claims or emit `relatedWork`.
- `includeRelatedWork: true` includes the existing bounded advisory evidence.
- Full mode defaults to evidence; `includeRelatedWork: false` disables its claim
  read on a browse request while retaining the legacy empty evidence shape.
- A nonblank `query` or exact `subject` always enables evidence, even when
  `includeRelatedWork` is false. The operator's discovery rollout switch remains
  authoritative; disabled search fails before discovery storage reads.
- Every returned evidence object preserves literal `advisoryOnly: true` and
  `noAdditionalAccess: true`. Claims are nonexclusive evidence, not locks or
  instructions. See [work discovery](work-discovery.md).

`includeLastMessage: true` adds available bounded previews and a nonzero
`queuedPromptCount`. No human/API prompt is previewed until its turn has been
claimed. Previews share a 16,384-byte UTF-8 budget, spent in database result order.
Omitted previews carry an exact message-type `session_events` drill-down with
`view: "debug"`, `direction: "before"`, `limit: 1`, `mode: "monitoring"`, and
`payloadMode: "summary"`. No-preview is the default.

The final pretty-printed page is limited to 128,000 bytes. Compact responses
emit text truncation flags only for actual text loss, and `responseTruncated`
plus a reason only when rows were removed to fit that byte boundary. Ordinary
count pagination is not truncation. A byte-truncated page resumes after its last
**returned** row, never after a dropped row. An envelope too small for even one
row fails explicitly instead of emitting an unusable cursor.

## Child management

`session_get` compact includes `id`, `title`, `status`, `lastSequence`,
`updatedAt`, and queue counts when a queue snapshot is available. Meaningful
optional fields are:

- `parentSessionId` and `activeTurnId`;
- `goal`: status and summary, plus stored completion `evidence`, pause
  `rationale`, and `pausedReason` when present;
- `progress`: the latest recorded `goal.progress` note with its durable sequence
  and timestamp (not an inferred liveness signal);
- `pause`: the effective primary blocker, including its reason when authorized,
  and the count of additional blockers;
- `wait`: the declared session-level wait reason and absolute deadline;
- `stopping`: positive attempt/background-command settlement counts when present;
- `queue.stoppingPreviousAttempt: true` while the previous attempt has not
  proved quiescence. Counts are visible queued human/API turns and pending
  machine inputs, never their prompts or payloads.

The goal/progress database read selects bounded text prefixes, not whole goal
metadata or event payloads. Progress scalars are decoded with their stored codec
version before presentation. Original Unicode character counts are exact when
known; a cut encoded scalar retains a canonical prefix and an explicit
`textTruncated` flag without inventing an omitted-character count. Compact
mode does not assemble `effectiveToolPolicy`. Title, goal, evidence, progress,
pause, and wait text are independently bounded with explicit loss flags; the
final result is capped at 64 KiB. It fails rather than silently dropping a goal
outcome or blocker at the final boundary.

`detail: "full"` returns the previous bounded configuration projection,
including `initialMessage`, instructions, metadata previews, resources, selected
tools, `effectiveToolPolicy`, Variable Set ids, and projection byte/loss facts.
It is configuration inspection, not the compact goal/progress response with
extra fields. Variable values are never returned.

A goal's `completed` status is not a terminal child result. Join with
`session_wait` and `waitFor: "completion"` using the last **consumed event cursor**
(0 when none has been consumed). Do not advance that cursor to a fresh
`session_get.lastSequence`: this snapshot watermark can already include an
unread completion, and the wait reads strictly after its cursor. For an
already-settled child, retrieve its result-bearing completion with
`session_events` with `view: "results"` or join from the last consumed cursor.
The results projection omits maintenance/segment settlements. Use the default
conversation view for completed progress messages and explicit diagnostic views
for exact retained execution evidence. `waitFor: "change"` wakes on settled
facts, not on each streamed assistant message: a completion that carries a
provider `messageId` or a `phase` is excluded in SQL, so a long run of progress
notes can neither wake the waiter nor fill its page ahead of the outcome, and
the turn's `turn.completed` carries the answer. A `latest: "terminal"` lookup
likewise skips commentary.
Do not use `session_get` on your own current session to reconstruct conversation
context.

## Authority and implementation

Both detail modes use the same permission checks, live attempt validation,
tenancy/private-session filtering, Slack-private scope, and optional host
narrowing. Authorization runs before list filtering, ranking, totals, cursors,
and evidence reads. A target-only grant can see a generic ancestor blocker, but
not that ancestor's id, title, actor, or pause reason. Queue control must be
projected before either detail serializer and never reapplied raw afterward.
Policy provenance follows the same boundary: target-only reads null a non-target
`inheritedFromSessionId` in both `toolPolicy` and `effectiveToolPolicy`, so later
effective-policy assembly cannot restore the hidden identity. Policy mode, tool
sets, counts, and root-authorized lineage remain unchanged.

Canonical compact row, detail, pause, text and evidence-selection helpers live
in `packages/contracts/src/session-mcp-projections.ts`. The API's
`mcp/session-view.ts` and `mcp/server.ts` enforce final MCP byte envelopes and
preserve the legacy full serializers. `getSessionMcpMonitoringSummary` and
`listSessionDiscoverySummaries` in `packages/db/src/index.ts` own the bounded
storage reads. These helpers are presentation boundaries, never authorization.
