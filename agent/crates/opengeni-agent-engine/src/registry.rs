//! Op lifecycle: idempotent begin, cancel tombstones, bounded completed-op
//! retention with LOUD eviction.
//!
//! The registry is the runner-side authority for "does this op exist and in
//! what phase" (PROTOCOL.md rulings B1/M5/M6):
//!
//! * **Idempotent begin** — beginning a known op NEVER re-runs it; the caller
//!   gets the current phase and attaches instead (this is what kills the
//!   at-least-once double-execution hazard, and it is also the recovery path
//!   for a re-dispatched turn re-issuing the same durable op id).
//! * **Cancel tombstones** — a cancel for an op that has not begun yet is
//!   recorded; a later begin refuses to spawn (born-cancelled). Without this,
//!   message reordering turns cancellation into advice.
//! * **Bounded retention, loud eviction** — completed ops are retained until
//!   the consumer's final ack, a TTL, or an LRU cap. Evicting an op whose
//!   result was never final-acked is a counted, queryable event
//!   (`lost{evicted}`) — a dropped result must never be silent.
//!
//! The registry is generic over the per-op runtime state `T` (retention log,
//! credit flow, child handle …) so lifecycle rules are testable with `T = ()`
//! and there is exactly ONE map — no shadow bookkeeping to diverge from.
//! All time is caller-injected `now_ms`; the registry never reads a clock.
