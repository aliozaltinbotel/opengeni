/**
 * Subscription authority and session access are separate permissions.

 * - Subscription authority decides which account pool a run may use. Shared
 *   (organization or workspace) pools are read and written under a synthetic
 *   pool-worker database subject, because no human owns those pool rows.
 * - Session access decides which session rows a database operation may see.
 *   FORCE RLS admits a `user_private` session only when the subject or the
 *   `opengeni.initiating_human_subject_id` setting is the session owner.
 *
 * Switching to a pool-worker subject must therefore never change who can see
 * the session the run belongs to. Two rules keep it that way:
 *
 * - Waiter writes for shared pools (arm and reconcile, in
 *   `withScopedCapacityWaiterRls`, and the wake below) run with no subject,
 *   as Codex waiters do; their pool policies do not read the subject.
 * - Operations that must act as the pool-worker subject (the waiter lookup,
 *   lease acquisition, session pins, last-account metadata and the
 *   in-transaction waiter peek) re-establish the exact turn's frozen
 *   initiating human (`session_turns.initiating_human_subject_id`) alongside
 *   it. That admits only sessions owned by that human, which is exactly the
 *   access the accepted turn already carried, so the pool worker gains no
 *   general visibility of private sessions.

/**
 * Run a subscription operation that uses a pool-worker subject without losing

 *
 * - Non-pool subjects (a human acting on their own private pool, or an API
 *   caller) already carry their own access and run unchanged.
 * - Any ambient session actor owns its context and `fn` runs unchanged,
 *   whatever its subject and whether or not it carries an initiating human
 *   (for example the agent-turn actor of a service turn whose initiating
 *   human is null). The restored human is never combined with a different
 *   subject, so an ambient actor can never gain another member's private
 *   session visibility through this helper.
 * - Otherwise (no ambient actor, for example the capacity workflow's waiter
 *   lookup) the exact turn's frozen initiating human is re-established
 *   together with the pool-worker subject for the duration of `fn`, so
 *   private and shared sessions behave identically. Pass the acting `turnId`;
 *   without it the session's active turn is used. A turn with no initiating
 *   human, or one that is not a turn of `sessionId`, restores nothing and
 *   private sessions stay hidden (fail closed).
 *
 * The restored actor applies to every scope `fn` opens. Wrapped functions are
 * single transactions already scoped to the pool-worker subject, so it only
 * affects that transaction.
 *
 * Call it with a pool handle. When restoration would be needed it refuses an
 * open transaction handle: such a transaction is already scoped to some
 * subject and initiating human, which would decide which turn the lookup can
 * see, and the restored actor would then apply inside a transaction whose
 * scope the caller chose.
