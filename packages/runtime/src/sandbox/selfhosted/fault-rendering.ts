// The in-band fault renderer for Connected Machine (selfhosted) control faults.
//
// The failure-visibility doctrine: every fault the model sees at the point of
// impact must carry FOUR fields — what happened, which layer, what was preserved,
// what to try — with a retry verdict that is actually correct for the fault class.
//
// Why this exists: a thrown `SelfhostedControlError` reaches the model already
// wrapped by the SDK's generic tool-error function as
// "An error occurred while running the tool. Please try again. Error: …". That
// "Please try again" is actively wrong for a machine that is offline, a consent
// that has not been granted, or a reply that was too large — the model retries a
// fault that a retry cannot fix, and must parse prose to recover which layer
// failed. The typed `SelfhostedControlError` flags carry the truth; this renders
// them into the four structural fields so the capability tools can surface a
// legible fault as their result instead of the misleading wrapper.

 *    fix is to bound the output, not to retry.
 *  - DRAINING → pre-admission backpressure; nothing ran; safe to retry shortly.

 *  - AGENT_OFFLINE → the machine link is down. If the transport KNOWS the request
 *    never left (`neverSent`), nothing ran; otherwise the effect is ambiguous and
 *    the model must check before re-running. Either way "try again" is wrong until
 *    the machine reconnects.
 *  - agent_reconnecting (TIMEOUT) → a transient link blip AFTER send: ambiguous, so
 *    a state-changing command must be checked before re-running (at-least-once).
 *  - NOT_FOUND → a command/filesystem miss, not a link fault.
 *  - FENCED → the active machine session changed (a swap); re-run.
