/**
 * Per-channel and per-DM Slack workspace routing.
 *
 * Routing is decided BEFORE any agent runs, from durable facts only, so it can
 * never be a model judgement. The resolver is pure with respect to the database
 * reads it is handed: it returns a decision, and the caller persists and acts on
 * it.
 *
 * Two rules are load-bearing and easy to break by accident:
 *
 *   A mapped thread keeps the workspace it was created in, unconditionally,
 *   including after the channel has been re-pointed. Otherwise a live
 *   conversation would silently change tenants mid-thread.
 *
 *   A subject who lacks access to the routed workspace is NEVER quietly served
 *   from another workspace they happen to belong to. Every failure is explicit
 *   and creates no session.
