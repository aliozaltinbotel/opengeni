# @opengeni/runtime

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 056997b: Make `skill_checkout` fast. The worker now writes a Skill's files through one Channel-A `fsWriteFiles` batch, normally a single sandbox command with one workspace mutation admission and one `fs.changed` event, instead of about five sandbox commands per file. On a real Docker sandbox an 11-file, 31 KB Skill went from 61 sandbox commands, 35 mutation admissions, and 13 events (about 4 s) to 1 command, 1 admission, and 1 event (about 0.1 to 0.2 s). Checkout never overwrites: files already holding the same bytes are kept and reported `unchanged`, and any different existing entry fails before anything is written, so repeating a checkout into the same directory is safe. New optional `paths` copies exactly those files, for example one script to run. Only a complete checkout that created its directory returns the `skill_publish` base; other results say `publishable: false`. The default `skill_read` also returns a bounded `scripts` index (path and first usage line) so commands are visible without a checkout. The worker records `opengeni_skill_checkouts_total`, `opengeni_skill_checkout_duration_seconds{phase}`, and `opengeni_skill_checkout_files_total`. `@opengeni/runtime` exports `SandboxChannelAService.fsWriteFiles`, `FsWriteFilesRequest`, `FsWriteFilesResponse`, and `skillScriptIndex`.
- a1b6b8e: An automatically attached (optional) repository that loses access after a task started no longer fails the task's later turns. Before the strict per-turn GitHub App allowlist recheck and installation-token mint, the worker drops, for that turn only, each optional repository the workspace allowlist no longer admits or the GitHub App installation can no longer reach, and reports it as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on a `sandbox.operation.completed` event named `optional-repository-access`. It only ever removes repositories; explicitly attached repositories keep the strict behavior.

  Optional repository clones are also bounded (60 seconds each, 90 seconds together) when the sandbox has a `timeout` binary, so a hung fetch is skipped with the usual warning instead of failing sandbox setup. Explicit clones are unchanged.

  `@opengeni/github` adds `findInaccessibleGitHubAppInstallationRepositories`. `@opengeni/runtime` exports `OPTIONAL_REPOSITORY_CLONE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and `repositoryCloneCommand` and `runRepositoryCloneHook` accept an optional per-repository timeout.

  `@opengeni/react` keeps the `optional-repository-access` report out of the transcript, like the routine repository-clone event.

- a82657f: Register signed credential providers and webhooks once per organization with explicit external-source filters and workspace overrides, excluding Personal workspaces. Include authorized initiating-human identity, registration lane, workspace routing and selected remote targets. Bind renewable MCP headers to normalized URLs only, restrict transport headers, skip unavailable targets and fail closed on expiry. Add immediate signing-secret rotation and canonical browser/organization-key administration. Server-only organization helpers, individual webhook reads, and secret rotation are opt-in functions from `@opengeni/sdk/workspace-integrations`, taking `client` first rather than expanding the eager browser client.
- 514f8ea: Count Skill reads and record a content-free Skill-use fact on each model `skill_read` event. The worker increments `opengeni_skill_reads_total{source, skill, kind, caller}`, where `skill` is a built-in id or `custom`, so tenant Skill ids, names, and requested identifiers never become labels. A successful model read also carries `_meta["opengeni/skillUse"]` (resolved id and source, ledger revision or whole-artifact digest, result kind, returned bytes, whether the Skill was in this turn's model-visible index, and whether `skill_search` returned it earlier in the attempt). MCP `_meta` never reaches the model, so the model-visible result and model history stay byte-identical; only the `agent.toolCall.output` event projection keeps the fact. Codemode results never carry it, and it is dropped rather than let a result cross the 1 MiB model-visible cap. `@opengeni/contracts` exports `SkillUse`, `SkillUseSource`, `SkillReadKind`, `SKILL_USE_META_KEY`, and `skillUseFromToolOutput` (the writer schema is closed; the reader drops fields a newer writer adds instead of the whole fact); `@opengeni/runtime` exports `skillCatalogEntryIds` and `modelToolResultFits`.
- 14990d0: A task started from Slack now starts from what the workspace offers every new session instead of the person's last website composer selection. Connectors follow the workspace default connector policy (including the person's own personal connections when that policy includes connected servers, still executable only through the frozen delegation snapshot), OpenGeni tools follow the workspace default selection, and the Sandbox Environment and its Variable Sets follow the workspace default. Only an explicitly chosen model carries over. Mentions, commands, DMs and shortcuts now always add the read-only Slack context tools, including when the workspace has its own default OpenGeni tool selection; reactions still do not.

  Repositories are the person's own recently used repositories in that workspace: those on the top-level sessions they started there in the last 30 days, most recent first, at most five, and only through their current entry in the workspace GitHub App catalog (same catalog and `github:use` permission as the website picker), on the default branch. Archived and empty repositories are skipped. A person with no recent repositories gets none; GitHub is asked only when there is something to look up, and an outage starts the task without repositories. These repositories are attached best effort.

  Repository resources gain an optional `optional: true` flag (contracts and SDK). A failed clone of such a repository logs a warning, is reported as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone` operation event, and no longer fails sandbox setup; a repository without the flag keeps the strict behavior. `GitHubRepository` gains optional `archived` and `sizeKb`, filled from GitHub when reported.

  The Slack acknowledgement adds one line naming what the task started with, for example `Using connectors: Gmail, Linear; repos: opengeni.` It names only connectors the first accepted turn can reach, so a personal-only connector the person never connected is not claimed. The line is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0529 adds the nullable `slack_interactions.session_defaults_line`), so a repaired acknowledgement re-renders identical bytes. A Slack message or a reacted-to message that links a workspace or session on a different deployment under the same parent domain (for example staging versus production) now carries a model-context note, so the agent says the link is for the other deployment instead of reporting the session as not found.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/core` removes `getActorNewSessionDefaults`. Use `getActorNewSessionModelChoice`, which returns only an explicitly chosen model policy. `@opengeni/db` adds `SlackInteraction.sessionDefaultsLine`, an optional `sessionDefaultsLine` input to `bindSlackInteractionSession` (written only by the bind that wins), `listRecentSessionRepositoryResources`, and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`.

- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 3dc46a8: When a step needs a Variable Set the current session does not have, agents run that step in a child session created with it instead of asking the user to attach it.
- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- aad6598: Claude subscription setup and replacement require only the setup token. Observe
  provider usage and reset windows from ordinary model responses, including quota
  errors, and expose scoped cached reads and authorized refreshes. Preserve the last
  reading when inference-only tokens cannot use the separate usage endpoint; fence
  cached readings against credential replacement and revocation.
- 6146167: `code_search` never searches or returns platform credential material. `.opengeni/` (Codemode tokens, Git credential files and bindings), `.azure/` (the Azure CLI login cache) and `.config/opengeni/` (Connected Machine enrollment credentials) are excluded at any depth from every ripgrep call, and an explicit path into one of them, in any spelling or through a symlink, is ignored.
- 8d2bcdf: Keep agents in the current execution attempt while awaiting Codemode calls, and explain how to inspect retained receipts after an attempt expires without replaying mutations.
- a5e93ba: Background commands that finish quickly but print a lot of output are now recognized as finished on the next background check instead of staying "running" for hours. Their sandbox can then save its workspace and go idle normally, instead of being held until the provider's 24-hour limit ends it. A command's saved output keeps its first 16 MiB and its final part, with a note where output was skipped.
- cb25b14: Agents skip the opening progress update only when they expect to answer within about 20 seconds, down from about a minute, so a request that takes longer shows its first message sooner.
- d480872: Agent links to OpenGeni objects now work inside an embedding product. `artifact:` files download by default from `SessionConversation`; sandbox-path downloads require explicit proxy `sandboxFiles: true` and use bounded, no-symlink reads within the session working directory. Editable artifacts and Sites route through a new `resolveLink` prop (`MessageTimeline`, `SessionConversation`, `Markdown`, `OpenGeniLinkProvider`) instead of rendering console paths that 404 on the host origin. Invalid reserved references render unavailable. `parseOpenGeniLink` in `@opengeni/sdk` classifies the same hrefs for non-React clients and preserves validated console return hints. Editable-artifact export uses configured exporter capabilities and preflights the exact format and options before creating a snapshot or pinning a version. Stock deployments serve spreadsheet XLSX; the artifact Skills stop promising unsupported PDF/DOCX/PPTX exports.
- a6644b6: Bundled integration guidance now defaults to embedding the full React
  `SessionConversation` behind the packaged SDK session proxy, lists headless
  hooks, SDK-only, the workbench, and the text-only chat facade as deliberate
  deviations, and no longer suggests linking to stock OpenGeni as an embed.
- a6644b6: Bundled integration guidance adds build gotchas (always pass `baseUrl`,
  per-session MCP servers must also be selected in `tools` and be publicly
  reachable, `sandboxBackend: "none"` for pure chat/tool agents, pause vs
  cancel for Stop, scheduled tasks for background agents), a single bundled
  question for the user-owned choices, and the per-user workspace option.
- 6f28afd: A definitively lost managed Modal sandbox no longer dead-ends its sessions. Shared sandbox groups (a parent with its children) now get the automatic checkpoint fallback, and every member receives the durable filesystem-discontinuity warning. When no checkpoint can be restored automatically (no archive, an unverified or legacy archive, an invalid artifact, or a definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure of the selected checkpoint), the whole quiescent group continues on a new empty workspace after a separate audited decision that warns every member the previous files are not available. Loss must be proven by a loss transition (a failed replacement box never counts), the empty workspace waits until the lost box is past its hard provider lifetime, other restore failures (including a missing archive object, now `archive_object_missing`, or unconfigured archive storage, now `archive_storage_unavailable`) retry the checkpoint with backoff and then wait for an operator, and a complete archive is never bypassed. Ambiguous provider states and live writers in any member still block, unknown command outcomes are never replayed, and the lost archive evidence is kept. Sessions stuck before this release recover on their next turn or Retry. The recovery projection adds `automaticLane` (`checkpoint` or `fresh_workspace`) and, for a timed wait, `availableAt` (when a Retry or a new message can decide again), and the failed-session banner says what Retry will do and when. Rolling migration 0548 requires warning protocol v3 to claim a session with an empty-workspace receipt.
- 32598eb: Expose content-free MCP phase timings and host-owned outbound trace correlation across gateway, credential, transport and persistence boundaries. Preserve W3C sampling flags, credential header semantics, exact execution authority and existing retry behavior.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- f68b176: Preserve workspace model access restrictions when renewing or reconnecting Claude, Anthropic, OpenRouter and Gateway credentials. Bound Claude HTTP error-body reads so stalled diagnostics cannot hide rate-limit/retry information. Associate Claude account-import help and validation errors with its accessible control.
- 126a395: Make agent effort proportional to the request. The operational contract now asks for a direct answer with minimal tool use on simple asks, reuse of the earlier approach on repeat asks, one-sentence progress updates without a forced opening update, answer-first final responses, answers from web or published sources that are short but not partial (the best-supported finding, figures in the user's terms, and a source link beside each study or figure), and reading each Skill once without announcing it. A question asked mid-run gets an answer instead of restarting work; while work is still in flight the agent answers in one or two sentences in the user's terms, naming a blocker only when the user must act on it, and registers the wait again with the earlier reason and remaining time, even with an active goal, so its result still resumes the agent without pushing back a timed recheck, and a question alone no longer resumes a paused goal. Answers stay in chat by default; a document Artifact is created only when the user asks for one or the deliverable is large or meant to be kept or shared, and a session no longer creates a goal only to declare a document. The default persona is a general assistant; it works on a branch with a pull request only when the repository has a remote and git provider credentials, and otherwise leaves changes in the working tree without branch or pull request talk unless the user asks, saying only that the changes are not pushed when the repository has a remote, and the Sites and visualize Skill descriptors apply when the user asks or clearly benefits.
- 359382e: Add attached-browser-only discovery so finding a personal Chrome profile does not load unrelated workspace sessions and saved identities. Expose discovery scope and bridge metadata in the Codemode facade.
- 7a08660: Make a finished child's result carry its answer. An idle `child_terminal_result` now includes optional `payload.finalAnswer`: the child's newest result-bearing answer, frozen by the idle settlement, bounded to 8 KiB UTF-8 with a head/tail truncation marker and a `session_events` pointer to the full text (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswer`, `CHILD_TERMINAL_RESULT_FINAL_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES`). No answer is copied when the child's newest turn failed, was cancelled or superseded, or stopped at a segment limit. A turn claimed only to continue the child's goal (for example one that confirms and completes the goal after the answer) no longer replaces the answer: the answer is reported with that turn's output after it as `finalAnswer.goalContinuations`, whole when the parts fit the bound (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswerWithGoalContinuations`). Parts that do not fit are reported as the newest part, marked truncated, with `omittedSequences` and a `nextAction` that reads every part, so a child working across goal continuations still reports its final report. The walk stops at a non-answer outcome and at the child's newest goal activation, and a window holding only continuations reports the newest answer alone. The worker's enrichment upsert now keeps the committed answer and evidence instead of replacing them, and an untruncated answer serves as the parent claim's consumption evidence. When a parent's exact live attempt reads a direct child's complete answer through `session_wait` or `session_events` in its own model call (the worker now marks first-party calls with `_meta.opengeniCaller`, `FIRST_PARTY_MCP_CALLER_META_KEY`; Codemode calls do not count), the answer is recorded on the reading turn (`metadata.consumedChildAnswers`, `recordConsumedChildAnswers`) and `session_wait` stops counting that child's result as own pending input (`listOutstandingSessionSystemUpdatesForAttempt`). The attempt's successful completion settlement supersedes each still-pending idle result whose every part it received (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and a result the child commits after that completion is inserted already consumed, without a wake. A read by an attempt that fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing. The operational contract and the `session_create`, `session_wait`, `session_get`, `session_send_message`, and `wait_for_input` descriptions now price a child, prefer a direct answer or reusing an existing child, and steer multi-minute waits to `wait_for_input` instead of alternating `session_wait` and `session_get`. No tool is capped or removed.
- b28d5fa: Reading a session's stored bundled Skill selection now drops ids this build does not know instead of failing the whole session read. Dropping only narrows the stored selection; API input still rejects unknown ids, and keyed create replay still compares the exact stored selection. The bundled `document-parsing` guide now ships the upstream AnyDoc MIT license and a `SOURCES.md` attribution, the runtime package notices cover both AnyDoc-derived guidance copies, and the `skill_install` description no longer claims that `skill_search` returns library ids.
- bcd9988: Give the model the current time without a tool call, and ask supported models for shorter answers. Each claimed user message now carries a separate `[Message sent <weekday> <date> <HH:MM> UTC]` part taken from the turn's durable acceptance time, and each delivered machine-input batch states its `deliveredAt` and every member's `createdAt` (scheduled occurrences add `Delivered:` and `Created:` lines). The times are persisted with the history row, never computed at inference time, and never enter `Agent.instructions`. Agent turns on the Codex subscription, direct OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses routes send `text.verbosity: "low"` for GPT-5-family and later models; the new optional `textVerbosity` agent option is omitted everywhere else, so Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, chat and other compatible routes are unchanged. `reasoning.summary` is unchanged. Realtime voice-call history now keeps a user message's separate parts on separate lines.
- b5a77df: Make rejected tool arguments actionable. When a call does not match the tool's advertised input schema, the gateway error now names each missing, mistyped, or unexpected property (for example `missing required property "context"`), reports up to eight problems plus a count of the rest, and never quotes argument values. `ToolGatewayInputValidationError` gains `issues`, `omittedIssueCount`, and `summary`. The accept/reject decision still stops at the first error; the all-errors pass runs only after a rejection, only for arguments up to 64 KiB serialized, and never runs a `pattern` on a string longer than that subschema's `maxLength`.

  A model MCP call rejected this way now reads "The tool was not called because its arguments do not match the tool's input schema: ... Correct the named properties and call the tool again." instead of "Please try again", so the model fixes the arguments rather than resending the same call. Other thrown MCP failures keep the existing wording. The workspace tool HTTP call and approval routes return the same summary on their `422` (`code: "validation_failed"`, `details.code: "invalid_tool_arguments"` with `issues` and `omittedIssueCount`); the previous body carried only the bare code as its message.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 585f2c1: Add an operator-disabled ephemeral Chromium BrowserSession mode for disposable sandbox verification. Explicit requests use isolated browser contexts within a trusted actor and placement partition, preserve existing private-profile defaults, and become terminal after shared process loss instead of silently recreating or replaying work.

### Patch Changes

- 74e0dfb: Refresh the default Modal desktop image to the verified publication supporting
  viewport actions and focused DOM reads. Report exact legacy controller schema
  and route mismatches as unsupported controller features without replaying browser
  actions or restarting live sessions.
- 1fa1216: Bind browser viewer input to the frame actually painted, cancel stale queued input
  across navigation and target changes, and preserve ordered scroll input. Treat
  plain upstream gateway failures as transport errors without blindly replaying
  browser mutations.
- d83d5d0: Distinguish Connected Machine self-update drains and admission breakers in errors instead of labeling every refusal as capacity exhaustion. Preserve typed reasons through retry exhaustion without changing retry or execution behavior.
- 9d0c1bb: Clarify that closing a tab does not release its browser process. Guide agents to
  end their completed disposable browser sessions or suspend supported sessions
  that need continuation, while preserving shared and user-owned browsers.
- ec707de: Negotiate bounded viewer typing batches from the active browser controller. Preserve
  individual text events and input order while reducing request overhead; recheck the
  original document fence before each action and discard uncertain queued input
  without replay. Older controllers retain sequential input.
- 82fa577: Use supported transactional file transfers for small in-place editor updates and file creation, avoiding interruption-prone direct replacement writes. Preserve legacy-agent and small-move compatibility.
- 3aab8f9: Allow a single MCP provider to use the existing aggregate tool-count allowance instead of dropping otherwise bounded catalogs above 1,000 tools. Align permissions discovery and explicit tool selections with the same allowance. Preserve definition, response, per-provider and aggregate byte limits and shared count accounting.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.

### Patch Changes

- f3d178b: A model tool call to `knowledge_search` (first-party and Docs MCP) or `knowledge_prepare_save` now receives a compact copy of the result: the same JSON without timestamps, rank score, revision lineage, session and review-batch IDs, default-valued flags, a collection descriptor's `revisionId`, or a `revision.preview` that is empty or already begins a content excerpt starting at offset 0. Every entry and collection ID, `version`, `revision.id`, scope, publication status, title, kind, group and parent ID, description, excerpt, index status and cursor is kept, and a preview with unique text is kept in full. Codemode scripts and every other programmatic caller still receive the exact result. The projection runs at the existing per-caller seam (`projectAttemptToolResultForCaller`, which gains an optional tool identity), after the MCP transport has bounded the exact result; a result still over 1 MiB for the model spills its exact bytes. It affects only new tool outputs and passes any result that does not strictly match the contract through unchanged. On fixtures sized to staging medians a search result shrinks by 44% and a save preparation by 35%.
- 9cdeef1: Git credential provisioning scripts (the repository clone setup and both token refresh commands) now refuse to run unless the sandbox lifecycle hook marks the command as targeting a sandbox. Executed directly on a developer or host machine they exit with status 78 before touching `$HOME/.opengeni` or the global Git configuration, instead of replacing that user's credential helpers. The runtime's clone and renewal hooks add the marker, so sandbox behavior is unchanged.
- 48a8774: Generate automatic session titles on chat-completions providers, such as OpenRouter connections, through one direct request outside the agent runner instead of a runner-only traced call that always failed. Routes without a resolved provider client now take the same direct path. The title request uses the model's lowest runnable reasoning effort and a larger output budget, a response stopped by the output limit keeps only whole words, and inline `<think>` reasoning before the answer is dropped. Automatic titles no longer keep a dangling closing quote or markdown mark from a wrapped title such as `"Pod Crash Debugging"` or `**Pod Crash Debugging**`. The managed OpenRouter free route (`isManagedOpenRouterFreeRoute`: the deployment-funded OpenRouter provider serving a `:free` variant) sends no title request, because it would spend the deployment key's shared per-minute and per-day request limits that users' turns need; those sessions keep the prompt preview until a turn on another route titles them.
- fa12bd4: Keep detached NATS subscription loops from rejecting the process: a poison message or throwing consumer is dropped and logged, and a subscription error such as a permissions violation ends only that subscription instead of reaching the API's fatal unhandled-rejection boundary. A session or workspace-control SSE stream whose live subscription ends fails retryably so the client replays from Postgres, and the auth-callout, Codemode request, and agent-event responders resubscribe with bounded backoff; every unexpected end is counted in `opengeni_nats_subscription_terminations_total` and alerts. Long-lived NATS connections keep reconnecting through repeated auth errors. A freshly created sandbox that misses its command-readiness budget is terminated and replaced at most once per turn attempt after a jittered pause, with outcomes in `opengeni_sandbox_readiness_replacements_total`, and Codex/xAI capacity-wait wakes are spread by a bounded replay-safe jitter so a capacity reset no longer resumes every waiting turn at once.
- 36e1764: An exhausted model-provider quota no longer retries. A daily or monthly allowance (for example OpenRouter's `free-models-per-day` cap or a requests/tokens-per-day limit), a used-up quota (`insufficient_quota`), an account out of credits (HTTP 402), or a 429 whose provider retry hint exceeds 15 minutes now fails the turn at once with the new `provider_quota_exhausted` code, `retryable: false`, a `quotaScope`, plain-language copy, and the provider's text as `detail`, instead of five paced same-turn recoveries. Ordinary per-minute rate limits, and quota wording whose provider retry hint is a minute or less, remain `provider_rate_limited` and retryable. `@opengeni/runtime` exports the classifier (`classifyProviderQuotaError`), and model clients that let the OpenAI SDK retry classify the exact SDK error for a 429 and mark an exhausted one `x-should-retry: false`, so the SDK does not replay it either and both decisions always agree. Google's generic `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status and snake_case per-minute metric ids (Vertex `requests_per_minute_per_project`) stay retryable. A quota-refused compaction request records the same `quotaScope` marker, and failed session detail projects it. Codex and SuperGrok subscription transports keep their credential-rotation and capacity-wait semantics.
- c1756ef: Make operational signals truthful: the session recovery backlog no longer counts effectively paused sessions as stale, a read-only first sandbox probe that finds no path is recorded as a completed startup phase, Knowledge index deferrals log a content-free cause, and repeated warnings can be throttled per key with a suppressed count.

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- c41aecd: Fix attached-browser event pagination and dedicated-tab creation, isolate concurrent macOS native capture helpers, separate still screenshots from live-stream reads, and serialize exact frame bytes. Preserve bounded controller diagnostics, read legacy browser capabilities conservatively, and respect explicit placement and identity when reusing interaction resources. Install matching agent and controller builds together; native capture uses protocol version 3.

  Clean up partially allocated virtual desktops when a required executable is missing instead of letting an unhandled spawn error terminate the controller.

- e65a4ac: Document the Connected Machine native client's offline document-ID helper for
  artifact authoring when the JavaScript client is unavailable. This workflow
  requires an agent binary with the `codemode document-id` command; existing
  artifact authorization and inspected-head edit requirements are unchanged.
- 22b2dd5: Recover Modal command-router DNS failures when the provider omits the default port.

### Patch Changes

- 701ea95: Preserve the original shell command when adopting background processes, so running command rows and completion notices show the command instead of execCommand. Keep long command rows ellipsized and expose their saved preview on hover and expansion.
- e9c4379: Resolve published-file Markdown links through host navigation, expose message presentation in SessionConversation, and document exact retained-file link/embed syntax.
- d92af11: Keep original command text through ambiguous launch recovery and persist it separately from bounded previews. Preserve whitespace, mark clipped previews with an ellipsis, and show complete commands on expansion and hover.
- f60ca2b: Raise Skill folder limits eightfold to 1,024 files, 2 MiB per file, and 8 MiB total, while retaining bounded reads and existing validation.
- 86c710a: Expose a first-party Connected Machine enrollment-token tool with existing enrollment-management authority, short-lived tokens and deployment-bound installer commands. Include agent guidance without introducing an additional approval flow.
- 2f8bc58: Use bounded readable MCP tool aliases while preserving exact account routing and historical approval rehydration. Retain action and account display metadata in native and Codemode timeline events and approval cards without changing execution or approval identity. Legacy opaque calls resolve only against the current authorized tool catalog.
- a184108: Teach agents that a Site reaches OpenGeni models and tools through the host bridge and never needs its own server. Ask about external commitments or material architecture changes beyond the authorized scope while preserving established and delegated choices.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

### Minor Changes

- 6d0a4de: Include opengeni-client in the default Skill catalog in local, self-hosted and
  managed deployments. The repository guide is the sole authored source; generated
  runtime assets include every reference and require no Pack, installation, network
  fetch or sandbox to read. Explicit bundledSkillIds selections still narrow it.

  Improve adaptive resource discovery, UI selection, runtime behavior, tool data
  semantics, and outcome-based verification without prescribing a fixed product
  architecture or answer format.

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.

### Patch Changes

- a6d3e4a: Route persistent behavior to scoped workspace instructions or applicable Skills
  instead of retrieval-only Knowledge. Make the routing and safe instruction-edit
  guidance unconditional, reinforce it in save tools and Skill guidance, and retain
  the existing scope and Agent learning controls.
- c31a951: Add connection-bound MCP tool permission discovery and Allow/Ask/Block management through the existing approval ledger, enforced consistently for direct tools and Codemode.

  Let workspace-default sessions inherit newly connected apps while retaining per-session connector exclusions and exact explicit selections. Present connected apps, logos, health, and reconnection in the composer connector menu. Keep internal runtime controls out of workspace settings and use Capabilities consistently in settings navigation.

- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- d1ab270: Persist configured skill catalogs as versioned conversation context, preserving prior prompt history across catalog updates, retries, compaction, and forks.
- c3f1705: Handle an explicitly disabled MCP approval policy when rebuilding connection-backed agents. Preserve connector authorization and action-policy checks while avoiding a startup TypeError after approval settings change.
- 9de8e51: Route missing integration setup through provider-neutral catalog discovery and the shared human authorization card, with an explicit next action for every eligible catalog integration. Continue account selection and installation through owner authorization without an extra launch click, and open repository configuration in a separate tab.
- a74ea02: Await release-matched client preparation before publishing a supported mid-turn
  managed home replacement, fenced against its exact lease and provider. Join
  concurrent home resolutions, preserve the prior route on preparation failure,
  and leave unchanged identities and Connected Machine clients untouched.
- 9a7931c: Observe the fixed Modal materialization visibility probe through its own
  cancelable provider cursor instead of borrowing the parent mutation's retained
  command handle. Preserve actual failures and unconfirmed deadline evidence
  without retrying materialization or agent work.
- 3fa175e: Provide bundled OpenGeni product help with official documentation links,
  integration and billing boundaries, and dependency recovery guidance. Hosts can
  exclude it with the existing bundledSkillIds selection, including an empty list
  for embedded agents. Update the canonical integration guide.
- 332a02d: Accept an explicit null skill-review reference for ordinary structured human-input questions while retaining strict validation of real review references and their host-owned confirmation presentation.
- 9d9b94b: Keep the published dependency closure aligned with the updated plugin removal
  contracts. The SDK exposes named removal outcomes and optional preview-token
  confirmation alongside the existing installation-version check.
- 0a41330: Reuse the fully prepared model request for remote compaction, including sandbox instructions, filtered tools, and model settings. Prepare operator and pre-turn compaction through the same model boundary without sending ordinary inference. Capture compaction requests in model diagnostics.
- e261b39: Retain background command outcomes without starting a new agent turn unless the session is explicitly waiting for input. Let compatible command notices accompany later input without blocking messages behind a command backlog. Coalesce different originating turns only when their resolved human and complete inherited execution authority match, retaining original lineage and existing batch limits.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- ac006ef: Add opt-in durable GPT-6 Astra reasoning effort updates with a stable request-level baseline, retry fencing, SDK replay, and explicit compaction restoration. Disabled by default pending live backend verification.
- d3672c0: Measure workspace capture gate waits on every routed sandbox operation, including
  mid-turn and API-direct operations, without changing provider-call accounting or
  admission guarantees. Record physical warm capture and publication duration at
  actual settlement, including captures that outlive the initiating caller.
- d84b1a3: Preserve sandbox visibility-check command evidence in durable turn failures and
  expose bounded, explained failure categories on the Runtime Failures dashboard.
- 7e2436a: Keep ordinary chat attachments out of Knowledge unless selected as useful evidence or a reusable reference. Distinguish supporting evidence from discoverable references, preserve exact originals and revisions, and add read-only collection and duplicate discovery before saving. Includes maintenance migration 0469; old runtimes must be drained before activation.
- bfc92c2: Preserve reasoning configuration during remote compaction, retain turn-scoped operational notices in conversation history, and keep attachment receipt text stable across metadata refreshes.
- bd6319b: Detach standalone compaction from the completed SDK Runner trace without changing its provider-visible request prefix.
- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.
- a74ea02: Deliver verified release-matched CLI and ESM Codemode clients during managed
  sandbox setup, including warm boxes with older baked clients. Select immutable
  content-addressed client paths per command without changing sandbox manifests,
  catalog integrity, authorization, or the public operation journal.

### Patch Changes

- 7746251: Prevent agent-authored workspace instruction changes from replacing the complete active policy, fence unsafe older pending revisions at approval, and show reviewers the current and proposed instruction text before approval.
- 85cafd0: Add a shared workspace/session artifact catalog over existing Sites, editable artifacts, generated images, and published files. Keep file bytes and content authorization in their existing domains, expose bounded filtered discovery through the SDK, and retain explicit sandbox-file publication provenance. The web Artifacts library includes type/search/sort controls, grid/list views, retained image previews, and file viewers that do not wake compute. Published images use the shared chat image/lightbox presentation; ordinary HTML file downloads remain non-executable.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Patch Changes

- 750060c: Support inline HTML visualizations, retained images, and embedded Sites in chat. Add a plain HTML Site client, preserve application request headers through the shared bridge, document visualization workflows, and use Image 2.5 Sunburst for Codex image generation.
- 123cf57: Make agent-authored workspace instruction changes non-destructive: append new rules by default, require one exact anchor for edits or removals, and reserve complete replacement for an explicit mode while preserving baseline conflict checks and instruction budgets.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e41027c: Add opt-in MCP operation outcome recovery through a configured read-only provider receipt tool. Persist exact operation identity before dispatch, retain original invocation outcomes separately from late receipts, and revalidate current authority across accepted attempts without replaying mutations. Preserve arbitrary SDK call IDs as correlation rather than replacing UUID operation identity.

  Apply the additive operation-ledger migration and runtime-role provisioning, and upgrade all claim-capable workers to the membership-first lock order before enabling provider mappings. Providers must implement the documented observation contract; unsupported providers and historical operations without captured authority are not automatically recoverable.

- d08dbb6: Support capability-gated transactional large-file edits on Connected Machines,
  with bounded transfers, verified outcomes, and live authorization checks. Keep
  legacy agent writes compatible and report oversized outbound requests accurately
  instead of marking a healthy agent offline. Native agent support is required;
  unsupported filesystem semantics fail closed.

### Patch Changes

- 4661bbd: Recommend a 10-second default wait for foreground commands in agent instructions.
- 8a60104: Record Gmail startup authorization failures in diagnostics and let agents request in-conversation consent for enabled personal integrations whose tools are unavailable. Personal access continues to require the owner's explicit session grant.
- 1598498: Read repository Skill descriptions as YAML and advertise exact source-qualified identifiers with a live repository reader. Preserve sandbox-free managed Skill reading and sandbox attempt authorization. Valid multiline YAML descriptions retain their text; symlink entrypoints are excluded consistently with repository reads.

## 2.5.3

### Patch Changes

- e1a50ba: Spool Linux host-backed workspace archives through capture, object storage, and cold restore instead of materializing whole JSON/base64 payloads. Isolate each upload at a fresh physical locator and verify stored bytes without assuming conditional-PUT support. Preserve legacy locators, archive format, configured restore limits, and lease capture/publication authority; retain candidates after ambiguous publication outcomes.

### Patch Changes

- 6a60a58: Canonicalize typed Skill review cards using host-owned choices. Allow explicit
  authorized Save/Don't save responses to existing exact-bound cards with the
  legacy Other flag and null option descriptions, without rewriting cards,
  manufacturing consent, or weakening human, tenant, turn, or revision fences.

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- be17b8e: Remove the SDK Skill loader capability and use eager sandbox-free Skill reading
  with a turn-prepared descriptor index. Keep on-demand checkout and repository
  Skill discovery separate, and render Skill tool calls consistently in the timeline.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

### Patch Changes

- 5b17932: Make bundled runtime skills authoritative and remove their duplicate repository-agent skill sources.

## 2.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 5249b0d: Detach provider response item identities from portable checkpoint requests while preserving inline history and tool call/result correlation. This prevents Azure from rejecting a message whose opaque reasoning identity was omitted during compaction. Classify the known rejection without persisting provider message content.

  Explicitly disable tool selection for Azure-profile Responses checkpoints so historical tool records cannot yield a new tool call instead of summary text. Empty/provider failure safeguards remain unchanged.

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 068be26: Complete a Skill save in the same transaction as its one verified human chat decision. Show the full immutable Skill folder, preserve exact scope and revision checks, and refuse delegated, stale, or mismatched approval. Autonomous saves activate directly; declining a proposal preserves existing active guidance.
- 69924e8: Preserve structured model-history ordering through PostgreSQL replay and pending-tool recovery. Retain authorized uploaded images across turns and compaction input, preserve images in retained messages, and include their projected token cost in compaction retention budgets. Migration requires draining writers.
- d1cb266: Keep automatic history filling from evicting the latest reply or cycling between older and newer pages. Preserve explicit history navigation and stable jumps back to latest. Retain provider message identity so assistant chunks interleaved with tool activity remain one message without merging distinct replies.
- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 392c575: Retain Modal command handles, provider execution identities, output, and exact exit status across provider-client reconstruction. Persist stream pages before acknowledging their cursors, and treat unavailable historical locators as unknown rather than proof of process loss. Execution status is provider-owned and never read from sandbox-writable files.
- befd389: Preserve prompt-cache reuse across turns with unchanged governance by keeping attempt-specific snapshot receipt UUIDs out of system instructions. Stable content hashes, policy revisions, and skill retrieval handles remain model-visible; exact-attempt snapshot IDs remain in durable audit records.
- f3bd0d0: Preserve unknown Modal command observations instead of falsely settling local SDK handle loss as physical process loss. Retain exact command holders with explicit deferred/quarantine diagnostics while allowing the original owner's terminal proof to settle normally.
- 5904fd1: Remove the Site SDK endpoint allowlist. Workspace API requests now reach ordinary authorization handlers in published Sites and sandbox previews; tenant routing, agent permission limits, and direct integration-tool checks remain unchanged. Clarify the distinction between authoring, preview, and viewer access in the Sites skill, including honest reporting of viewer-only verification.
- 29551cb: Clarify that ancestor Pause interrupts the calling agent and that accepted coordination messages require identity-correlated delivery and result verification. Preserve existing recursive controls and discourage duplicate unconsumed messages.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fa12951: Separate command interaction from session history. Add bounded retained-output command reads and use the same operation for command waits. Terminal reads observe completion and suppress only still-pending completion notifications; running reads, claimed notifications, and historical tool results remain unchanged.

  Make session history conversation-first with complete-message pagination and explicit results, tools, and debug views. Preserve cursor detail selection, provide oversized-message continuation, and keep queued prompts distinct from processed conversation. Update concise model guidance for the new surfaces.

  `command_wait` now uses `waitSeconds`, an output cursor, and the same flat result as `command_read`; clients using the previous command wrapper must update. Apply the additive command-observation migration before starting the new readers.

- 575af5b: Expose workspace project management through MCP, including shared pins/order, session filing, project-filtered discovery and project selection at session creation. Bundle concise, on-demand project organization guidance for every agent, independent of compute backend and retain existing session authorization checks.

### Patch Changes

- 7dac7e3: Clarify that default CLI discovery lists every authorized tool with compact per-tool summaries, without schemas or an output-size cutoff.
- 22a6704: Correct oversized session-message continuation with bounded source slicing, preserve typed runner terminal failures during command observation, and keep retained command output readable when live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure. Refresh fallback rechecks API authorization and explicitly marks unavailable freshness; it does not mask integrity or authorization errors.
- c1dc59b: Guide agents through compact Codemode discovery followed by explicit single-tool schema inspection before calling an unfamiliar tool. Preserve the same authorized execution path for stock and Connected Machine CLIs.
- 09de906: Open absolute file links outside a Connected Machine session's working directory, including sibling worktrees. Preserve route identity checks and managed sandbox confinement.
- d8a70ec: Enforce the first-party MCP tool ceiling on current-human gateway and OAuth consent surfaces, propagate MCP OAuth deployment settings, and hide the undeliverable Sites Skill on Connected Machines.
- d06450c: Capture final provider HTTP request bodies for the context inspector, including conversation input and provider-normalized tools/settings. Keep unsupported or oversized captures explicitly unavailable, label section/item token estimates, and preserve transport cancellation and streaming behavior.
- c69ad5f: Preserve externally managed history across opaque compaction checkpoints and verify conversation persistence before continuation. Reject shifted history prefixes and conflicting saved items instead of silently losing completed work.
- 1c4b707: Expose goal_resume so agents can resume any paused goal without a pause-reason restriction; include it for existing sessions with goal_pause.
- 712967e: Recover typed Undici socket disconnections during safe first-party MCP initialization and tool discovery, while preserving terminal authentication failures and avoiding retries of tool invocations.
- ccbf227: Pin the project-local Site CLI alongside SDK packages so sandbox image age cannot select an incompatible catalog client.
- 66326b3: Compose Site package-version metadata in the skill manifest without writing into the worker application directory.
- b272df2: Explain how to correct repository fetch failures, including abbreviated commit references, while preserving valid branch, tag, PR ref, and full SHA behavior.
- eac6a61: End model execution after a successful trusted `wait_for_input` call, including
  calls routed through native shell and Codemode. Preserve settled tool receipts
  and normal worker completion without requiring a final assistant message.
- 2fb17fd: Track published Site session origin automatically; add origin-filtered session
  listing and skill defaults for reusable in-Site conversations. Site provenance
  remains independent of project placement and session authorization.
- 107aa14: Support standard SDK/React conversations in Sites and sandbox previews, direct
  HTML/source uploads, exact deployment package pins, and embedded layout/queue
  defaults. Refresh exhausted Grok capacity after external resets.
- 9e412ef: Add bounded tool listing and exact-name schema disclosure as a recovery path for keyword-search misses across native and generic transports. Backfill search results after schema-budget exclusions without changing authorization, approvals, or eager-tool policy.

  Prefer the connection-bound native Codemode client when available so an older installed CLI does not mask the supported Connected Machine path.

  The native Connected Machine client now sends the compiled API contract acknowledgement, with a cross-language parity test, and reports flat contract-mismatch errors rather than hiding their explanation.

  Native Codemode errors retain operation identity, observed outcome, and error details as JSON on stderr. A read-only journal command supports inspection without resubmitting tools. Packaged-client fixture verification covers JavaScript imports, CLI calls, and native recovery without probing customer tools.

- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b65383: Replace goal-scoped long waits with self-only session-level `wait_for_input`, add provider-neutral `command_wait`, and deliver terminal background-command proof as exactly-once durable agent input with workflow wakes for nonterminal sessions while preserving event-only audit for terminal sessions.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b420912: Show the exact model-visible system instructions, tools, skills, and token counts in the session Debug inspector.

### Patch Changes

- d63ee0f: Keep Connected Machine file links in the target's canonical filesystem namespace, including Windows drive and UNC roots, and reject stale file requests with a retryable route conflict.
- d8f84ac: Report repository Skill discovery timing without double-counting nested routed sandbox work.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.
- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- 8e2f71d: Contain pre-execution connector authority mismatches as model-visible tool errors instead of failing the whole agent turn.
- 6934f99: Prevent an active-goal status update from immediately spawning a continuation that repeats the same unchanged external wait. Status turns now establish an available goal hold when progress is genuinely blocked, while continuation turns avoid restating an already-reported wait before calling `goal_wait`.
- aa19556: Require agents to copy user-facing screenshots and artifacts into the workspace before emitting sandbox file links, preventing inaccessible links to temporary or host paths.
- 9e21a09: Generate pending semantic session titles in a bounded parallel model request so the main assistant response no longer waits on a title tool round trip, while retaining the serialized compatibility path for custom runtimes.
- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 59b286a: Add optional Modal CPU and memory reservations and preserve them through sandbox creation, exact resume, and snapshot replacement.
- 3a7fe2f: Reconcile retained-process terminal settlement races without leaving completed routes pinned.
- 7e67729: Prevent parent agents from duplicating delegated work. Child creation now requires an independent integration plan, and `session_wait` can ignore messages, goal/progress events, maintenance turns, and continuation segments until a child produces a result-bearing final turn or blocks.
- 9b844c8: Recover Modal command starts that fail on task-router DNS before connecting, while leaving generic unavailable, HTTP-status-bearing, mixed-tool, and sandbox-shutdown failures non-retryable.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 96624a7: Move agent computer interaction to managed ComputerSession tools. The legacy runtime desktop API remains exported only as a deprecated, fail-closed migration shell; because direct sandbox desktop control and model-bound tools are no longer functional, release `@opengeni/runtime` as the next major. Managed observations now carry bounded native image content for visual model input while preserving viewer control, explicit manual/on-verify recording, and historical contract parsing.

### Patch Changes

- 973b1dd: Keep a rejected best-effort MCP connection group fail-open and preparation-telemetered without downgrading required MCP connection failures.
- e41285f: Overlap optional MCP preparation with first inference even when artifact tooling is enabled, keep optional eager integrations off the first-token critical path, reuse immutable large-history projections incrementally, and expose fenced event-append phase latency without changing durable ordering.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 699477a: Restore autonomous agent Workspace Memory writes whenever workspace Memory is enabled. Agents can save and correct active facts, decisions, incidents, fixes, and outcomes independently of Learning mode while all existing Memory kinds remain retrieval-only through search. Autonomous learning may activate eligible concise Workspace instructions and focused Skills through their governed, auditable, undoable lifecycles; Review first keeps proposals inactive and Off creates no derived change.

### Patch Changes

- ec1aebc: Use the provider-valid workspace root for managed Browser and Computer controller commands while preserving the native `/tmp` cwd for Connected Machines.
- 3ef2488: Coordinate immutable Rig setup once per exact sandbox lease epoch and provider instance while keeping credentials, repositories, and files turn-private.

## 1.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 3c75347: Keep Agents SDK MCP lifecycle failures inside owned promises and reserve shared-worker process termination policy for OpenGeni.
- 551cead: Return durable retained-process exit or loss results to shell tools instead of rendering a retryable platform fault for an already-terminal command handle.
- 499cc48: Keep MCP lifecycle work on the awaited SDK path so optional server failures cannot leak from detached parallel workers.
- 37faec3: Replace the Agents SDK default batch trace exporter with OpenGeni's in-process preparation processor.

## 1.4.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [fd05df1]
- Updated dependencies [7988c84]
  - @opengeni/sdk@3.2.1

## 1.4.4

### Patch Changes

- c705de3: Bound session-control settlement reads to the requested session subtrees, avoid redundant workspace refreshes for session-scoped control events, and add low-cardinality MCP lifecycle telemetry with failure, latency, and runtime reliability alerts and dashboards.
- 95d3971: Use native Connected Machine browser control without bootstrapping a Linux display stack, and accept Modal's workspace-root diagnostic when selecting the secure streamed private-write fallback.

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 17d253b: Complete personal GitHub identity support across managed, self-hosted, and local modes. Add a compact connect-and-repository UI, exact local-human authority persistence, Docker-safe credential brokering, durable child and goal propagation, and reviewed GitHub tools for pull-request reviews and merges without exposing provider tokens to agents.
- c116379: Recover sessions containing legacy duplicate native tool-search pairs and prevent crash settlement from appending another pair when the provider correlation id is stored only in provider data.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 9ef491b: Add the Agent Knowledge product surface, Personal workspace knowledge views and defaults, workspace learning-autonomy administration, explicit routing guidance between Memory, Skills, and Workspace instructions, authority-first organization Document search, exact replay-safe confirmed Memory materialization, and the narrower organization identity/mission boundary with richer facts retrieved from organization knowledge.
- f6375f2: Accept sparse Responses output indices while preserving numeric provider order and duplicate-index rejection.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a78124f: Adopt the canonical Bun 1.4 toolchain, build the standalone ogtool CLI with Bun, and use Bun 1.4's corrected UTF-8 byte-length behavior in runtime context compaction.
- 16387c3: Keep ordinary MCP connections pinned to the complete vetted DNS answer under Bun and prefer IPv4 when a public dual-stack destination is available.
- 92324b5: Preserve lazy tool preparation while fencing every actual local tool call on the shared attempt preparation promise. Codemode now distinguishes a catalog that is still preparing from invalid or stale attempt authority, and repeated same-turn provider or MCP recovery stops after five automatic replacements with explicit terminal exhaustion evidence.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a9cd9e7: Add the default-off first-party GitHub REST MCP bridge with separate workspace-App and personal-OAuth actors, exact accepted-repository authority, reviewed read/write tools, connector-policy defaults for writes, Codemode parity, bounded credential-free results, and no replay after ambiguous mutations.

### Patch Changes

- c5c7e5a: Keep already-published eager and in-process model tool servers alive when deferred MCP preparation fails, so recovery surfaces the original preparation error and finalization still releases every resource exactly once.
- 5e9795c: Derive Connected Machine list state from the durable heartbeat cursor instead of a live ControlRpc ping on every `GET /machines`, and share one `useMachines` poll per workspace+session.
- 3398c2f: Retain the failed MCP request method, JSON-RPC phase, and bounded exact cause chain in durable recovery diagnostics without changing retry behavior or source error identity.
- e91d89e: Open Markdown `sandbox:` file links in the current session's Files workbench, preserve exact decoded paths through the selected filesystem authority, reveal deep lazy-tree ancestors, and handle malformed references safely.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- 8cb165d: Add the default-off personal GitHub smart-HTTP broker and managed-sandbox runtime consumer.
  Short encrypted attempt-bound bearers and stable repository-bound routes keep broad OAuth
  credentials server-side while exact connection, selection, live provider permission, and
  read/write authority are revalidated before every streamed Git request.
- 29a44c2: Spill oversized model-visible tool results to a workspace File instead of failing the tool or stuffing huge JSON into history. Codemode keeps the 16 MiB journal cap.

### Patch Changes

- 7d15265: Make eager-vs-lazy a function of tool origin, not provider transport: the base sandbox tools stay in the first request on every path, and Browser/Computer plus `generate_image`/`generate_video`/`get_video_generation_capabilities` hide behind search on Codex and OpenAI too.
- 1cd0eb0: Omit Responses output-only item `status` when persisting conversation history, and omit opaque `encrypted_content` from the portable compaction temporary copy, so SuperGrok-origin portable sessions can continue and compact on Codex. Keep the Codex wire strip as defense for already-stored rows and mid-turn SDK items. Durable history is not rewritten on a model switch.
- 3999dd5: Fail closed when Modal Computer/Browser is enabled without a digest-pinned desktop image, and classify a missing `opengeni-browserd-up` as unsupported instead of a retryable driver failure.
- cc2fa1b: Keep a live sandbox turn holder alive through a provider-deadline rotation: the resume-side holder-liveness loop releases only when the holder itself is gone or its attempt is superseded (`heartbeatLeaseHolderStatus` separates holder liveness from lease extension), the turn-side rotation checkpoint reinstates its exact lost holder at the same epoch/instance before the warm capture, mutation admission under a requested rotation reports `rotation_in_progress` instead of `lease_fenced` and starts that checkpoint, `write_stdin` to a retained PTY renders admission faults as the tool result instead of failing the turn, and `sandbox.box.terminated` carries the drain reason.
- 3141b5d: Clarify that first-request tool visibility is a closed non-MCP allowlist, and cover image/video adapter schemas in the lazy-transport tests.
- 650d6f9: Route OpenSandbox browser and computer streams through the API frame-proxy so the workbench can show live JPEG/RFB when the lifecycle proxy cannot carry browserd WebSocket grants.
- f51adf8: Add the reusable first-party local MCP bridge contract and adapter registry,
  and route Gmail's reviewed REST bridge through the generic adapter selection
  seam.
- 009b947: Teach agents to emit `sandbox:/workspace/...` markdown file links with an optional line number, matching the session renderer.
- 5b509be: Advertise cwd-relative sandbox file paths to the model, and return the SDK execCommand banner (exit code + stdout/stderr) from Connected Machines.
- 5a651c8: Add the blocking first-party `session_wait` MCP tool so an agent can wait for new durable events on child or peer sessions, or for its own pending machine input, in one bounded call instead of sleeping and polling `session_events`/`session_get`/`sessions_list`.

### Patch Changes

- f4afa19: Expose computer-use as ordinary `computer_*` function tools on every proven visual route. Stop advertising OpenAI's hosted computer tool.
- f4afa19: Resume requires_action only from the open suffix plus paired history. Pause stores the sentinel instead of a leftover SDK RunState heap.
- 994a743: Stage connected-machine browser-control request files inside the placement-private path accepted by the self-hosted agent, restoring browser and computer-use session creation without weakening the private filesystem boundary.
- 51123b4: Bind a remembered authorized tool name through one Agents SDK `resolveMissingFunctionTool` hook instead of a fake client `tool_search` inject. Codex/OpenAI native raw calls and generic `tool_invoke` share that path; unknown or revoked names return a typed model error instead of killing the turn.
- 8583779: Resume `requires_action` from paired history plus a bounded open suffix instead of materializing an oversized SDK RunState blob.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c2d958: Scoped stream tokens (`ogs_`, 120 s TTL unchanged) now carry the authenticated viewer subject and the session's live authority epoch (migration 0281). The viewer lease holder records the same pair monotonically, the API re-verifies a human viewer's current workspace membership at every mint and degrades the stream to `transport:null` when membership is gone, and the selfhosted relay fences an attach whose authority claim is below the channel's recorded floor. Pre-0281 tokens keep working during the rolling window and enforce nothing new.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 91d5caf: Add a provider-neutral operational instruction contract for consistent agent collaboration, execution safety, file editing, and skill usage across every OpenGeni persona. Keep persistent system instructions prompt-cache stable, project goal continuations once as canonical user messages, let authoritative human input supersede a pending continuation, and remove the unreliable inferred-progress pause.
- 987742d: Skip the redundant in-box rig marker probe when a live Modal session reports
  the exact immutable image that already passed the rig's content, source,
  provider-binding, and independent cold-boot verification. Missing or mismatched
  image identity retains the existing fail-closed marker and setup path.
- 987742d: Reduce turn-start overhead without reducing admitted history, rig variables, or
  user-visible content. Active history loads in one admitted query, automatic
  compaction skips duplicate history work below threshold, unchanged Codex
  credential pointers avoid redundant session-activity writes, rig defaults
  load at bounded concurrency for admitted worker attempts, and the attempt-scoped
  MCP wrapper no longer reuses a broader process-global tool list.

  Improve large-session interaction by measuring rich-message disclosure without
  a second React commit, showing truthful pending queue actions immediately, and
  replacing the false zero-step placeholder with the session's real lifecycle.

- c297fc0: Complete governed goal rewrites with strict agent change metadata, immutable
  proposal rejection and CAS-fenced rollback, bounded revision pagination, and
  accepted-turn root constraints that child agents may inherit or narrow. The
  original raw-array goal-revision list remains unchanged; bounded pagination is
  available through a separately named API and SDK surface.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

- 4d1ed07: Preserve complete bounded lazy-search tool schemas across durable model history, expose Linux desktop application launch when the image supports it, suppress the managed Chrome sandbox warning, label Computer sessions as Desktops in the UI, and keep AnyDoc available in headed desktop sandboxes.
- ce3b370: Restore the MPL-2.0 license and notice for the curated HashiCorp Terraform Skills in the published runtime package, and forward-repair the persisted Terraform Stacks provenance URL.
- e98daf6: Measure physical MCP tool calls by bounded structural outcome and lock the existing provider-declared error path with an HTTP-200 SDK/durability regression.
- e9e1016: Allow agent `goal_set` to replace completed goals while continuing to protect
  active and paused goal intent.
- d34dd9a: Add revision-fenced per-command memory and CPU policies for Connected Machines, exact live runner capability gating, and lifecycle-safe Linux operation accounting without introducing default resource limits.
- c3f0598: Materialize authorized connector attachments as exact, hash-verified sandbox files while keeping provider bytes and private download URLs out of model, Codemode, and durable event output.
- 79f57b5: Keep interaction discovery scoped to the current agent session by default, with explicit workspace inventory opt-in, so stale peer resources, reusable identities, and attached profiles cannot flood model context.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 083387e: Replace the removed per-turn `turnInstructions` system-prefix contract with generic per-message `modelContext` content. This is a breaking release-train cutover: old mutating clients are rejected after migration 0240. Context now enters canonical user history without standard timeline rendering, preserves the persistent prompt-cache prefix, and works across initial, queued, steer, realtime delegation, and transcript handoff paths.

### Patch Changes

  from execution progress, and add policy-controlled rewrite proposals with API,
  SDK, MCP, and runtime support.

### Patch Changes

- d86610d: Prevent deterministic model-generated worker-spawn failures, hide exhausted nested-agent creation, and show bounded structured session orchestration diagnostics in worker timeline rows while preserving the advanced public REST/SDK create contract.
- d86610d: Add opt-in document-parsing guidance for the pinned AnyDoc sandbox runtime.
- d86610d: Reissue the complete MCP result fidelity release source after the prior automated Version PR was merged without the required provider-native approval.
- 478d7fe: Add a reversible workspace memory prompt mode that removes the legacy standing memory block, keeps preference observations out of agent behavioral authority, contains company-profile context for child agents, and reports metadata-only model-context contribution telemetry.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace implicit optional Skill bundles and parallel Pack/session materialization paths with one explicit, provenance-bearing runtime Skill activation model. Curated Skills now require workspace installation, Pack ownership, or exact session selection; native artifact and video Skills remain available only with their matching executable tool surfaces.

  restore all bundled runtime skills to production API and worker process builds.
- 5c5ea4a: Add the universal capabilities platform with named API integration instances,
  provider-specific feature bindings, and local runtime adapters.
- 98e807e: Keep the normal remote context-compaction request unchanged, then recover once from an exact context-length rejection by temporarily reducing only tool-result bodies. Preserve the full durable history unless the retry returns a valid compaction checkpoint.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- cccc2b3: Split the package-private model-provider implementation into acyclic client,
  error, request-policy, routing, and transport modules while preserving the
  existing public runtime surface and provider behavior.
- 96965c2: Retain explicit image-tool outputs before they enter live agent history, preventing inline image bytes from reaching durable session history during SDK event/state ordering skew.
- a8e44ae: Extract provider client construction, request policy, and model routing into a package-private runtime module while preserving the existing public entrypoint and exports.

## 0.18.31

### Patch Changes

- b59e5bd: Wait for concurrent structured sandbox reads to settle and retry only typed transient failures once.

## 0.18.30

### Patch Changes

- 2727236: Make sandbox draining crash-safe with durable capture and teardown ownership, idempotent Modal snapshots, scoped operator holds, parallel Temporal reaping, exact lifecycle errors, and verified Local/Docker workspace recovery.
- c8eb465: Add explicit provider-contained lazy-tool transports: preserve Codex native search, use native client tool search for direct OpenAI/Azure Responses, and use a cache-stable ordinary search/invoke dispatcher for other function-calling providers.

## 0.14.11

### Patch Changes

- b7df541: Prevent provider-native checkpoint capture from racing sandbox operations while
  the provider has paused the source box. Capture now owns a durable
  lease/epoch/instance/generation claim, blocks new holders and mutations, drains
  provider-local reads before entering the exclusive snapshot call, and retains
  ownership through late provider settlement and exact stale-claim recovery.
  Modal's typed completed-exec stdin race is also normalized into a side-effect-free
  terminal poll, so an exec that exits between local lookup and the provider write
  settles its retained process instead of failing the enclosing turn.

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

### Patch Changes

- 43e3503: Honor configured MCP transport budgets during the outer Agents SDK connection lifecycle.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

### Patch Changes

- bdd531c: Make Codex subscription response timeouts recoverable without blindly replaying partially observed model work. The transport now assigns a durable request identity, records attempt-fenced start/headers/first-byte/terminal metadata, enforces explicit headers, stream-idle, and whole-request deadlines, and retries once only before any response is observed. Exhausted or partial-stream timeouts retain a typed failure class and return the durable session to its existing retryable recovery path instead of hard-failing it with the opaque OpenAI SDK `Request timed out.` error. External cancellation remains authoritative, the SDK retry budget remains disabled, and Codex subscription turns keep their existing zero-credit billing path.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- 3ce795b: Route Toolspace token seeding, renewal, agent commands, and Channel-A terminal
  commands through deterministic per-session files when several sessions share a
  sandbox group. Preserve the box manifest's stable legacy pointer for warm-box
  compatibility, remove any legacy bearer during seeding, and prevent the
  group-global ttyd process from inheriting session-bound Toolspace authority.
- 334b63f: Publish the dependency-free Toolspace CLI, consume its canonical source from stock sandbox images, and expose an exact deployment-pinned bootstrap hint so custom rigs and connected machines can install it without ever guessing `latest`.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 94f2580: Keep sandbox Toolspace and Code Mode available during unbounded turns by
  proactively re-signing the session-bound delegated bearer and atomically
  replacing its off-manifest token file on managed and connected-machine backends.
- b9d6e58: Bundle the OpenAI Agents implementation together with its required Zod 4 runtime so embedding hosts can retain an independent Zod major without silently changing Agents' schema identity, while keeping transitive runtime dependencies explicit and Node-compatible.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 28290a0: Make context compaction and pending tool-call recovery converge without reactivating superseded history or repeating failed internal turns.
- 9a7dec2: Keep captured workspace files and diffs usable when the live sandbox provider is temporarily unavailable, surface a truthful retryable degraded state, and distinguish provider failures from invalid workspace paths.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- 14ce2e3: Bound model-facing textual tool output with Codex-compatible, replay-idempotent semantics, account
  for complete current model input, make compaction failure/progress transitions

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a0cb58f: Streaming exec to Connected Machines over the op-stream protocol (server half).
  When a runner advertises the `op_stream` capability (persisted from its connect
  Hello onto the enrollment) and `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_STREAM_ENABLED` is on
  (default off), selfhosted exec streams as sequenced, acked, credit-flowed
  frames: no reply-size wall (retention-bounded, typed on overflow), blip-proof
  collection (re-attach + replay, blake3-verified byte-exact), and idempotent
  starts keyed by a durable per-tool-call op id so a re-dispatched turn attaches
  to the already-running command instead of re-running it. The legacy monolithic
  exec remains the permanent fallback wire form. The events bus gains an
  op-stream subscribe/publish accessor on the same managed NATS connection.

### Patch Changes

- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- ec508d4: Proactive context compaction now actually fires on the codex-subscription path: codex models declare their real (empirically measured) context window instead of inheriting the 1.05M global default, and the default compaction trigger moves from 60% to 90% of the declared window — compact as late as possible now that the window base is honest, with the reactive compact-on-reject ladder absorbing any overshoot.
- 477b2bb: Freeze the codex tool_search description for the whole turn once connectors are discovered, instead of re-rendering it from the live connector-namespace Set on every model call. A mid-turn Set change used to flip the tools block, which precedes the conversation history in the request prefix and so cold-started the entire prompt-cache prefix from that point on. The freeze locks the first discovered (non-empty) connector list and reuses it byte-stably for the rest of the turn; while the Set is still empty (discovery slow/failed) it falls back to a live render rather than freezing an empty list, so a turn's connectors are never silently disabled.
- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- 1132866: Surface the Connected Machine (selfhosted) exec-deadline hint on the stdout-only SDK path: when a command is killed at its exec deadline, `execCommand` now returns the "terminated at the N-second limit — run long jobs in the background and poll" hint as its output (alone when stdout is empty, appended after the partial output otherwise), instead of returning an empty string the model reads as "no output". The structured `exec()` result is unchanged (the hint stays on stderr for the Channel-A parsers); it now also carries a `timedOut` flag.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 832f84c: Re-sign the first-party MCP delegated bearer per request so a long turn never 401s on an expired token. The first-party (`opengeni`) MCP server's delegated bearer is signed with a 1-hour TTL and was baked into the StreamableHTTP connection headers once, at turn start. A turn or persistent MCP connection that outlived the TTL re-sent the stale bearer on its next request (a tool call or the SDK's per-step tools/list re-list), the endpoint rejected it with a 401 "authentication required", and — because the first-party server is required — the whole turn died (observed as a session that "ran fine for about an hour, then failed"). The bearer is now re-signed on every request by a dedicated first-party auth fetch wrapper (the same per-request `fetch` mechanism the connection broker already uses), so the token on the wire is always fresh and the endpoint never 401s, for a turn of any length. The change is scoped strictly to the delegated token we mint ourselves; external OAuth credentials (connection-broker-backed capability MCPs) are untouched and still degrade or fail-loud with human re-auth. A genuinely broken first-party auth still fails loud — the wrapper always sends a valid fresh token and never retries, so a persistent rejection surfaces as a hard connect failure rather than being masked.
- b125213: Proactively renew GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps credentials during multi-day managed-sandbox turns, atomically replacing stable token files without model action or manifest mutation.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 37ade2c: Never serialize the internal resume-message marker (`opengeni_internal_resume` in item providerData) to any model provider. The @openai/agents SDK spreads providerData keys verbatim into the wire item and strict Responses backends reject unknown per-item fields — in production every turn whose input contained a marked resume message failed deterministically with `400 Unknown parameter: 'input[N].opengeni_internal_resume'`, and because the marker is durable in replayed conversation history, retries could never succeed (sessions stayed dead). The sanitizer now strips the key from every history item and from the fresh trailing resume message before ANY model request; unrelated providerData keys are preserved and untouched items keep reference identity. Resume-notice detection (isInternalResumeMessage) reads stored history and keeps its text-prefix fallback, so compaction housekeeping degrades gracefully instead of ever failing a turn.
- 4a25bfc: Connected Machines read OFFLINE immediately on a clean going-offline. When a machine announces a typed GoingOffline (user-stop / self-update / host-shutdown) it now records a nullable `went_offline_at` + `went_offline_reason` marker on its enrollment, and the liveness derivation gives an un-cleared marker precedence over last_seen aging AND over a lingering liveness probe — so the dashboard and any work-routing decision see the machine as offline right away instead of waiting out the dead-detect window. A lifecycle `revoked` status still trumps the marker, and any newer liveness signal (a reconnect Hello or a fresher heartbeat) clears it back to null. Adds the `setEnrollmentWentOffline` and `clearEnrollmentWentOffline` DB helpers, threads the marker onto `EnrollmentRecord` and the `selfhostedLiveness` input, and clears it inside `touchEnrollmentLastSeen`.
- 63f9113: Isolate optional/best-effort MCP servers so an expired credential can never fail an unrelated turn. A best-effort server (an optional ToolRef, a connection-broker-backed capability MCP, or codex_apps) whose `tools/list` throws at run time — most often an expired/failed connection credential surfacing as a StreamableHTTP "authentication required" 401 — now degrades to zero tools for the turn instead of propagating out of the SDK's run-time `getAllMcpTools` and hard-failing the whole turn. Previously the best-effort isolation only wrapped the connect handshake, so a server that connected fine but had its credential expire by tool-listing time took down turns that never even used its tools. Required (explicitly-requested, non-best-effort) servers keep the fail-loud default: a `tools/list` failure still fails the turn. The actionable `tool.auth_needed` signal is preserved — the connection-broker fetch publishes it before returning the 401 that provokes the throw, so the drop is fully observable and the user still gets prompted to re-authenticate.
- f4a25d9: Isolate best-effort MCP tool INVOCATION failures so an optional server can never fail an unrelated turn — the invocation sibling of #379's tools/list fix. When the model calls a best-effort server's tool (an optional ToolRef, a connection-broker-backed capability MCP, or codex_apps) and the call throws for any reason — a raw transport 401/403 that never became the broker's JSON-RPC auth-needed short-circuit (e.g. a bearer that expired mid-turn), a provider 5xx, or a network blip — `PrefixedMcpServer.callTool` now returns a tool-error result the model sees instead of propagating the throw. A required server keeps the fail-loud default. The model-facing copy is loop-safe (it says the tool is unavailable for the rest of the turn and to not retry it, so the model moves on instead of re-calling a dead tool), and both the model text and the structured warn carry only the safe error surface (JS error class + numeric HTTP status), never the raw response body — a broker 401/403 body can echo request detail. The existing auth-needed short-circuit and its `tool.auth_needed` signal are unchanged and take precedence. The same errorClass/status-only surface is applied to the #379 tools/list warn for consistency. The mid-turn tools/list RE-LIST path was already covered by #379 (the guard is on the `PrefixedMcpServer.listTools` instance method, which every re-list goes through); a regression test locks it.
- 726cf2c: Make Connected Machine (selfhosted) control ops resilient: bounded retry of pre-admission DRAINING backpressure (patient ~60s budget for exec, short ~5s for other ops) and of a single transient TIMEOUT (read-only idempotent ops only — a timed-out mutation is never re-issued), a separate exec deadline distinct from the short control timeout (new `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` / `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 2min/30s), and actionable, human-language error copy for over-limit payloads, capacity backpressure, and exec-deadline termination.
- 0f10413: Make Connected Machine (selfhosted) faults legible to the agent in-band. The `exec_command` tool now returns a four-field rendering (what happened / which layer / what was preserved / what to try) with a correct retry verdict — machine-offline and consent faults no longer reach the model mislabelled "Please try again". PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE is typed with a distinguishing flag and rendered with the size wall plus recovery moves (redirect to a file, read in chunks). A transient offline blip the transport KNOWS occurred pre-send (no connection / no responder — the op provably never reached the machine) now heals with a short bounded retry for any op kind, while an ambiguous post-send fault is never blindly re-issued.
- 3148404: Add a transport-agnostic per-op observation seam (`SelfhostedOpObserver`) to the Connected Machine control path, plus a metrics sink and the fault taxonomy for the `machine.op.*` session events. `SelfhostedSession.call` invokes an optional injected observer once per completed op with op-shaped telemetry (op kind, ok/failed outcome, healed-after-retry flag, retry count, typed code/reason, never-sent, duration, machine id, a stable `selfhostedFaultClass`, and reply bytes on a payload-wall fault). The observer is guarded so a telemetry sink can never break an op, and it is threaded through the sandbox client/build + routing resolver so the worker can wire it. `RuntimeMetricsHooks` gains `onSandboxOp` for op-outcome counters/histograms; `selfhostedFaultClass` + `SELFHOSTED_INFRASTRUCTURE_FAULT_CLASSES` single-source the class taxonomy that gates the `machine.op.*` events (infrastructure faults + healed recoveries only). The op-engine's future op-stream client emits through the same observer interface.
- 1d57c33: Keep Connected Machine control liveness responsive under bounded host work, propagate finite exec deadlines to the machine, and retry transient control-bus connection acquisition.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 27a114c: Record a provider-reported `cached_tokens: 0` as 0 in model-call usage telemetry instead of null. The previous >0-only filter made "the provider cached nothing" indistinguishable from "no telemetry returned" — which is exactly how 10k+ genuinely-uncached Azure gpt-5.6 calls masqueraded as a telemetry gap during the 2026-07-12 incident forensics. Absent detail objects still record null (unknown). Pricing is unaffected (null and 0 both bill the uncached rate); dashboards gain an honest zero.
- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e7a243: Support PRIVATE-registry Modal sandbox images via `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`.

  The Agents-extension Modal backend resolves `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REF` (and any pack
  `sandboxImage` that overrides it) with `Image.fromRegistry(tag)` and no secret, so it could
  only pull PUBLIC images. New optional setting `modalImageRegistrySecret` (env
  `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`) names a Modal Secret holding `REGISTRY_USERNAME` +
  `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`; when set, the runtime resolves that Secret and pre-builds
  `fromRegistry(tag, secret)` ONCE per worker process (`ensureModalRegistryImage`, awaited in
  `createOpenGeniWorker` boot) and the Modal provider selects it via
  `ModalImageSelector.fromImage(...)`. When unset the behavior is byte-identical to today's
  public-image path (and the modal SDK is never loaded for it). Resume/attach turns never pull
  the image, so they are unaffected.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b34b912: Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

  Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

  When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.
