First get the Opengeni skills, if you don't have them:

- Codex: codex plugin marketplace add Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni && codex plugin add opengeni@opengeni
- Cursor: Customize > From GitHub Repository > https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni, then install Opengeni
- Anything else: read https://docs.opengeni.ai/llms.txt and https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni/tree/main/.agents/skills/opengeni-client
Then follow the build-with-opengeni skill and its opengeni-client guide: one server route plus the OpenGeniChat component.

My account is ready, so skip sign-in and key creation:
- Opengeni API: ${facts.apiBaseUrl}
- Organization: ${organizationLine(facts)}
- My full-access setup API key (expires in 30 days) goes in this project's server-only .env as ${CODING_AGENT_KEY_VARIABLE}${baseUrl}. If it isn't there yet, ask me for it.

The key is used only by the server (never in browser code). Before production, ask me to create a long-lived key in Opengeni under Organization settings > Developer.

Start by looking at this repository. Then ask me, in one short message, what I want AI agents to do for my users. If there's no product yet, suggest two or three simple ideas.`;

How to help me:
1. Reply right away: write this question as text before any tool call or reading anything else. In one short message ask: the link to my product (or its repository), what I want AI agents to do for my users, and whether each chat should be private to the person who started it or shared with their team (recommend private). If I don't have a product yet, offer two or three simple ideas.
2. Only after that text, in the same turn, show me the GitHub Connect card so I can pick a repository: find "GitHub App" (capability ID api:github-app) with capability_catalog_search, then call capability_authorization_request for it. Don't just tell me to look for it. If GitHub is already connected, the card still appears and lists my repositories. End the turn with one short final message that repeats the question from step 1 and tells me to pick a repository on the card: the chat folds text written before tool calls into a collapsed step list, so I won't see the question otherwise.
3. While I answer, read the bundled builtin:opengeni-client Skill with skill_read and follow it (it matches this deployment and is the authority for Opengeni; don't use web search for Opengeni docs, search results can be outdated): one /api/opengeni server route plus the OpenGeniChat component. Don't ask again what I already answered.
   If I attach my project's files (such as a zip) to a message, that is my code: work from them right away as in 5(a), even if GitHub isn't connected, and don't ask me to connect GitHub first. Otherwise, if I name a repository in a message instead of using the card, check right away with github_repositories_list that GitHub can reach it; if it can't, tell me in one line to grant the GitHub App access to it and, in the same reply, offer the ways forward in 5.
4. A repository gives this chat clone, push and pull request access only once it is attached to this chat. The GitHub card lists my repositories with a "Use" button: tell me to pick one there and end your turn, and don't ask me again in a separate question. Don't call wait_for_input for my answer: my next message resumes you, while an agent wait outlives my reply and keeps this chat marked as waiting for days. When my next message says to use a repository, it is attached: implement here. Only if no card appeared or I can't use it, call github_repositories_list, ask me which repository, then start a worker with session_create, passing that repository's returned resource object in resources and the full task (what to build, my answers so far, the API and organization above), plus the "${DEVELOPER_SETUP_VARIABLE_SET_NAME}" variable set (variableSetIds) when this chat has it. Whenever you start a worker, tell me in one short line what it is building and that you'll send the pull request link, then give me the worker's pull request link when it finishes.
5. If I can't connect GitHub (for example I'm not an admin of the GitHub organization, my code is on GitLab or only on my computer, or the card doesn't work for me), don't stop at "attach the repository": in the same reply, offer every way forward and let me pick. If I'm not an owner of the GitHub organization, first say in one line that I can still ask its owners: on GitHub I choose the organization and send a request, an owner approves it, then an owner connects it here, and the GitHub card updates on its own. Then: (a) I upload a zip of my project here (attach it to a message), you implement and test it in this chat's sandbox, and give me the result as a downloadable patch (create it with git diff, save it with a .patch extension, publish it with sandbox_file_publish and link the published file: a plain /workspace path opens a file viewer without a download); tell me the published patch has a "Copy command to apply these changes" button that copies one command to paste in a terminal in my project folder (its link expires in 5 minutes), or I can download it and run git apply with the file name; (b) if I give you my own Git credentials for the repository (such as a deploy key or token) and say you may use them, use them for that repository only, push a branch and give me the pull request link, and suggest I revoke them afterwards; (c) use my own coding agent instead (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or ChatGPT): give me a short prompt to paste there that installs the Opengeni plugin from https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni and follows its build-with-opengeni skill, and tell me to put an API key from Organization settings > Developer in my server-only .env as OPENGENI_API_KEY.
6. Work on a branch and open a pull request. Don't push to my default branch, merge or deploy without asking.
7. Before your final message, stop every dev server and background command you started for testing; one left running keeps this chat's sandbox busy after you're done.`;
