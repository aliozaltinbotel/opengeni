# @opengeni/sdk

Framework-agnostic TypeScript SDK for the OpenGeni public API: a typed client,
session lifecycle, and the streaming core — SSE event streaming with automatic
reconnect, resume-by-sequence, gap backfill, and duplicate suppression — plus
helpers for proxying the stream through your own API.

For the complete product boundary—organization API keys, organization
workspaces, Personal-workspace exclusion, tenant mapping, and external Skill
ownership—start with the canonical
[product integration guide](../../docs/product-integration.md).

Runtime dependencies are the published `@opengeni/contracts` wire schemas (which
bring Zod) and `@opengeni/connect`; nothing else. It needs only WHATWG `fetch`
and streams, so it runs in Node 18+, Bun, Deno, browsers, and edge runtimes.
The package is ESM-only (no `require` entry): use `import`, or `await import()`
from CommonJS.

Always pass `baseUrl` (for example `process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL`): the
chat facade defaults to production `https://app.opengeni.ai`, so omitting it
against a staging or self-hosted deployment silently talks to production.

Browser clients may call the public API from any origin with an explicitly safe
bearer design, but an organization API key belongs on the product server.
Browser cookies are accepted cross-origin only from operator-configured trusted
origins; arbitrary embedding origins never receive credentialed CORS responses.

## Embed the conversation (default)

The default product integration is the full OpenGeni conversation:
`@opengeni/react`'s `SessionConversation` in the browser, backed by this SDK
through a tenant/user-scoped same-origin proxy on your server.
`createSessionProxyHandler` is that proxy, packaged:

```ts
// Server: mount at /api/opengeni/* (see the framework adapters below).
import { OpenGeniClient, createSessionProxyHandler } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const og = new OpenGeniClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});

export const handler = createSessionProxyHandler(og, {
  resolve: async (request) => {
    const me = await authenticate(request); // your session/cookie check
    if (!me) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    return { workspaceId: me.openGeniWorkspaceId, user: me.userId, source: "acme-app" };
  },
  authorizeMutation: (request) => verifyCsrf(request), // your existing CSRF policy
  // Optional. Omit to keep session creation purely server-side.
  createSession: ({ initialMessage, idempotencyKey }) => ({
    initialMessage,
    idempotencyKey: idempotencyKey ?? crypto.randomUUID(),
    tools: [{ kind: "mcp", id: "acme" }], // explicit, server-chosen tool selection
    firstPartyMcpTools: [],
  }),
});
```

```tsx
// Browser: the unmodified SDK client, pointed at your mount.
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";
import { OpenGeniChat, OpenGeniProvider } from "@opengeni/react";
import "@opengeni/react/compiled.css";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/api/opengeni" });
<OpenGeniProvider client={client} workspaceId={workspaceId}>
  {/* The user's chat list plus the conversation; or <SessionConversation sessionId={id} />. */}
  <OpenGeniChat />
</OpenGeniProvider>;
```

Framework adapters are thin wrappers over the same web-standard handler (they
also accept `createChatHandler` or any `(Request) => Promise<Response>`):

```ts
// Next.js App Router: app/api/opengeni/[...path]/route.ts
import { createSessionProxyRoute } from "@opengeni/sdk/next";
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE } = createSessionProxyRoute(og, { resolve });

// Express / Connect / node:http (mount before body parsers, or they are re-serialized)
import { toNodeMiddleware } from "@opengeni/sdk/express";
app.use("/api/opengeni", toNodeMiddleware(handler));

// Hono
import { toHonoHandler } from "@opengeni/sdk/hono";
app.all("/api/opengeni/*", toHonoHandler(handler));
```

The Next adapter passes the full URL, including any `basePath`; the Node
middleware rebuilds it from `originalUrl`, streams bodies and SSE, and aborts
the request when the client disconnects.

The chat list (`SessionList` / `OpenGeniChat`) uses `listSessionPage`. By
default (`sessionList: "mine"`) the proxy adds a creator filter for the
resolved user server-side, so each user sees only the chats they started;
`sessionList: "visible"` lists every chat OpenGeni lets the user read in the
workspace, and `false` disables listing. Archive and restore go through
`updateSessionArchive` unless `archive: false`. A "New chat" in `OpenGeniChat`
sends only `{ initialMessage, idempotencyKey }`, so it needs the
`createSession` hook.

Every request calls `resolve`, then runs through `asUser(user, { source })`
(there is no service-authority fallback) against exactly the resolved
workspace. Only the native routes `OpenGeniProvider` and the conversation use
are served: client config; workspace read, model catalog, live control stream,
and workspace Resume; session read/rename, events (list and SSE with
`Last-Event-ID` resume), send/steer/approval/human-input, queue, composer
draft, pause/resume; and, unless `files: false`, attachment upload and download
URLs. Every other route or method is a 404 (cancel and workspace Pause are
refused); unknown query parameters on served reads pass through. Browser session creation is disabled
unless you supply `createSession`; the browser may then send only
`initialMessage` and `idempotencyKey`, and your hook returns the full request
(tools, MCP servers, Skills, instructions, model policy). Message bodies are
capped by `maxBodyBytes` (1 MiB), cannot rotate MCP credentials or attach
anything but files, and `modelSelection: false` strips per-message model
choices. `authorizeSession(sessionId, context)` adds a product-level session
check on top of OpenGeni's own membership and visibility checks. Without
`authorizeMutation`, only cross-site (`Sec-Fetch-Site`) mutations are refused,
so cookie-authenticated hosts should pass their CSRF check.

`beforeForwardMessage(message, context)` runs before every forwarded user
message (send, steer, composer submit, and a browser-started create) and may
return server-owned additions, or a `Response` to refuse the message:

```ts
createSessionProxyHandler(og, {
  resolve,
  beforeForwardMessage: async ({ sessionId, delivery }, { user }) => ({
    // Model-visible, placed before any context the browser sent.
    modelContext: `Page ${currentPage(user)} · ${timeZone(user)} · ${today()}`,
    // Header-only rotation of MCP servers already attached to the session,
    // applied atomically as the message is accepted (ignored on create).
    mcpCredentialUpdates: [
      { id: "acme", headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await mintUserToken(user)}` } },
    ],
  }),
});
```

This is the per-user tool token pattern: create the session with
`mcpServers: [{ id: "acme", url, headers }]` (and `tools: [{ kind: "mcp", id:
"acme" }]`, which the acting user needs `mcp_servers:attach` to attach), then
hand the MCP server a fresh short-lived bearer on every message. The browser
still cannot send `mcpCredentialUpdates` itself. With `modelSelection: false`
the proxy reports `modelSelection: false` in the client config, and
`SessionConversation` hides its model picker.

Onboard each user explicitly before their first request (see
[External users](#external-users-asuser)); the proxy never grants membership.
The conversation needs `workspace:read`, `sessions:read`, `sessions:control`,
plus `sessions:create` when the user creates sessions and `files:upload` /
`files:read` for attachments. Pass the facade from `@opengeni/sdk/chat` instead
of a client to resolve `{ tenant, user }` through `ensureWorkspace`.

## Quick start

```ts
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});

const session = await client.createSession(workspaceId, {
  initialMessage: "Investigate the failing deploy on staging",
  resources: [{ kind: "repository", uri: "https://github.com/acme/app.git", ref: "main" }],
  // Exact model-visible first-party surface; permissions remain independent.
  firstPartyMcpTools: ["set_session_title"],
});

for await (const event of client.streamEvents(workspaceId, session.id)) {
  if (event.type === "agent.message.delta") {
    process.stdout.write((event.payload as { text: string }).text);
  }
}
```

## Organization-backed product setup

A multi-tenant product should hold one organization API key on its backend and
idempotently map each product tenant to an OpenGeni organization workspace. The
wire kind for an organization workspace is `"shared"`; Personal workspaces are
excluded.

```ts
const client = new OpenGeniClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});

const organizationId = process.env.OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_ID!;
const { workspace, created } = await client.ensureWorkspace({
  accountId: organizationId,
  externalSource: "acme-product",
  externalId: tenant.id,
  name: tenant.displayName,
});

if (workspace.kind !== "shared") {
  throw new Error("Product integrations require an organization workspace");
}
```

The response is `{ workspace, created }`. Replays return the original nested
workspace with `created: false`. For an organization key, `getAccessContext()`
does not enumerate every workspace grant; call `listWorkspaces()` for the
complete organization-workspace inventory.

Organization key administration uses `listOrganizationApiKeys`,
`createOrganizationApiKey`, and `deleteOrganizationApiKey`. The key token from a
create response is shown once and must be stored in the backend's secret
manager. `createOrganizationApiKey(organizationId, { name, access: "read" })`
mints a read-only master key: it inventories shared workspaces and reads their
sessions, events, and files, but cannot create sessions, send messages, or mint
keys, and every key reports its tier as `apiKey.access`. Either tier can call
`listOrganizationSessions(organizationId, { limit, cursor, scopeSubjectId, status })`
for one page of sessions across every shared workspace (each row carries its
`workspaceId`; private sessions and Personal workspaces never appear), or
`iterateOrganizationSessions` to follow `nextCursor` to the end.

The external backend also owns its Skill catalog. Load the selected definitions
and pass them inline in `CreateSessionRequest.skills` for each product-created
session. There is no organization-wide Skill registry or Skill inheritance in
this integration contract. See the canonical guide for the complete route map,
security boundary, and delivery checklist.

Installed Skills can be workspace-managed or marked `session_selected`.
Session-selected guidance is exposed to no agent
until `createSession` names the reviewed immutable component in
`installedSkillIds`. OpenGeni copies that exact artifact into the new session,
so omitting the field from customer-facing creates is a real contamination
boundary rather than a prompt convention.
The ordered selection is part of keyed-create identity: reusing an
`idempotencyKey` with a different selection returns a conflict instead of the
session configured by the earlier request.

For session lists, `deriveSessionDisplayTitle(session)` returns the durable
agent/user title when available. While the automatic title is still pending, it
shows the first short, sensitive-safe line of the opening prompt, skipping an
unsafe pasted URL or identifier when later safe text exists. If no safe line is
available, a short session reference keeps rows distinguishable. The display
automatically yields to the later `session.title_set` value.

Browser consoles that do not need operator-only surfaces can import
`OpenGeniBrowserClient` from `@opengeni/sdk/browser`. Document authority migration
and Default-collection backfill methods stay available on the backward-compatible
root and `@opengeni/sdk/core` clients, or through the focused
`@opengeni/sdk/document-authority` entry:

```ts
import { OpenGeniDocumentAuthorityClient } from "@opengeni/sdk/document-authority";

const operatorClient = new OpenGeniDocumentAuthorityClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## External users (`asUser`)

On a product backend, `client.asUser(externalId, { source? })` returns a separate
client that sends the external actor assertion with the organization key. IDs
are opaque and case-sensitive; the default source is `default`. Keep the key and
this client server-side. Each request requires the intersection of the key's
permissions and the user's explicit workspace membership. API-key rotation does
not change the external identity.

Use the service client—not an `asUser` client—to call
`addExternalWorkspaceMember(workspaceId, { identity: { externalId, source? }, permissions })`
for explicit onboarding. It requires `members:manage`, cannot grant more than
the key permits, excludes Personal workspaces, and refuses to overwrite an
existing membership with different permissions; change an existing member's permissions with the keyed
`updateExternalWorkspaceMember(organizationId, workspaceId, organizationMembershipId,
{ operationId, permissions })`, which never tears down work. Ordinary `asUser` calls never
restore removed workspace membership or reactivate disabled identities.

Service `removeWorkspaceMember` supports external members through the existing
fenced workspace teardown. Account-wide `updateExternalIdentityMembership(
organizationId, organizationMembershipId, { kind, expectedAuthorizationRevision,
operationId, reason? })` requires explicit `account:admin` and supports suspend,
reactivate, and offboard. The membership ID is returned by onboarding; its initial
authorization revision is 1. Retain the returned revision for subsequent changes.
Reactivation restores admission, not revoked memberships or work. Offboarding
follows existing retention policy and cannot be reactivated through this API.
Native-user targets and `asUser` calls are rejected by this service endpoint.

An `asUser` client can discover/access its own provisioned Personal workspace
under the key's permission ceiling. Core private session operations retain
organization readiness/settings and explicit sharing acknowledgments; service
clients gain no Personal-workspace fallback.

Optional native-account delegation uses `beginIdentityLink`, authenticated native
`previewIdentityLink`/`confirmIdentityLink`, and explicit server-side
`asLinkedUser(externalId, { source?, linkId, expectedLinkRevision })`. Confirmation
requires the actual native login plus the one-time host challenge; an organization
key cannot confirm for the native user. `listIdentityLinks(workspaceId, cursor?)`
returns only the effective participant's links in that organization (50 per page).
`revokeIdentityLink` requires the observed revision. Linking never changes ordinary
`asUser`, merges histories or transfers credentials. Link-dependent accepted work
retains revocation checks across schedules and children. Short-lived inline MCP
credentials remain supported, and durable renewal stays opt-in.

Connect accepts an optional `installationTarget: { instanceKey, displayName,
expectedInstanceVersion? }`. Keep the exact observed version for an existing named
account. Setup freezes the target through callback and operation review; omitting
it creates an independent named account instead of overwriting a default instance.

## Chat facade fallback (`@opengeni/sdk/chat`)

Use this only when your product already has its own chat UI speaking Vercel
`useChat` or an OpenAI-shaped protocol and you want a compatible drop-in
backend, or for server-side bots (`og.chat(...).send()`). It is a text-only
projection: tool outputs are dropped (the Vercel adapter emits no tool parts
by default, and only `output: { status }` with `toolParts: true`), there are no
files, attachments, artifacts, or images,
no goals/queue/steer UI, and reopening restores only a text snapshot. For
anything else, use [the default conversation embed](#embed-the-conversation-default).

One option object per conversation, one server handler for your endpoint.
Tenants map to organization workspaces, conversations map to deterministic
sessions, and the organization API key never leaves your server.

```ts
import { OpenGeni, createChatHandler } from "@opengeni/sdk/chat";

const og = new OpenGeni({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!, // omitted = production https://app.opengeni.ai
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
  organizationId: process.env.OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_ID!,
  source: "acme-app", // labels your product's tenants and users (default "app")
});

// Once per user, when your product admits them to the tenant. Chat requests
// never grant workspace membership; without it the API answers 403.
await og.client.addExternalWorkspaceMember(await og.workspaceId({ tenant: "acme" }), {
  identity: { externalId: "u_42", source: og.source },
  permissions: ["workspace:read", "sessions:create", "sessions:read", "sessions:control"],
});

const chat = await og.chat({
  tenant: "acme", // one workspace per customer, created on first use
  user: "u_42", // authenticated product user; onboard workspace membership first
  conversation: "c_9", // stable conversation id, independent of the acting user
  agentAccess: "session", // "session" (default) | "user" | "workspace"
  memory: "user", // "user" | "workspace" | false; session-only agent reach defaults to false
  create: { sandboxBackend: "none" }, // raw create-request passthrough for a pure chat
});

const reply = await chat.send("hello"); // creates the session on the first send
console.log(reply.text); // or String(reply); the answer, without progress commentary

// Per message: model policy and model-visible page context (not shown in the transcript).
await chat.send("Why did revenue dip?", {
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  reasoningEffort: "low",
  modelContext: "Viewing dashboard 42, range 2026-09-01..2026-09-28",
});

for await (const chunk of chat.stream("and then?")) {
  if (chunk.type === "text") process.stdout.write(chunk.text);
  if (chunk.type === "pending") await chat.respond({ requestId: chunk.pending.requestId, decision: "approve" });
}

// Your endpoint. `resolve` is your auth hook: identity comes from the request
// you authenticated, never from the body. The handler reads the client's
// conversation id itself (x-opengeni-conversation header, or the wire format's
// own field) and authorizes as `user`; return `conversation` from resolve only
// when the host names it, which is required when there is no `user`.
export const handler = createChatHandler(og, {
  resolve: async (request) => {
    const session = await getSessionFromCookie(request);
    if (!session) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    return { tenant: session.accountId, user: session.userId };
  },
  // format: "vercel" | "openai-chat" | "openai-responses" (default "native");
  // a request may override it with the x-opengeni-chat-format header.
});
export const GET = handler; // conversation history, for restoring the chat on reload
export const POST = handler; // send a message, or answer a pending request at .../respond
```

Conversation IDs do not change with the acting user. Authorized collaborators
can use the same session; private visibility prevents access by other users.
Use `chatBySessionId` for existing and legacy user-namespaced conversations.
User mode requires explicit workspace membership and never restores removed
membership automatically. Without a `user`, the host must name the conversation
from `resolve`. The Vercel and OpenAI adapters send only the latest user
message; the earlier messages in that request are imported once, as context on
the first message of a conversation, after which OpenGeni owns the history.

Pick the isolation per session with `agentAccess` (which other sessions the
agent may reach) and `memory` (what it remembers), all inside one workspace that
shares the customer's documents, instructions, and integrations:

| Scenario                                          | `agentAccess` | `memory`      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Agent confined to its chat tree (support desk)    | `"session"`   | `false`       |
| One user's chats see each other, not other users' | `"user"`      | `"user"`      |
| Everything in the tenant shared                   | `"workspace"` | `"workspace"` |
| Shared agent access, no memory                    | any           | `false`       |

To keep an existing `useChat` route with its own request body, stream the chat
into your AI SDK response yourself. The Vercel format speaks the v1 UI message
stream used by AI SDK 5, 6, and 7 (tool approval requests need 6 or later):

```ts
import { createUIMessageStream, createUIMessageStreamResponse } from "ai";
import { uiMessageStreamParts } from "@opengeni/sdk/chat";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages, dashboardId } = await request.json(); // your own body
  const me = await authenticate(request);
  const chat = await og.chat({ tenant: me.accountId, user: me.userId, conversation: me.chatId });
  const text = lastUserText(messages);
  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    execute: async ({ writer }) => {
      const chunks = chat.stream(text, { modelContext: `Dashboard ${dashboardId}` });
      for await (const part of uiMessageStreamParts(chunks, { framing: false })) {
        writer.write(part as never);
      }
    },
  });
  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
```

OpenGeni's own tool activity is omitted by default because those tools are not
in your typed tool set; pass `toolParts: true` (or `createChatHandler(og, {
toolParts: true })`) to emit them as `dynamic`, provider-executed tool parts.
Pending approvals are always emitted as dynamic tool parts with a
`tool-approval-request`.

The chat handler is backend-only: connect a custom or compatible frontend to
its protocol. For the full React agent experience, use `SessionConversation`
with `OpenGeniClient` and authenticated session routes, not this simplified
chat protocol. The normal SDK preserves files, tools, approvals with policies,
forks, and realtime voice.

## Related-work discovery

`listAgentTopology` returns a bounded hierarchy page plus provider-neutral
`relatedWork` evidence. A text query searches durable semantic titles, active
goals, and typed work claims; it never searches the opening prompt. An exact
subject filter looks up one canonical typed identity:

```ts
const page = await client.listAgentTopology(workspaceId, {
  query: "permission scoped discovery",
  statuses: ["running", "requires_action"],
  activeOnly: true,
  recentHours: 72,
  claimLimit: 4,
});

for (const session of page.sessions) {
  if (!session.relatedWork.possibleOverlap) continue;
  console.log(session.title, session.relatedWork.match, session.relatedWork.claims);
}

const exact = await client.listAgentTopology(workspaceId, {
  subject: {
    namespace: "github",
    type: "pull_request",
    canonicalKey: "acme/app#42",
  },
});
```

The evidence is always advisory: `advisoryOnly` and `noAdditionalAccess` are
literal `true` fields, and receiving a row does not authorize detail, message,
or control operations. Preserve `nextCursor` with the exact same filters;
relevance cursors are filter- and activity-snapshot-bound. A topology response
may carry `humanAdvisoriesEnabled: false`, which lets a human-facing client hide
the advisory UI without changing stored evidence or API authority. See
[`docs/work-discovery.md`](../../docs/work-discovery.md) for ranking, bounds,
claim lifecycle, and rollout semantics.

## Full-history message search

`searchSessionMessages(workspaceId, { query, sessionId?, groupBy?, archiveStatus?, limit?,
cursor? }, { signal? })` searches durable user and **completed assistant** text,
including unloaded history. It returns every non-overlapping literal occurrence,
not tools, reasoning, model context, or delta-only assistant output.

Each match has a durable `eventId`/`sequence`, a UTF-16 `messageMatchOffset`, and
`snippet: { text, matchStart, matchEnd }` with original-text UTF-16 offsets.
Results include `nextCursor`, `hasMore`, cumulative `matchedMessageCount` and
`matchedOccurrenceCount`, `scannedMessages`, and `countIsExact`. Keep following
cursors even on empty pages while `hasMore` is true; counts are provisional until
exhaustion. Cancel superseded searches with the third argument's AbortSignal.
This is a live, authorized traversal rather than a frozen snapshot; restart to
refresh after concurrent history or visibility changes.

For workspace search, `groupBy: "session"` returns the first hit per matching
session and skips that session's remaining history, keeping prolific messages
from filling multiple picker pages. It cannot be combined with `sessionId`.
In grouped mode both matched counters count session representatives, not full
per-session message/occurrence totals; `scannedMessages` counts only visited
messages. Cursors bind the grouping mode. Omit it for every-occurrence Find.

The method and types are exported from the ordinary SDK and browser entry.
Use `listEventPage` around the hit's sequence for bounded context, and use the
returned search snippet when a large source message's ordinary projection does
not include the hit. Never download complete history to perform Find locally.
See [the API contract and bounds](../../docs/session-message-search.md).

## Session visibility and forks

For organizations with session-tenancy activation, a canonical managed-cookie
owner can change a fully quiescent session between private and workspace
visibility or create an independent same-workspace private or workspace-visible fork. API keys and
delegated/service bearers are intentionally not authority for these methods.
The browser client below intentionally omits `apiKey`; its same-origin request
carries the authenticated managed-session cookie.

```ts
const browserClient = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: window.location.origin });
const current = await browserClient.getSession(workspaceId, sessionId);
if (!current.tenancy) throw new Error("Session tenancy is not activated");

await browserClient.updateSessionVisibility(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  visibility: "private",
  expectedAuthorityEpoch: current.tenancy.authorityEpoch,
  idempotencyKey: crypto.randomUUID(),
});

const fork = await browserClient.forkSession(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  idempotencyKey: crypto.randomUUID(),
  visibility: "workspace",
  // Required when private conversation content is copied into workspace scope.
  workspaceSharedAcknowledged: current.tenancy.visibility === "private",
});
```

Retain each idempotency key until the request has a known outcome. If a
transport failure reports `outcomeUnknown`, retry the same operation with the
same key. An authority-epoch conflict requires a fresh `getSession` and a new
user decision. A quiescence conflict identifies the stable blocker after live
turns, goals, realtime, schedules, workspace writers, retained processes, and
sandbox access have been settled. Forks copy exact same-workspace durable
conversation content but no live turn, goal, credential, Connection/delegation,
personal grant, Variable Set, Sandbox Environment, MCP server configuration, process, sandbox
identity, pin, or workflow. Destination visibility and acknowledgement are
idempotency-bound.

## Connected accounts

Authenticated messages use the initiating user's eligible connected accounts.
Conversation visibility does not share account access. Queued work, retries and
child work retain the initiating user. No per-conversation connection grant is
required. Multiple eligible accounts require an explicit account choice:

```ts
const accounts = await browserClient.listOwnConnectionAccounts(workspaceId);
// When choosing among multiple accounts, use the exact eligible server/account pair.
const selection = { serverId: "mail", connectionId: accounts[0]!.id };
```

General personal-resource grants for documents, variable sets and other resource
kinds remain available through the root/core SDK. They do not authorize native
connected accounts.

## Workspace credentials, webhooks, and sandbox image

Configure these with an organization key or workspace admin session. Secrets are
returned once; store them when you create the resource. Protocol and payloads:
[`docs/workspace-integrations.md`](../../docs/workspace-integrations.md).

```ts
const { secret: providerSecret } = await client.putWorkspaceCredentialProvider(workspaceId, {
  url: "https://product.example/opengeni/credentials",
});
const { secret: webhookSecret } = await client.createWorkspaceWebhook(workspaceId, {
  url: "https://product.example/opengeni/events",
  eventTypes: ["turn.completed", "turn.failed"],
});

// In your HTTP handlers, verify the raw body before parsing it:
const { event } = await verifyWebhookEvent({ body: rawBody, headers, secret: webhookSecret });
const request = await verifyCredentialProviderRequest({
  body: rawBody,
  headers,
  secret: providerSecret,
});
```

`listWorkspaceSandboxImages` returns the deployment's allowlisted images; set one
with `updateWorkspaceSettings(workspaceId, { defaultSandboxImage })`.

## Personal schedules

A schedule created by an authenticated human or their active agent records that
human as its immutable owner. Only that owner or their verified agent may edit,
run, pause or delete it. Each occurrence resolves the owner's current accounts;
accepted retries retain their original identity and account selection.

```ts
const task = await client.createScheduledTask(workspaceId, {
  name: "Daily triage",
  schedule: { type: "calendar", hour: 8, minute: 0, timeZone: "Europe/Oslo" },
  runMode: "reusable_session",
  agentConfig: { prompt: "Triage the new support issues" },
  connectionAccounts: [selection],
});
```

Account selections narrow eligible accounts; they never transfer ownership.
Omitting `connectionAccounts` on update preserves the selection. Passing an
empty array clears explicit account choices without changing the schedule owner.
Service-owned schedules retain service execution and do not acquire a human's
personal accounts. Run history remains credential-free.

A schedule freezes its connectors, accounts and (when an agent created it)
OpenGeni tools. For the owner, `listScheduledTasks` and `getScheduledTask`
include a read-only `policyDrift` naming what is out of date, and
`listScheduledTaskRuns` includes `accessFailures` for runs that could not use a
connector. `listScheduledTaskAccessAttention` lists schedules whose latest run
failed that way, and schedules that cannot start because a chosen account can no
longer be used (`unavailableAccounts`, with a null `runId`). A signed-in owner
re-freezes with their current access through
`refreshScheduledTaskAccess(workspaceId, taskId, { executionDigest, leaveOut })`,
where the optional `leaveOut` keeps named default connectors or OpenGeni tools
off; API keys and agents cannot. See [`docs/scheduled-task-access.md`](../../docs/scheduled-task-access.md).

Deleting a task is externally idempotent and immediately removes it from live
lists and quota, but the server retains a tombstone plus run/session/turn audit
evidence until workspace/account retention cleanup. A stable `triggerId` is
still required when a caller wants manual-trigger retries to coalesce; ordinary
scheduled fires derive their producer identity from the Temporal fire workflow.

## Realtime browser controller (`@opengeni/sdk/realtime`)

The public realtime subpath owns the provider-neutral browser controller and
the existing Codex Live, WebRTC/V3, and AI Gateway transports. It selects the
transport from the catalog model without changing the backend API, durable
ledger, delegation, context, or recovery semantics:

```ts
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";
import type { SessionRealtimeClientLike } from "@opengeni/sdk/realtime";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: "/opengeni-api" });
const realtimeClient: SessionRealtimeClientLike = client;
const catalog = await realtimeClient.getWorkspaceRealtimeModelCatalog(workspaceId);
const model = catalog.models.find((candidate) => candidate.available)?.id;
if (!model) throw new Error("No realtime model is available");

// Lazy import keeps the base SDK entry safe for server and non-realtime hosts.
const { createSessionRealtimeController } = await import("@opengeni/sdk/realtime");
const controller = createSessionRealtimeController({
  client: realtimeClient,
  workspaceId,
  sessionId,
  model,
  remoteAudio,
});

const unsubscribe = controller.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.status, snapshot.microphone, snapshot.diagnostic);
});
await controller.start();

// Later:
await controller.stop();
unsubscribe();
controller.close();
```

`SessionRealtimeClientLike` is the exact proxy-friendly backend surface:
catalog, begin, Codex/Gateway negotiation, activation, heartbeat, ledger sync,
and end. Existing `OpenGeniClient` methods remain the implementation. Current
Codex-named controller and transport exports remain available as compatibility
aliases, but new integrations should use the provider-neutral names.

Do not put API credentials in browser bundles. Browser hosts should either use
the deployment's normal browser authentication or expose these same methods
through a tenant-scoped, same-origin proxy. The SDK does not move persistence,
prompt construction, context processing, delegation, or provider credentials
out of `apps/api`, `apps/worker`, or `packages/db`.

## Editable artifact sync (`@opengeni/sdk/editable-artifacts`)

Editable-artifact storage, sync, and Worker clients live behind an isolated
subpath; importing the ordinary SDK never loads them. Browser hosts should
bundle the dedicated module-Worker entry and pass its URL plus the exact,
version-matched kernel assets to the client:

```ts
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk/artifacts";
import workerUrl from "@opengeni/sdk/editable-artifacts/worker?worker&url";
import {
  createBrowserEditableArtifactSession,
} from "@opengeni/sdk/editable-artifacts";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL! });
const artifact = await client.getEditableArtifact(workspaceId, artifactId, {
  replicaId,
});
const kernels = {
  spreadsheet: () => import("@opengeni/artifact-kernel-wasm-spreadsheet"),
  document: () => import("@opengeni/artifact-kernel-wasm-document"),
  presentation: () => import("@opengeni/artifact-kernel-wasm-presentation"),
} as const;
const { editableArtifactKernelRuntime } = await kernels[artifact.modality]();
const session = createBrowserEditableArtifactSession({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  workspaceId,
  artifact,
  storageAuthority,
  runtime: {
    workerUrl,
    ...editableArtifactKernelRuntime,
    applicationOrigin: window.location.origin,
  },
});
```

Each kernel package contains only one editor modality, carries a static typed
build/protocol/model/command identity, and is reproduced from smoke-tested Rust
outputs under separate raw and gzip budgets. The Worker verifies that identity
against executable WASM capabilities before accepting state. A self-hosted host
may instead serve the exact version-matched glue and WASM binary together.
Canonical OGASC commands, OGATX intents, OGACO commits, and OGAKQ/OGAKV
queries/projections pass directly through the kernel; there is no JavaScript
operation mapper.

The live transport mints a short-lived, one-use ticket over authenticated HTTP,
then sends that ticket inside the first binary OGALV WebSocket frame. API keys
and long-lived credentials are never placed in the WebSocket URL. Hosts may
inject both `fetch` and the WebSocket factory for authenticated proxies and
tests; negotiated frame and mutation limits are enforced before work is queued.

## Browser and computer interaction (`@opengeni/sdk/interaction`)

An interaction **resource** is a workspace-scoped, durable object with a stable
id and lifecycle, such as a `BrowserSession`, `ComputerSession`, browser
identity, network route, auth run, or pending human intervention. This use of
"resource" is unrelated to the file/repository `resources` attached to a chat
message. A **facade** is only the typed, resource-oriented SDK organization
shown below; it owns no state or authority of its own.

`OpenGeniClient.interaction` is the framework-free resource facade over the same
public BrowserSession, ComputerSession, identity, auth, network-route, and human
intervention APIs used by OpenGeni itself. It adds no second state or execution
path: facade methods call the ordinary typed transport, and every mutation still
uses the canonical generation fences, operation receipt, permission check, and
placement controller.

```ts
const browser = await client.interaction.browsers.currentOrOpen({
  workspaceId,
  associationSessionId: session.id,
  initialUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
});

const { targets } = await browser.tabs.list();
const target = targets.find((candidate) => candidate.selected) ?? targets[0]!;
const page = await browser.observe(target.id);
const screenshot = await browser.screenshot(target.id, { fullPage: true });
// screenshot.data is bounded image bytes; mediaType and dimensions travel with it.

const receipt = await browser.act({
  operationId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  targetId: target.id,
  expectedTargetGeneration: target.targetGeneration,
  expectedDocumentGeneration: target.documentGeneration,
  expectedFrameId: page.frameId,
  action: { type: "click", locator: { kind: "role", role: "button", name: "Continue" } },
});

if (receipt.state === "outcome_unknown") {
  // Do not replay a mutation blindly. Re-observe, then inspect this exact receipt.
  console.log(await browser.receipt(receipt.operationId));
}
```

`browser.targetState(targetId)` reads generation fences without an accessibility
tree. `browser.readDom(targetId, request)` returns a bounded element or count
query using those fences; sensitive values are redacted.

Browser identities are immutable version graphs: live browser state stays
private until `browser.publishRevision(...)` explicitly creates a new revision.
Protected auth fills resolve connection secrets only inside the broker/controller
path; normal SDK reads, observations, diagnostics, receipts, and logs never
return credential values. `client.openWorkspaceInteractionRevisionStream(...)`
is the low-volume latest-wins invalidation stream for keeping resource catalogs
fresh without attaching them to an inference/session event stream.

Use the flat `OpenGeniClient` interaction methods when implementing a proxy or
custom transport. Use `client.interaction` for application logic. Both are the
same API and authority boundary.

## Workspace artifacts

Workspace artifacts are generic, immutable HTML publications. The SDK does not
assign product types such as app, page, dashboard, or gallery. List pages are
bounded and expose both `truncated` and an opaque `nextCursor` so callers never
mistake a partial page for the complete workspace catalog.

Each Site version retains one self-contained executable HTML runtime, its
bounded editable source bundle, and the exact canonical tool identities it
requested. The web host renders that runtime in an opaque-origin sandboxed
iframe. Credentials, cookies, API URLs, workspace ids, and parent DOM authority
never enter the iframe; `@opengeni/sdk/site` uses a single parent-owned
`MessagePort` that exposes only the retained tool allowlist intersected with the
current viewer's live workspace catalog.

```ts
let cursor: string | undefined;
do {
  const page = await client.listWorkspaceArtifacts(workspaceId, {
    limit: 50,
    ...(cursor ? { cursor } : {}),
  });
  for (const artifact of page.artifacts) console.log(artifact.title);
  cursor = page.nextCursor ?? undefined;
} while (cursor);
```

Creation and publication require a caller-supplied idempotency key. Reuse the
same key only to retry the same logical mutation. Agent-authored versions also
return the exact source session, turn, attempt, and execution generation that
published them. Version and event history are bounded; inspect
`versionsTruncated` and `eventsTruncated` on the detail response.

## Workspace tools

The browser-safe SDK exposes the same gateway catalog and executor used by
model MCP calls and Codemode. Generated declarations augment the lazy namespace
for exact installed-tool types; canonical `{ serverId, toolName }` identity and
the server-side catalog remain authoritative.

```ts
const tools = client.tools.forWorkspace(workspaceId);
const documents = await tools.docs.search({ query: "launch plan" });
```

An approval-required call needs a server-issued capability. A trusted host
shows its approval UI first, then asks for one token bound to the current human,
workspace, operation id, catalog digest, exact tool identity, and arguments.
The token expires after five minutes, is stored only as a hash, and is consumed
once by the matching call.

Connection-backed tools configured for both provider policy and one-shot human
approval are omitted from this HTTP catalog until their provider adapter can
preflight credential and resource authorization before consuming the token.

```ts
const operationId = crypto.randomUUID();
const identity = { serverId: "linear", toolName: "issues_update" };
const input = { issueId, state: "Done" };
const approval = await tools.$approve(identity, input, { operationId });

await tools.$call(identity, input, {
  operationId,
  approvalToken: approval.approvalToken,
});
```

When a call or approval request receives the typed
`409 details.code = "catalog_stale"` response, the SDK refreshes the catalog,
re-resolves the exact identity or generated namespace path, preserves the
operation id (generating it before the first attempt when omitted), and retries
once. A call that already carries an approval token cannot reuse that
single-use capability after the catalog digest changes; instead it throws
`OpenGeniToolReapprovalRequiredError` with the refreshed identity and digest so
the trusted host can show approval again for the same operation id.

Reapproval is valid only before the original capability is consumed. Once a
call crosses that boundary, the server retains a hash-only tombstone for the
operation id and rejects another approval with
`409 details.code = "tool_gateway_operation_already_started"` and
`outcomeUnknown: true`. The host must reconcile the provider outcome; it must
not turn an ambiguous call into a second approved execution by minting a fresh
operation id automatically.

Do not request approval capabilities speculatively or expose them to Site iframe
code. The host projects only the active immutable version's requested identities,
supplies the Site context on direct calls, and the server revalidates the active
version and viewer's live authority. The requested set is a maximum allowlist,
not an authority grant; ordinary gateway approval still applies. Archived Sites
receive no tool bridge.

Omit `firstPartyMcpTools` for the complete OpenGeni tool catalog. An explicit
`[]` exposes no broad first-party tools; attached resources and separately
selected `files`/`docs` MCP servers are unaffected.

## MCP tool output normalization

MCP transports and event stores can represent the same tool result as a direct
object, JSON text, a text content block, or nested `result`,
`structuredContent`, and `content` envelopes. Use the shared zero-dependency
normalizer when an embedding host needs one stable interpretation:

```ts
import { normalizeMcpOutput } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const normalized = normalizeMcpOutput(toolOutput);

normalized.value; // canonical machine-readable value
normalized.text; // presentation text
normalized.isError; // preserved across recognized nested envelopes
normalized.raw; // original evidence
```

Malformed text and unknown objects pass through without throwing. Envelope
recognition is deliberately conservative: an ordinary domain object is not
unwrapped merely because it has a field named `result`.

## Error handling

Non-2xx responses throw `OpenGeniApiError` with stable transport metadata:
`status`, optional `code`, `retryable`, optional `correlationId`,
`outcomeUnknown`, and a bounded structured `body`. The SDK sends a fresh bounded
correlation ID on each API request and includes the safe returned reference in
the display message.

```ts
import { OpenGeniApiError } from "@opengeni/sdk";

try {
  await client.sendMessage(workspaceId, sessionId, input);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof OpenGeniApiError && error.outcomeUnknown) {
    // Reconcile durable state, then retry only with input.clientEventId unchanged.
  }
  throw error;
}
```

Error bodies are read only when they are JSON and no larger than 16 KiB; raw
gateway HTML/plain text and oversized bodies are discarded. A controlled typed
API rejection has `outcomeUnknown: false`. A raw `502`/`503`/`504` or an
unexpected successful non-JSON response to a mutation has `outcomeUnknown:
true` because the mutation might already have been accepted. Never turn that
condition into a new operation by changing its idempotency key.

## Streaming guarantees

`client.streamEvents(...)` (and the underlying `streamSessionEvents`) delivers
each session event **exactly once, in order**, anchored on the per-session
contiguous `sequence` number:

- Reconnects transparently on transient drops (network failures, 5xx, 429),
  resuming from the last seen sequence via `?after=`.
- Suppresses duplicates when server replay overlaps what was already seen.
- Backfills any gap observed on a live connection from the durable replay
  endpoint (`GET .../events?after=`) before yielding newer events.
- Ends gracefully when the provided `AbortSignal` aborts; throws on
  non-retryable failures (e.g. 401/403/404).

Use `client.listEventPage(...)` when monitoring another session. A call without
a cursor is safe by default: it returns a newest-first-selected (but
ascending-in-response) semantic tail, uses bounded `summary` payloads, and omits
raw message/reasoning/command/PTY deltas. The page returns exact
`coveredSequence`, `nextBefore`/`nextAfter`, byte, truncation, and projection
metadata. Filters can select canonical event types or the `control`, `terminal`,
`failure`, `checkpoint`, `tool_receipt`, and `provider_account` semantic classes;
`latest` is an exclusive typed lookup that returns the newest event in exactly
the requested class. It cannot be combined with any type or class include/exclude
filter, so an unrelated newer event cannot displace the requested result and an
exclusion cannot remove it.

For callback-loss recovery, `latest` selects authoritative current/legacy rows
by durable session `sequence` across distinct turns; explicit `late_rejected` and
`duplicate` callbacks never compete with current truth. `turnGeneration` remains
metadata and is interpreted only within its turn/retry scope. Use
`resultMode: "compact"` to receive one bounded result-bearing completion,
failure, checkpoint, or receipt without creating another model turn. The
`receipt` spelling aliases `tool_receipt`, and a missing event returns `null`.
The compact result includes exact source/generation/covered-sequence facts and
bounded text/output/result/failure/checkpoint/receipt values. Retained-output
storage and full-evidence retrieval are separate contracts from this event
projection.

```ts
const terminal = await client.listEventPage(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  latest: "terminal",
  payloadMode: "summary",
});

const recovered = await client.getLatestEventResult(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  latest: "terminal",
});

const older = await client.listEventPage(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  before: terminal.nextBefore ?? undefined,
  includeClasses: ["failure", "checkpoint"],
  payloadMode: "none",
});
```

Use explicit `mode: "forensic", payloadMode: "full"` with `after`/`before` for
exact retained audit replay. “Full” means the exact durable audit projection;
it cannot restore source bytes that the audit boundary never retained. REST/SDK
pages remain count- and byte-bounded, so continue with the returned cursor. The
convenience `client.listEvents(...)` returns only the page's event array. Pass
`compact: true` for forensic history windows that do not need individual delta
fragments; delta runs may be coalesced and expose `payload.coalescedUntil` as
the true last sequence for stream resume cursors.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
for await (const event of client.streamEvents(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  after: lastSeenSequence,
  signal: controller.signal,
  onStateChange: (state) => console.log("stream:", state),
})) {
  // ...
}
```

## Messages, the turn queue, and steering

Messages sent while a turn is running **queue by default** — visible,
editable, reorderable, and deletable until the worker claims them. Steering is
the explicit alternative: deliver now by interrupting the running turn.

```ts
// Queue (default): stacks behind the running turn.
await client.sendMessage(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  text: "Also check the nginx config",
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
});

// Steer: send + promote to the queue front + interrupt the running turn.
await client.steerMessage(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  text: "Stop — prod is paging, look at that first",
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
});

// Manage the server-authoritative queue while it waits.
const queue = await client.getQueue(workspaceId, sessionId);
const waiting = queue.items.at(-1)!;
await client.moveQueueItem(workspaceId, sessionId, waiting.id, {
  expectedQueueVersion: queue.version,
  beforeTurnId: queue.items[0]?.id ?? null,
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
});
await client.editQueueItem(workspaceId, sessionId, waiting.id, {
  expectedTurnVersion: waiting.version,
  expectedDraftRevision: 0,
  replaceDraft: false,
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
});

// Pause/Resume is recursive workstream control; it creates no queue row.
await client.pauseSession(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  reason: "hold this workstream",
  expectedControlEtag: queue.effectiveControl.controlEtag,
});
const paused = await client.getQueue(workspaceId, sessionId);
await client.resumeSession(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  expectedControlEtag: paused.effectiveControl.controlEtag,
});
// Cancel is irreversible: it drains and fences this session subtree.
await client.cancelSession(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  reason: "host record deleted",
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
});
await client.sendApprovalDecision(workspaceId, sessionId, { approvalId, decision: "approve" });
```

## Retry a failed session without changing its intent

Try again is separate from Pause/Resume and `sendMessage`. Retain the request
across an ambiguous transport response; never synthesize a continuation prompt:

```ts
const retryRequest = {
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  failureEventId, // the current durable turn.failed event id
  model: selectedModel,
  reasoningEffort: "high" as const,
  latencyMode: "standard" as const,
};
const retry = await client.retrySession(workspaceId, sessionId, retryRequest);
// { outcome: "accepted" | "replayed", turnId, failureEventId }
```

Requires `sessions:control` and session access. Recovery keeps the logical turn,
original question, frozen authority, and completed history/tool results; it
does not create a user message. Omitted policy fields retain the failed turn's
selection. The selected policy is revalidated for new admission. A duplicate
operation replays its receipt even after execution advances.

HTTP 409 codes distinguish `RETRY_STALE_FAILURE`, `RETRY_EXECUTION_UNRESOLVED`,
`RETRY_PAUSED`, `RETRY_UNSUPPORTED_FAILURE`, and `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`.
Unresolved tool outcomes cannot be blindly replayed. A deliberate Pause must
be resumed separately. Failure without a retained logical turn, a settled
scheduled occurrence, and idle credit exhaustion are not supported retry
boundaries. See [run lifecycle](../../docs/run-lifecycle.md).

## Session tool policy and native web search

For standalone credential maintenance, use the dedicated operation rather than
sending a message:

```ts
const request = {
  operationKey: crypto.randomUUID(),
  updates: [{
    id: "crm",
    expectedCredentialVersion: 1,
    expectedServerUrl: "https://tools.example.test/mcp",
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${replacementToken}` },
  }],
};
const receipt = await client.rotateSessionMcpCredentials(workspaceId, sessionId, request);
```

Only exact existing inline servers without `connectionRef` are eligible. Both
session control and MCP attach permissions, live session authorization, expected
versions, and a quiescent credential-consumer boundary are required. This never
sends a message, starts work, retries a failed turn, or refreshes an active
client. Reconcile an ambiguous response with the same request/key; the SDK does
not retry mutations automatically. Exact authorized replay returns the original
receipt without a second write. Old receipt verification fails explicitly with
503 if the deployment encryption key has been replaced. See the full
[rotation contract](../../docs/session-mcp-servers.md#standalone-inline-credential-rotation).

Omitting `tools` when creating a top-level session selects the current
workspace-default capability policy, including the built-in `files` server.
Passing `tools`, including `[]`, is an intentional fixed narrowing and can
therefore disable file-download access for that session. OpenGeni's own web UI
keeps `files` enabled as a hidden default, while API and embedded clients retain
exact control over the explicit list. Supported Responses providers attach
their native bounded web-search tool independently of this MCP policy.

Existing explicit sessions are not widened when a new default capability is
introduced. Opt one in explicitly with the current optimistic-concurrency
version; the audited change takes effect on its next attempt:

```ts
const session = await client.getSession(workspaceId, sessionId);
const updated = await client.updateSessionToolPolicy(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  mode: "workspace_default",
  expectedVersion: session.toolPolicyVersion,
});
```

To keep a fixed allow-list, replace both connected MCP servers and individual
OpenGeni tools atomically:

```ts
await client.updateSessionToolPolicy(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  mode: "explicit",
  tools,
  firstPartyMcpTools,
  expectedVersion: session.toolPolicyVersion,
});
```

Follow-up Send and Steer requests inherit this session policy and cannot carry
a private one-turn tool override. `tool_search` discovers deferred MCP schemas;
it is not public web search.

## Goals

```ts
const goal = await client.getGoal(workspaceId, sessionId); // counters: autoContinuations, noProgressStreak
await client.pauseGoal(workspaceId, sessionId, { rationale: "manual review" });
await client.resumeGoal(workspaceId, sessionId); // resets counters, re-arms continuations

const revisions = await client.listGoalRevisions(workspaceId, sessionId); // legacy raw array
const page = await client.listGoalRevisionPage(workspaceId, sessionId, { limit: 25 });
await client.rejectGoalRevision(workspaceId, sessionId, proposalId, {
  expectedObjectiveRevision: goal.objectiveRevision,
  rationale: "Keep the existing objective",
});
await client.rollbackGoalRevision(workspaceId, sessionId, appliedRevisionId, {
  expectedObjectiveRevision: goal.objectiveRevision,
  rationale: "Restore the last known-good objective",
});
```

## Files

`uploadFile` wraps the three-step flow (begin → signed PUT → complete) in one
call; the lower-level steps are exported for resumable/custom flows.

Browser hosts need no storage credentials or per-application registration.
OpenGeni authorizes the workspace request and returns a short-lived,
object-scoped signed URL; operators must configure the private object store to
allow CORS from `*` so any product embedding the SDK can use that URL.

```ts
const file = await client.uploadFile(workspaceId, {
  filename: "incident-notes.md",
  contentType: "text/markdown",
  data: notes, // string | Blob | ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array
});
const { url } = await client.createFileDownloadUrl(workspaceId, file.id);
```

Generated-image tool results use the same workspace file authority but expose a
closed `generated_image` receipt. Prefer a short-lived zero-copy browser URL;
use the bounded range method when the caller needs verified bytes:

```ts
const { url } = await client.createRetainedArtifactDownloadUrl(workspaceId, receipt.artifact);
const { bytes } = await client.downloadRetainedArtifact(workspaceId, receipt.artifact);
```

Both methods validate the receipt first. The byte path additionally verifies
the assembled SHA-256. See `docs/image-generation.md` in the repository.

## Connected Machines (bring-your-own-compute)

A session can run on an enrolled **Connected Machine** — a user's own computer —
instead of a platform-managed sandbox. Two `createSession` fields target one:

- **`targetSandboxId`** (uuid) — the machine to run on (a `MachineView.sandboxId`
  from `listMachines`). It seeds the session's active-sandbox pointer at
  creation, so the first turn lands on that machine.
- **`workingDir`** (host path) — the directory the agent runs under on that
  machine. **Only valid together with `targetSandboxId`** — `workingDir` alone is
  a **422**. Omit it and the session runs under the machine's default workspace
  root. Repos attached to a machine session are **not cloned** (the machine uses
  its own git auth).

```ts
const { machines } = await client.listMachines(workspaceId);
const box = machines.find((m) => m.kind === "selfhosted" && m.state === "online");

const session = await client.createSession(workspaceId, {
  initialMessage: "Run the test suite and fix what's red",
  targetSandboxId: box!.sandboxId, // seeds the active-sandbox pointer at create
  workingDir: "/home/me/projects/app", // requires targetSandboxId, else 422
});

// Re-point a running session's active sandbox (or "session"/"default" to swap
// back to its own managed box):
await client.swapActiveSandbox(workspaceId, session.id, { target: box!.sandboxId });
```

Discovery (`listMachines`, `machineMetricsSeries`), the active-sandbox swap, and
the enrollment methods (`mintEnrollToken`, `lookupDeviceEnrollment`,
`approveDeviceEnrollment`, `denyDeviceEnrollment`) are covered in the
[Connected Machines guide](../../docs/connected-machines.md).

For large agent hierarchies, use `listAgentTopology` instead of collecting full
session pages. It returns compact root, direct-child, or server-side search
pages with opaque cursors and server-authored descendant counts. Load a child
page only when its parent is expanded; `children.truncated` makes a lower-bound
aggregate explicit.

`listIntegrationDefinitions` returns safe Integration Definition metadata without any
deployment OAuth client credentials. API Integrations are multi-instance:
`installApiIntegration` may supply a
stable `instanceKey`, display name, and exact Connection. The returned
`serverId` is instance-specific, so two Gmail or Linear accounts can be
selected in one session without tool-name collision. Uninstall preview and
uninstall both require the exact `instanceKey` and instance version; neither
operation disconnects the underlying Connection.

Adapter-owned Integration facets are listed and mutated under the exact
`capabilityId` + `instanceKey` + `facetKey`. Generic primitive schemas use
`configureIntegrationFacet`; lifecycle changes and removal require the
binding's exact optimistic version plus a caller UUID idempotency key. Google
Drive's nested folder/Shared Drive source schema has dedicated
`browseGoogleDriveFacetSource` and `saveGoogleDriveFacetSource`
methods. They verify provider metadata through that instance's exact Connection
and persist only a versioned facet binding—never provider credentials, page
tokens, or selected-source configuration on the Connection.

### Protocol routes (deliberately not in the SDK)

Some endpoints are wire protocols for specific counterparts, not client
surface, and are intentionally absent from the SDK: machine-agent enrollment
device flow and NATS auth-callout, viewer/stream internals beyond minting,
OAuth/GitHub browser callbacks, Stripe webhooks, the MCP transports themselves
(`/v1/workspaces/:id/mcp`, `/mcp/docs` — speak MCP to those), and the install
script routes. If you find yourself calling one of these raw from a product,
reconsider — they can change with their counterpart, not with the SDK.

## Compatibility

Clients and servers are compatible within the same **major** version of this
SDK; evolution is additive within a major and both sides are tolerant readers.
Official server builds expose `serverVersion` on `/healthz` and
`/v1/config/client`. A route scheduled for removal answers with `Deprecation`
and `Sunset` headers at least 90 days (and a major) ahead; the client reports
each deprecated route once through the `onDeprecation` option (default: one
`console.warn` per route; `false` silences it). Full policy:
`docs/design/api-compatibility-policy.md`.

## Proxy through your own API

For the React conversation, use the packaged
[`createSessionProxyHandler`](#embed-the-conversation-default). For a custom
backend route, keep your organization API key on your server and re-emit the
stream to your own browser clients. The re-emitted wire format is identical to OpenGeni's SSE
stream, so the browser side can consume it with this same SDK (or a plain
`EventSource`), including resume via `?after=` / `Last-Event-ID`:

```ts
// Your server (Hono, Next.js route handler, Bun.serve, workers, ...):
import { OpenGeniClient, proxySessionEventStream } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENGENI_API_KEY!,
});

export function GET(request: Request): Response {
  // authenticate *your* user, resolve their session id, then:
  return proxySessionEventStream(client, workspaceId, sessionId, {
    after: request, // honors ?after= and Last-Event-ID from the browser
    signal: request.signal, // browser disconnect tears down the upstream stream
  });
}
```

For custom layers, the pieces are exported individually:
`sessionEventsToSseStream`, `sessionEventsToSseResponse`, `formatSseEvent`,
`resumeSequenceFromRequest`, and `parseSseStream`.

## Types

The SDK ships hand-written mirrors of the public wire shapes (sessions, turns,
events, resource/tool refs) so it carries no runtime dependency on the server
packages. `test/contract-parity.test.ts` pins them to `@opengeni/contracts`,
so contract drift fails the repo gate instead of shipping. `SessionEvent.type`
is an open union: unknown event types from newer servers flow through instead
of breaking older SDK consumers.

Hosts, test doubles, and same-origin proxies must import
`OPENGENI_API_CONTRACT_REVISION` from `@opengeni/sdk` when constructing a client
configuration or contract header. Do not copy its string value: the revision is
an executable compatibility boundary, and `getClientConfig()` intentionally
fails closed when server and SDK revisions differ.
