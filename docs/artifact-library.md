# Artifact library

The workspace **Artifacts** page and the session's Artifacts panel are views of
the same durable outputs. Sites are one artifact type, alongside documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, images, and published files. Existing Site and
editable-artifact detail links keep their meaning.

## Discovery, not another content store

`GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/artifact-catalog` projects existing domains into
bounded `ArtifactCatalogItem` summaries. `client.listArtifactCatalog(workspaceId,
options)` is the corresponding SDK entry point. It supports title search (`q`),
`kind`, `status`, `sort` (`updated`, `newest`, or `title`), `limit`, an opaque
`cursor`, and optional `sourceSessionId` filtering. Clients use `nextCursor`, not
offsets or scans of conversation history. Use `kind:id` as the list identity;
native artifact IDs are not replaced by catalog IDs.

Pagination is a live keyset traversal, not a transaction snapshot spanning HTTP
requests. Its initial timestamp excludes later creations; titles and update
times can still change between pages. An edited item may move across the cursor
and appear again or only after a refresh. Clients deduplicate by `kind:id` and
restart the listing when refreshing or changing filters. The cursor is scoped to
the viewer and query and expires after one hour. A bounded scan through denied
candidates can return an empty page with `nextCursor`; that is not the end of the
listing.

The web console keeps loaded catalog views in memory per client, credential
generation, workspace, and filters, so switching tabs or returning to the page
renders at once. A view older than 30 seconds, or one a session's tool output has
marked stale, refetches on revisit or window focus, restarting the listing and
reloading as many pages as were shown. Site archive, restore, and rollback drop
the workspace's cached views; an access denial drops them without keeping rows.

The catalog reuses Site records and versions, editable-artifact records and
authority, generated-image correlation, and explicit sandbox-file publication
metadata. File bytes remain in the existing workspace file domain. It does not
index every uploaded attachment, working file, browser screenshot, or temporary
build output. Publishing an output is deliberate; creating a file in a sandbox
alone does not publish it.

Discovery does not authorize content access or change an editable artifact's
session associations. Existing file and artifact read permissions remain
authoritative. Source-session links are exposed only when that session is
readable. Content is loaded through the existing authenticated artifact APIs;
catalog results contain no storage credentials or temporary download URLs.

## Presentation and version semantics

The workspace library opens as a preview gallery: cards with a thumbnail, the
title and one meta line ("Site · updated 3 days ago"), the ⋯ menu on hover or
focus. Images show their own pixels; a Site shows a still of its published
HTML (`getWorkspaceArtifactHtml`) in a `srcdoc` frame with an empty `sandbox`
and a `default-src 'none'` policy, so a card never runs Site code or makes a
network request. Other types show their type glyph (and a file's extension).
Previews load only near the viewport. A Gallery | List toggle in the toolbar
switches to flat rows and is remembered in the browser
(`opengeni:artifact-library:view:v1`). Both views keep the type tabs, title
search, and a Filter menu for archived items and sorting. The session panel
uses the same catalog with a source-session filter. Both open the existing
type-specific viewers. Published files use `/workspaces/:workspaceId/artifacts/files/:artifactId`.

Images load from retained storage, not the compute filesystem. Image publication
results are primary chat output and reuse the retained-image viewer/lightbox.
Agents should still include `![Description](artifact:<artifactId>)` in their
answer when presenting an image. The reference pins the published bytes: changing
or deleting the source file does not change the delivered image. Repeating the
same sandbox path/content publication reuses its identity; changed bytes produce
a distinct immutable output.

`sandbox_file_publish` reads from the active session filesystem, not a fixed
managed-sandbox alias. Pass a workspace-relative file path or an absolute path
inside the resolved root: `/workspace` on managed sandboxes, or the actual
host-native root on a Connected Machine (including Windows drive/UNC roots).
The receipt preserves that canonical source path. Publication does not expand
filesystem authority; traversal and paths outside the active root are rejected.
Existing managed-sandbox publication identities remain unchanged. Older clients
whose receipt validator assumes `/workspace` need the matching contract update
to recognize native-path receipts.

Published-file links use `[Open file](artifact:<artifactId>)`; the console resolves
them to the authenticated file page and opens the session artifact panel. Inline
`![Preview](artifact:<artifactId>)` selects image, video, audio or PDF presentation
from retained metadata. Other formats show file details/download through the same
artifact link. HTML files remain non-executable. Source navigation continues to
use `sandbox:` and the workspace inspector; it does not publish a file.

The console permits validated `fromSession` return context when opening canonical
artifact links in the panel. Version-specific, foreign-workspace and unknown
query parameters keep their full-page behavior. Embedded `SessionConversation`
hosts can supply `renderMessageText` with `Markdown.artifactHref` and `renderImage`
to connect their own navigation and media surfaces.

New MP4/WebM/OGV and MP3/M4A/OGG/WAV/FLAC sandbox publications carry media MIME
types under a separate media identity namespace. Older binary-typed publications
retain their original metadata and remain downloadable. The retained-file panel and inline chat
also preview these older audio/video files using their saved media filename;
it passes the original receipt to the authorized playback path unchanged.
Inline chat retrieves filename metadata only for generic binary files, checks
workspace and artifact identity, and never infers media from the message label.
Existing non-media publication identities and receipts are unchanged.

Image classification follows the retained file's authoritative content type.
This rolling change preserves the sandbox publisher's existing PNG/JPEG/WebP
format mapping. GIF, AVIF, and SVG are viewable when already retained with a
supported image content type, but binary-typed sandbox publications remain files.
The catalog does not infer a different media type from a filename or rewrite an
immutable publication's metadata.

Library browsing must not execute Site JavaScript, invoke workspace tools, or wake
compute. Images have real image previews. Types without an available static
preview use a clearly identified type/title fallback; those tiles are not
screenshots of the artifact. Existing editable viewers open the current head;
saved Site chat embeds can select an exact version.

Ordinary HTML files remain downloadable files, not executable Site previews.
The existing explicit `opengeni-html` and `opengeni-site` chat blocks continue
through the shared isolated HTML frame and tool bridge. Message-owned inline
HTML is not automatically copied into the library. Publish a Site when that
visualization needs independent discovery and a durable version lifecycle.

Chat previews reserve their display space before loading. Retained chat images
and executable HTML/Site previews start loading near the visible timeline, not
for every offscreen message in the loaded history window. Once activated, they
stay mounted while scrolling so interactive state is preserved. A manual Load
action remains available, and browsers without intersection observation load
normally. Site and inline-HTML chat viewports have bounded fixed heights; larger
content scrolls inside the preview or opens with the full-screen control. Late
content resize messages do not resize the conversation. Loading, failure, and
retry states retain the same chat slot. The Artifacts image detail viewer uses
the available page width and a viewport-height limit instead of the fixed chat
image slot, while preserving the image aspect ratio and expand action.

## Serving user content from the API origin

Every API response that streams user- or agent-controlled bytes (retained
file/image/video and screenshot `/content` ranges, browser and computer frames,
editable-artifact export downloads, and the Company Brain and workspace-state
exports) uses the shared headers in `apps/api/src/http/user-content.ts`:

- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; ...; sandbox`, so a directly
  opened file is a sandboxed document with no script, form, popup, or network
  capability. Audio and video use `sandbox allow-same-origin` (never
  `allow-scripts`) so the browser's media player can re-fetch its own URL.
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- `Content-Disposition: attachment` only for active markup types (HTML, XML
  dialects including SVG, multipart), so opening one downloads it instead of
  rendering attacker-authored markup on the app origin. Images, media, PDF and
  text stay inline (a directly opened PDF still renders in Chrome's viewer
  under the bare `sandbox` policy). The filename carries an ASCII fallback plus
  an RFC 6266 `filename*` for names the fallback would change.

The console never navigates to these routes; its previews read bytes through
the SDK and render them in app-owned elements, so the headers do not change
in-app viewing. Site `/html` responses keep their own `sandbox allow-scripts`
policy (an opaque origin), add the same CORP and `nosniff` headers, and are
attachments: clients fetch the HTML and render it in their own frame, so a raw
`/html` URL never runs a publisher page at an app-origin URL. A new route that
returns stored bytes must use the same helper;
`apps/api/test/user-content-headers.test.ts` fails until a new raw route body is
classified.

Signed object-storage GET URLs follow the same rule through
`userContentSignedGetUrlOptions`: for active markup (file and document
downloads, Knowledge originals, the files MCP, and Site HTML downloads) the URL
carries a signed `Content-Disposition: attachment` response override
(`response-content-disposition` on S3-compatible and GCS, `rscd` on Azure).
The storage endpoint is not always a separate site: local development serves
Garage from loopback, and a preview may route the bucket path on the app
origin. URLs that only a machine fetches (browser-controller file authorities,
workspace capture manifests and files stored as JSON or octet-stream) are
unchanged.

## Boundaries and compatibility

- No new image storage provider or second HTML execution path.
- No migration of editable content into a universal artifact table.
- No change to existing Site, editable-artifact, or retained-content API URLs.
- Historical unassociated sandbox files are not recovered by parsing storage
  keys or replaying tool history. Republishing a still-available source file
  establishes its publication metadata.
- Retained content retrieval failures remain explicit; the UI does not silently
  fall back to starting a sandbox.
