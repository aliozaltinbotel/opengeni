# Run lifecycle: turns, goals, and memory

This is the orientation for how an OpenGeni agent run actually executes over
time. It ties together three subsystems a contributor touching the session
workflow, the worker activity, or the runtime must keep straight. Code wins
over this doc; the canonical sources are `apps/worker/src/workflows/session.ts`,
`apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/` (orchestrator `run.ts`), `packages/runtime/src/index.ts`,
`packages/runtime/src/model-input.ts`, and `packages/runtime/src/run-events.ts`.

## Turns

Workspace control revisions never move backwards. Migration 0505 repairs heads
behind retained control events by advancing only the revision, preserving pause
state, timers and event history. Fresh browser streams start at that head; old
pause/resume events must not replay as current UI invalidations on every load.

Externally owned SDK history preserves retained messages across opaque compaction
checkpoints in both provider input and returned history. The turn history sink
checks the identities and order of its durable prefix before advancing its append
cursor; database position conflicts succeed only for the same turn and exact
canonical item. Provider dispatch and successful settlement require this check.

A **turn** is one logical unit of agent work inside a session: a waiting
human/API prompt, an approval or structured-input response, or one coalesced
internal-update batch is processed until the agent reaches a natural stopping
point. Human/API prompts remain the only reorderable prompt rows. The same
compact queue surface also projects canonical pending machine inputs, attached
to the prompt they will join or grouped as standalone incoming updates. Goals,
child results, and lifecycle notices remain internal machine inputs. A pure
scheduled-occurrence batch that creates a standalone scheduler-owned turn is
the deliberate model-facing exception: its durable history item uses the `user`
role so the model receives a fresh task boundary, with exact task/run/update ids
and an instruction to refresh mutable external state. A scheduled occurrence
attached to an existing human/API turn remains system-role context. The fresh
task boundary never impersonates a human in backend authority: the turn
initiator remains the scheduler service and its frozen causal-human,
personal-connection, provider-account, audit, and settlement facts remain
unchanged. Codex capacity recovery preserves the current logical turn directly
and is neither a queue row nor an internal update. One execution attempt runs as
one non-retryable Temporal `runAgentTurn` activity. Inside the activity the
OpenAI Agents SDK loop makes as many model calls and tool calls as the work
needs.

After execution ends, every physical finalization stage has a five-minute
containment deadline, including normally completed turns. This is not a
run-length limit. Heartbeats report `finalizing` and the current bounded
`finalizationStage`; Grafana exposes stage occupancy and thirty-second slow-stage observations;
the bounded containment log and worker restarts identify actual exits.
A stuck writer drain is never detached to release a successor: the worker exits,
and normal heartbeat recovery and durable retained-process proofs govern
admission. The deadline resets only when cleanup advances to another stage and
is disarmed when the finalizer exits, including exceptional exits. Publishing a
quiescence receipt does not disable containment for later housekeeping.
Closed attempts with unsettled workspace mutations or active, unadopted retained
processes also block admission, even when their logical outcome is `completed`.
The work peeker exposes the existing previous-attempt wait, and the final writer's
settlement re-arms the workflow wake. Independently adopted background commands
retain their own lifetime and do not hold this turn-cleanup gate.

A resumed attempt may attach another atomic internal-update batch to the same
logical turn after its resolved open suffix. Each delivered update retains its
own batch's durable history-item receipt; a turn-wide update query can therefore
span multiple batches. Model input reads those batches from canonical history
in position order, never reconstructs them from update rows, and never requires
one shared history-item id across the whole turn.

Provider safety refusals terminate the turn with `provider_safety_refusal` and
the original diagnostic. They are neither temporary provider unavailability
nor credential failures, even when carried by a 5xx response. Same-turn recovery
and account rotation must not replay them.

Session display titles are durable session metadata, not a truncation of model
history. Creation and migration use `New conversation` only as the durable
marker that semantic naming is still pending. Human-facing clients render a
short, sensitive-safe opening-prompt preview while that marker (or a legacy null
title) remains. Unsafe leading lines are skipped, so a pasted URL followed by a
normal request still gets a useful immediate label; if no safe prompt line
exists, a short session reference keeps rows distinguishable without exposing
prompt bytes. The preview/reference is display-only, never persisted or searched
as title metadata, and the client naturally yields when `session.title_set`
arrives.

The first-party `session_create` tool is the bounded exception for an
agent-created child: the manager may provide a concise semantic title, and an
omission derives one from the delegated goal or initial message through the same
sensitive-safe automatic-title normalizer. The title row mutation and
`session.title_set` event commit in the child's atomic initial-state transaction,
before its first turn can wake. Public REST/SDK creation does not gain a title
field, and a human title still wins over every automatic write. If every child
candidate is rejected as sensitive or unsuitable, the ordinary pending marker
and first-turn self-heal path remain.

While a session still has the pending marker, and its exact selected first-party
tool and permission policy permits `set_session_title`, the production runtime
removes that operation from the model-visible catalog for the attempt and starts
one bounded, tool-less title request beside the ordinary response stream. The
sidecar uses the same resolved provider and credential authority, receives only
a bounded conversation opener, and is metered as its own model call. The main
agent does not wait for a title tool result or make a title follow-up model call.
When the main stream reaches normal settlement, the worker waits for the
already-running bounded sidecar and joins it without cancelling. Exceptional or
cancelled exits abort and join any still-pending sidecar. A completed candidate
then uses the canonical title mutation, which updates the session row and
appends `session.title_set`. Generation or persistence failure leaves the safe
pending marker in place, and a human title remains protected from every later
automatic write. Historical fallback sessions therefore self-heal on their
next eligible model turn.

`OpenGeniRuntime.generateSessionTitle` is a rolling-compatible optional seam.
Older or custom runtimes that do not implement it retain the prior attempt-local
`set_session_title` tool plus one-shot model instruction, so an embedding host
does not silently lose automatic naming during an upgrade. That compatibility
path remains serialized; the production runtime takes the parallel path.

Ordinary Send acknowledges locally before transport completion. The composer
freezes the exact text, annotations, resources, settings, and one
`clientEventId`, clears the visible draft immediately, and renders that snapshot
directly in chat when admitted toward execution, in the prompt queue when it
must wait behind work, or as `Not sent` after a definite rejection. Rapid
distinct sends keep distinct keys and preserve order: while the first admission
is unsettled, the next Send is provisionally placed in the queue and never
bounces between surfaces. An outcome-unknown retry first reconciles and reuses
the same key; a definite rejection retry receives a fresh key. Newer edits are
a separate draft shadow and survive the in-flight operation and remount. The
optimistic row disappears when the authoritative `user.message` arrives, so
HTTP-first, SSE-first, reconnect, and remount paths cannot create duplicate
visible messages.

The outside and inside composers are separate authorities. Before a session
exists, `new_session_drafts` owns the next session. Inside a session,
`composer_drafts` owns the next message for that actor/session; navigation and
workspace defaults do not copy policy between them. Send/Steer submits one exact
inside draft revision and the server rotates that row to a blank next revision
in the same transaction that freezes the queued turn. Every queued turn therefore
retains its own text, resources, model, reasoning, and latency. Editing a queued
turn checks that exact snapshot back into the inside composer atomically, and a
nonempty composer is replaced only after explicit confirmation. An independent
session fork copies the source session's exact typed reasoning and latency; it
does not invent defaults or consult either composer.

Session detail/list and Insights model labels project the newest turn with a
durable `turn.started` event. Fresh actor drafts, omitted follow-up fields, voice
delegations and voice-end handoffs inherit that same model, reasoning and latency
policy through `packages/db/src/session-execution-policy.ts`. Creation settings
are used only before any turn starts. Existing drafts and accepted queued turns
keep their explicit settings; a rejected admission never changes inheritance.
The stored session creation fields are not rewritten. Scheduled generated-session
recovery validates those stored fields, not the public latest-turn projection. API admission freezes its
resolved policy so billing validation and the accepted turn cannot disagree if
another turn starts before the prompt transaction commits. A removed or blocked
inherited model requires a new selection, never a silent switch to the original.

On the server, prompt acceptance remains one canonical Postgres transaction:
the user event, physically queued turn, immutable admission routing,
session/queue state, optional realtime mirror, audit receipt,
`agent_run.created` usage fact, and workflow-wake outbox revision commit
together. The response is built from those returned committed rows.
NATS and workspace-control fanout plus the immediate Temporal wake attempt are
scheduled only after commit and are not response-holding; durable event replay
and the wake outbox recover their failures.

One narrow Send exception prevents a conversational answer from getting stuck
behind the question it is answering. When the active, unpaused branch is in
`requires_action`, a normal human Send is promoted inside that same transaction
to Steer-equivalent replacement: pending human-input or approval state is
cancelled, the new prompt is inserted at the head, and its routing is
`accepted_for_steering`. Running, recovering, and capacity-waiting turns retain
ordinary Send queue semantics. An explicitly paused branch also remains inert;
only Resume or an explicit Steer activates it. Resubmitting a checked-out queue
Edit also keeps ordinary queue placement: it is a revision of already accepted
work, not a new conversational answer to the active wait.

An owner-authored `personalResourceAttachment` is part of that same accepted
work transaction for create, Send, and Steer. The server derives the fixed
personal Variable Set/Sandbox Environment/selected Connected Machine closure from the locked session; callers never issue
a grant and then send work in a second operation. `once` is consumed against
the logical turn id, so every recovery attempt for that turn copies the same
immutable snapshot. It is never copied to a queue edit, goal continuation, or
machine-input successor; editing a queued once-bearing turn is rejected.
`session` and `always` remain live grant generations for later causal turns.
Revocation cannot erase bytes already injected into a running sandbox, but it
rejects every later resolution and recovery admission. Realtime session staging
does not accept this intent because it has no initial logical-turn boundary.

The same ordinary session can add and remove a realtime voice
conversational transport without creating a second session, queue, or workflow.
Only the authenticated browser owner/connection is exclusive. Human
composer/queue/Send/Steer, ordinary turns, recovery, compaction, goals, and
maintenance continue through their existing transactions and worker claims
while voice is active. Realtime and ordinary mutations still serialize on the
canonical PostgreSQL locks, but neither becomes an admission fence for the
other. Ending or expiring the owner commits `session.realtime.ended`; an expired
lease is also cleaned up lazily during a normal claim. The lifecycle is
canonical in
`packages/db/src/session-realtime.ts`, `packages/db/src/index.ts`, and
`apps/worker/src/workflows/session.ts`.

The ordinary web session composes this durable mode through one lifecycle
controller and a selected provider transport. Connected Codex keeps its native
WebRTC/V3 transport unchanged. AI Gateway models mint a single-use short-lived
browser token, connect through Gateway's normalized realtime WebSocket, and
translate only at the edge into the same pinned V3 bridge. Both therefore share
the same owner, connection epochs, ledger, context projection, delegation/Steer,
tail handoff, heartbeat, rotation, and recovery semantics. The already-mounted composer, Send/Steer,
model/reasoning/tool configuration, and queue mutations remain available while
voice is active. Its only persistent surface is a split voice action beside
Send: the primary click starts or ends the call, while the disclosure holds the
supported realtime-model choice, connection status, recovery actions, and dev
diagnostics. Realtime-model choice is intentionally independent from the
ordinary session model and remembers the user's last workspace choice. The
catalog groups OpenGeni-managed Gateway, Connected Codex, and workspace-owned
Gateway models; unconfigured credentials remain visible but disabled.
The owner operation and browser proof are
scoped to session storage and never rendered or logged. Reload replays that
same operation and rotates only the dead browser connection. Without matching
proof, the surface truthfully remains lost-owner until an end/expiry event;
there is no status API or newly invented logical mode. Canonical:
`packages/sdk/src/codex-realtime-controller.ts`,
`packages/sdk/src/gateway-realtime-transport.ts`,
`packages/react/src/realtime/realtime-control.tsx`, and
`apps/web/src/routes/session.tsx`.

Finite provider calls are hidden behind connection generations, not new
realtime modes. On OpenGeni's configured conservative proactive-rotation interval, or after a dead or
disconnected peer, the controller reuses a healthy microphone stream and
negotiates one replacement beside the active connection. PostgreSQL permits
exactly one `active` connection and one `negotiating`/`ready` replacement for a
mode. The browser activates the replacement only after its data channel opens;
that transaction advances the connection epoch, retires the old row, and keeps
the same realtime id, owner, lifecycle, and durable V3 ledger. During rolling
deployment, clients that omit the new browser-activation marker retain the old
immediate-activation behavior; hardened clients always require the two-phase
proof. Startup replay and OpenGeni client-delivery ACKs remain bound to the promoted connection,
and browser generation fences make late answers, duplicate callbacks, and old
peer events inert. Failed preparation leaves the old healthy peer active;
recovery uses bounded backoff and terminal conflicts permanently stop its retry
loop. Stop, reload without owner proof, and concurrent timer/network failure
all abort pending negotiation and release peers, timers, media, and playback.
The same-browser owner record also carries a versioned, bounded delegation
replay journal. A delegation snapshot is written before it enters the bridge
queue; successful sync advances the journal from the exact pending entry to its
accepted item identity before in-memory acknowledgement. Reload recovery
requeues pending snapshots without rereading host context and suppresses
accepted provider duplicates. Malformed, normalization-changing, oversized,
over-count, or unwritable journal state fails closed and stops that connection
generation instead of mutating or dropping durable work; terminal mode
settlement removes the owner record and journal together.
The browser installs a raw listener synchronously when `oai-events` is created,
before any asynchronous negotiation. Its activation FIFO excludes audio deltas,
rejects malformed or over-1-MiB events, and is hard-bounded to 256 entries and
16 MiB; crossing either bound aborts that generation instead of dropping and
continuing. Negotiation plus channel-open has one abortable 20-second deadline
under the 30-second mode lease. Activation drains the early FIFO and swaps to
the direct bridge listener synchronously, with no await gap or duplicate.

Microphone and audible output are separate truthful states. Permission denial,
missing device, acquisition failure, and an ended track have deterministic
non-secret codes; a lost track is reacquired before recovery can claim input is
healthy. Remote playback never disables or serializes microphone input, so
native full-duplex GPT-Live barge-in remains provider-controlled. If browser
autoplay rejects `audio.play()`, the existing connection remains live but the UI
announces audible output as blocked and offers a user-gesture retry; retrying
playback neither begins another mode nor negotiates another provider call.
Diagnostics distinguish permission, device, autoplay, negotiation, rotation,
reconnect, lost-owner, and terminal-stop transitions without SDP, credentials,
audio, or transcript bodies.

Only provider `turn.done` events persist transcript truth: one complete
role-bearing user or assistant entry per provider turn. Live transcript deltas
remain non-authoritative. Each `delegation.created` carries the bounded finalized
dialogue since the previous delegation and records its transcript fence. When
voice ends, the browser first seals and durably drains every already-parsed V3
event. The same end transaction then selects only finalized transcript after the
latest delegation fence, excludes a late user `turn.done` already represented by
that delegation, renders a bounded Codex-style XML tail, and submits it through
the canonical ordinary `Steer` path. The associated
`session_realtime_context_projections` row is idempotency/audit provenance for
that durable tail turn; workers perform no hidden next-turn injection. An empty
tail creates no turn. A later voice call receives both bounded durable session
history and bounded prior finalized voice turns as inert, role-labeled startup
context with an explicit silence instruction. Canonical:
`packages/sdk/src/codex-realtime-v3.ts`,
`packages/db/src/session-realtime-context.ts`, and
`apps/api/src/session-realtime-context.ts`.

A provider `delegation.created` uses the same execution path as a human change
of direction. After exact owner, active connection epoch, and provider-start
proof, one transaction ledgers the call and invokes canonical prompt `Steer` on
that same session with a service initiator and immutable realtime provenance.
Idle work queues normally; active work is superseded/interrupted; queued work is
reordered by the existing Steer semantics. The call row links one-to-one to the
turn for terminal result/error projection. Invalid calls receive a deterministic
outbound error; transient admission failure rolls call and Steer back together.
No separate realtime worker-claim exception or voice-only turn semantics exist.
Completion, failure, and cancellation atomically append one turn-linked
`delegation_result` or deterministic `error` while that exact realtime
delegation remains active. Steer is session continuation: realtime receives the
accepted direction and later agent stream through session context, with no
synthetic stopped/error message. Progress uses commentary
`delegation.context.append`; completion uses speakable
`delegation.context.append`. Work that predated voice, was sent by the
human composer, or belongs to a prior voice call instead follows the active
session-wide route: commentary progress and speakable terminal output use
`session.context.append`. Accepted human Send/Steer is mirrored once through
that same session-wide route without a channel, in a typed envelope saying it
was already accepted by execution; voice therefore understands the change but
does not delegate it again. The browser durably ACKs receipt of each row from
OpenGeni. Pinned V3 exposes no provider receipt for either append event, so
provider sends remain at-least-once: a live
bridge suppresses repeat sends only within that generation after a full local
send, while a browser crash or connection rotation replays the same durable row
and may repeat an ambiguous provider append. Stale connection identities cannot
advance even the client-delivery ACK. No child session, fork, handoff framework,
or after-commit admission loop exists.

Every accepted turn also carries one immutable `TurnInitiator`. Human/API
Send and Steer capture the authenticated subject that accepted the command;
schedules, goal continuation, compaction, and coalesced internal batches use
explicit service principals. An Agent Steer remains the causal initiator when
authority-neutral ordinary machine notices coalesce into its inference; those
notices cannot erase the steering subject merely because they arrived in the
same batch. Child lifecycle, command and goal-continuation updates retain their
exact target causal turn. Different originating turns may coalesce only when
they resolve to the same receiving-session human and their frozen execution
permissions match. Unresolved origins keep exact-turn isolation; Agent Steer
keeps its exact caller attempt. A malformed historical authority-bearing update also receives an
isolated claim instead of borrowing a coalesced principal; Agent Steer lineage
is complete only when the caller session, turn, attempt, and execution
generation all validate. The session creator is stored separately and is
copied only when idempotently repairing that same create command's first turn.
Queue move/edit/resubmit preserves the original initiator, while Steer creates a
new turn with the steering actor. Agent-created work inherits the frozen
initiator through the worker-signed calling-turn reference and appends bounded
provenance. Approval, structured-human-input response, recovery, and retry
reuse the existing row and therefore cannot change authority. Legacy rows use
`{ kind: "service", subjectId: "unattributed-legacy" }`, which host credential
ports must reject rather than infer from another identity.

An embedding host may separate authorization from causal service provenance by
signing a service-only initiator into its delegated grant. The ordinary grant
subject and permissions still authorize the command; the asserted service is
only the immutable initiator of the newly created work. It cannot assert a
human subject or override a worker-signed exact agent attempt.

Connection ownership is a different axis. Capability setup defaults to a
workspace-owned OAuth/API-key connection, available under normal workspace
authorization; **Connect only for me** explicitly creates a subject-owned row.
A turn can execute a personal row only when it carries an exact immutable
`McpPersonalConnectionDelegation` containing the selected MCP server, connection,
owner, provider, and kind. Those private identifiers never enter public queue,
turn, or task payloads: the disclosure there is only `{serverId,
providerDomain}`.

Direct session creation, Send, and Steer freeze the authenticated subject's
currently selected active personal rows. Queue editing preserves that snapshot.
Agent Message and Agent Steer copy the calling turn's snapshot through the
worker-signed exact turn reference. A child session stores immutable
`parent_turn_id` and copies that spawning turn, rather than consulting whichever
turn is latest later. Approval, structured input, capacity recovery, and worker
recovery remain the same logical turn and therefore retain the same snapshot.
No path infers personal authority from the session creator, current user,
service initiator, latest connection, latest queue head, or an unrelated newer
turn.

That same exact calling-turn boundary supplies an agent-spawned child's omitted
model, reasoning effort, and latency mode. Explicit child values may override
them. A Codex-subscription manager therefore keeps its external billing path for
workers by default instead of falling back to the deployment's OpenGeni-credit
model.

Session detail reads expose `dispatchWait` for active-control queued sessions
without an active turn. It projects the existing workflow-wake ledger's pending
revision, attempt count, retry time and last error; it is not an execution
receipt. Acknowledged or unavailable delivery evidence never implies running.
The visible queued session refreshes this non-event evidence while waiting.
Sidebar queued/capacity counts use a clock and remain distinct from working
counts; deliberate session waits retain their reason and recheck presentation.

The prompt queue is not worker backlog. `session_turns.status = 'queued'` means
the worker has not claimed the physical row; it does not decide whether the user
sees a queued prompt. Immutable `session_turns.prompt_routing` records that
admission decision: `accepted_for_execution` and `accepted_for_steering` stay in
chat, while only `queued_for_execution` appears in the prompt queue. Null remains
a conservative visible-queue fallback for rolling/legacy writers. New durable
`user.message` and `turn.queued` events repeat the same routing fact so live
streaming and reload reconstruction cannot briefly place a prompt on the wrong
surface. In particular,
human prompts preserved behind paused session/workspace gates are intentionally
ineligible and do not schedule an activity. Fleet pressure comes from Temporal's
dedicated `runAgentTurn` activity queue (`approximateBacklogCount` and oldest
backlog age), together with the turn workers' used/memory-safe slots. Each turn
worker must obtain a cgroup-aware slot before polling. Admission is capped at the
measured density of 16 and reserves a hard 100 MiB per turn plus 512 MiB of
runtime/native headroom; a finite container that cannot safely admit one turn
does not start. The invariant is checked both before and after Temporal's native
worker construction, and live retained-memory growth contracts new slot
availability. Before decoding model-facing JSONB, PostgreSQL rejects a complete
active transcript above any of four materialization limits: 15 MiB UTF-8 JSON,
8,192 rows, 131,072 decoded JSON nodes, or 65,536 object properties. It never
silently trims conversation truth; normal proactive compaction keeps long
sessions under the boundary. Pause stores only the open-suffix sentinel; the
approval/run-state serving envelope still rejects leftover SDK heaps above 3 MiB,
65,536 nodes, or 32,768 properties so they cannot enter a serving worker. A missing or malformed Temporal task-queue stats
object is a failed read and makes the capacity sample stale; it is never
normalized into a fresh zero backlog. The release target remains at most
50 MiB incremental RSS per active turn. A production read-only forensic
fingerprint over 3,823 sessions exited 137 inside a 1 GiB serving API pod; heavy
forensics and density profiling therefore run only in a bounded non-serving
execution class and never in API or turn-worker serving pods. See
[`deployment.md`](deployment.md) for the reproducible density harness.

Compact agent discovery keeps that queue boundary intact. `queuedPromptCount`
reports waiting human/API work, while `sessions_list` `includeLastMessage` and
the MCP `session_events` monitoring read omit a human/API `user.message` whose
accepted turn was never claimed, so an orchestrator cannot mistake a waiting or
pre-claim-terminal prompt (deleted, edited, cancelled) for processed
conversation. The predicate is `session_turns.started_at IS NULL`: every claim
path stamps `started_at` in the transaction that moves the turn to `running`
and nothing clears it, so it cannot drift with the status vocabulary. Once the
turn is claimed the exact stored row appears at its original sequence. Two
consequences follow: an admission-rejected human/API turn (never claimed,
settled `failed`) keeps its prompt hidden from agent monitoring while its
`turn.failed` stays visible, and a turn that the removed worker-death
preemption requeue (`requeuePreemptedTurn`, Jun 12 - Jul 14 2026) reset to
`started_at IS NULL` and that was cancelled before any re-claim stays hidden
there too. The probe is served by the partial index
`session_turns_unclaimed_prompt_trigger_idx` (migration 0322). The
filter is agent-monitoring only: REST event pages (which the browser composer
uses to reconcile an outcome-unknown Send by `clientEventId`), SSE, and forensic
reads stay byte-identical, and stored events are never rewritten.

Related-work search is another compact projection over this same durable state,
not a new run-lifecycle input. It searches semantic titles, active goals, and
bounded typed work claims only after ordinary authorization/host narrowing; it
never searches opening prompts or makes a claim control the turn, goal, queue,
or worker. Terminal goal/session lifecycle settles active claim evidence while
Pause and recovery preserve it. See
[`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md) for the complete authority, ranking,
mutation, and rollout contract.

A realtime delegation admitted from the ledger sync inherits the same way
unless its `delegation_call` entry names a route (`model`, `reasoningEffort`,
`latencyMode`). A named route is resolved exactly like a Send/Steer body before
the ledger transaction -- omitted parts fall back to the session defaults, the
model is canonicalized and checked against the workspace model policy and the
session's provider lock, and the requested parts are recorded with source
`explicit` -- and it applies to that one turn only. A routed entry the API did
not resolve is refused, and replaying the same operation on another route is
`REALTIME_DELEGATION_CHANGED`.

Synthesized goal continuations inherit the model and reasoning effort from the
newest turn with a durable `turn.started` event. The session default is used
only when no turn has actually started. This keeps routing and billing
ownership aligned after an explicit per-turn switch and excludes turns rejected
during admission, whose `started_at` claim timestamp alone is not proof that
their policy ran. The continuation records the exact latest finished
`causalTurnId` and copies that turn's personal delegation snapshot when it is
materialized; a later unrelated human turn cannot mutate the frozen update.
Spawned-child terminal results retain the spawning parent-turn snapshot in the
outbox and enter the parent's bounded typed internal-update batch without
injecting a synthetic `user.message` or a human queue row. Ordinary internal
updates coalesce only when their personal delegation snapshots match; Agent
Steer remains the authoritative initiator and delegation source when compatible
notices join it. Claim persists the exact deterministic batch and authority in
`session_history_items`/the claimed turn before inference and links every member
to that row. Recovery reuses it; later reconciliation never filters it from
model memory.

Immediately after claim, the exact owning attempt installs or reads the
logical turn's accepted execution policy before credit admission, credential
allocation, compaction, or provider work. That value-free metadata policy
freezes the public product model id, provider id, upstream deployment id, credential-source
class, billing attribution, wire API, and definition version. The public id is
not necessarily the provider request id: `codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, for example,
routes upstream as `gpt-5.6-sol`. Billing and Codex allocator eligibility are
derived from the explicit accepted attribution, never from a model prefix or a
mutable active-credential snapshot; malformed present metadata fails closed.
If operational database access fails after the atomic attempt claim but before
turn-start completion, the activity exports only the exact turn, trigger,
generation, and safe database failure class. The workflow's unbounded-retry
DB-only control lane revalidates that identity, closes the same attempt as
recovering, and backs off before a replacement claim; it never converts the
claimed inference into a terminal failure or a new prompt.
The same database-owned transition covers a lost claim commit response: if the
activity reports retryable pre-claim failure but the control lane finds its
exact active attempt, that durable attempt wins and is recovered.

Versioned control observers distinguish unavailable session reads from idle
business state. Missing and RLS-hidden rows are indistinguishable; neither is
evidence of deletion, completion, or permission to resume. An unavailable
observer retains a signal-interruptible 30-second control wait because restoring
visibility is not guaranteed to produce a wake. The wake outbox retains its
revision with `session_unavailable` and its existing bounded retry schedule.
Restoring visibility never undoes an authoritative Pause or cancellation.

A running turn with an exact live attempt is an `attempt-owned` observation,
not another dispatch. The control activity inspects the exact Temporal
workflow/run/activity and re-reads the turn/attempt/generation afterward.
Pending, settled, or unavailable inspector results never revoke that writer or
admit a successor: a settled Temporal activity alone is not physical-writer
quiescence proof. The workflow waits for a signal or its bounded control timer;
normal history rollover preserves the observer. Recovery of an orphaned live
owner remains a separate exact-proof lifecycle operation, not an age-based
fallback or a reuse of the closed-attempt quiescence reconciler.

A permanent admission failure with no claimed turn records the supplied failure
message and, when available, its classified admission cause on the durable
`session.status.changed` event. The absence of a `turn.failed` event must not
discard those diagnostics. Older events remain unchanged; missing historical
details cannot be reconstructed from the failure code alone.

SuperGrok/xAI connected-subscription work separately freezes an identifier-free
`workspace | user` provider-account authority snapshot. Workspace is the
default shared pool. User scope is explicit/private and remains bound to the
exact initiating human. Send, Steer, edits, children, goal continuations,
schedules, compaction, and internal updates copy only their exact causal
snapshot; runtime never substitutes the session creator, current browser user,
worker identity, or another member's account. See
[`supergrok-subscription.md`](supergrok-subscription.md).

Ordinary agent messages, like Steer, inherit initiating-human identity from the
exact admitted sender turn. Empty personal-connection selections or workspace
provider scope do not erase that identity. Different sender attempts own separate
causal batches; malformed historical message lineage cannot borrow another
update's human. Genuine service-only source turns remain service-only. This
preserves identity without expanding accepted connection selections or replacing
the receiving session's tool configuration.

The same accepted logical-turn boundary governs prompt policy and structured
preferences. After claim, the owning attempt installs immutable instruction-
policy and preference-descriptor snapshots reconstructed from lifecycle events
as of the turn's immutable `created_at`, not from mutable heads at claim time.
Service-only turns have no human preference scope and skip the preference
snapshot capability entirely; service continuations carrying a frozen causal
human and legacy subject turns still snapshot that human's applicable entries.
The session's normalized policy role is independent of workspace membership and
memory roles. The bounded, update-immutable
`session_turns.initiating_human_subject_id` is the accepted turn's causal-human
selector, not a standalone grant or a way for a service to impersonate that
human. Named human-bound capabilities may consume it only with their own exact
fences. The generic workspace-artifact mutation family (create, publish,
rollback, archive, and restore) is one narrow
attempt-scoped use: a service-initiated turn may proceed only when the field
retains a human, the request carries worker-signed exact attempt claims, and
PostgreSQL revalidates their session/turn/attempt/execution generation, current
live turn and attempt, selected artifact mutation tool, `artifacts:publish`, and
absence of a pending interruption; pure service work fails closed. Direct human
artifact API requests instead authorize from their ordinary authenticated access
grant. Within governance, service-initiated goal continuations and compactions
use the frozen causal human as the personal-preference subject while retaining
their service initiator; pure service work has no personal-preference scope.
Runtime composition is deterministic: core safety,
organization/workspace/user preference descriptors plus organization/global,
workspace, and role policy, then durable session instructions, tool/repository/
skill substrate, and memory. Optional application `modelContext` is not part of
that prefix: claim stores it as a separate leading `input_text` part of the
exact chronological user message. Standard timeline rendering omits it, while
full audit data retains it. Documents and RAG evidence never become policy,
and full preference bodies require explicit retrieval. When no structured
governance applies, the legacy prompt bytes remain unchanged.

Turn acceptance freezes Agent learning policy in `agent_learning_snapshots`:
the owner layer, effective Knowledge/instruction/Skill modes, and the accepted
chat or scheduled-run context. Child work and replacement attempts reuse their
producer's accepted policy. Legacy `memoryEnabled` opt-outs are converted to the
Knowledge setting; the old setting cannot be changed after 0461.

Ordinary turn acceptance does not parse or publish chat attachments into Knowledge.
Original attachments keep their existing exact-turn resource lifecycle. Agents
explicitly select useful findings and retain supporting sources when needed.

Retained Knowledge is retrieval context. It is not ambient conversation memory
or behavioral authority. Explicit `view: "needs_review"` lets agents inspect and correct unapproved proposals without activating them. Normal search excludes pending revisions; source ACLs,
exact evidence revisions and scope checks apply before ranking. Review-first
saves return inactive receipts and let the turn continue. Mandatory instructions
and Skill descriptors retain their existing governance snapshots and prompt
composition; private company profile composition and root/child rules are unchanged.
See [`knowledge.md`](knowledge.md) for storage, migration and review.

Approval, capacity wait, worker recovery, and Pause/Resume create newer
attempts for the **same logical turn**, so they must replay the original policy
rather than resolve or overwrite it; they also reuse the accepted governance
snapshots. A new user/API turn or a newly materialized goal, system,
child-result, scheduled, or compaction turn is a new logical turn and resolves
fresh execution and governance policy. Thus a per-turn model/provider switch
persists through recovery without accidentally becoming a permanent session
default, while later policy or preference changes affect only later accepted
turns.

**Runs have no default length limits, by design.** What the SDK calls "turns" are model
calls; `OPENGENI_AGENT_MAX_MODEL_CALLS_PER_TURN` exists but defaults to
effectively unbounded. There is no continuation cap and the agent activity's
Temporal timeout is measured in days, not hours. OpenGeni is built for agents
that legitimately run for a very long time. Budget/admission policy and
explicit goal completion or pause bound execution; OpenGeni does not infer
"no progress" from tool/event shape. Do not reintroduce default count- or
duration-based caps on legitimate run length; fix the pathology instead.

Recoverable conditions preserve context instead of failing the session, so a
long run survives them. Retryable provider connectivity, 5xx failures, and typed
required-MCP connectivity failures resume the same accepted turn after a pacing
delay. Native Modal `TaskExecStart` recovery is safe only when the client-side
channel-readiness gate fails before issuing the RPC. This also covers resolver
failure for no-port `task-*.w.modal.host` URLs without trusting DNS-shaped
server replies. After exact never-started reservation settlement, OpenGeni
resumes the same accepted turn through bounded connectivity backoff. Retained
or outcome-unknown routing errors veto recovery even if their causes look safe.
Generic `TaskExecStart` `UNAVAILABLE`, server-supplied DNS text, mixed failure
batches, message-only lookalikes, HTTP status metadata, and the exact
`FAILED_PRECONDITION: Modal Sandbox is shutting down` condition remain
non-retryable because pre-command safety is not proven. Required first-party
connect/tools-list also treats a rolling API
replacement's temporary `404` or statusless plain transport `Error` as
recovery-safe. That narrow exception does not apply to external MCP servers,
tool invocation, explicit non-404 client responses, or typed
protocol/programming failures. The retry classifier records typed out-of-band
category metadata without rewriting the exact source diagnostic retained by
OpenGeni. A failed MCP request records its HTTP method, parsed JSON-RPC method
when available, and a bounded exact source/cause chain in the durable recovery
detail before SDK layers can flatten the transport error. Only genuinely public
SDK/console diagnostics receive a fixed structural projection; raw transport
messages, URLs, and response bodies remain exact on internal data paths. Other
HTTP client failures and unknown provider codes remain authoritative and
terminal. Hitting an explicitly configured
model-call cap and budget/credit exhaustion ends the current turn gracefully;
an active goal may create a later continuation, while an otherwise idle session
waits for the next user message. For an MCP timeout that escapes after a
successful tool output, conversation truth is checkpointed before the turn
settles and the continuation is a new follow-up — the completed tool call/full
turn is never blindly replayed. Budget/credit exhaustion likewise idles the turn
rather than failing the session, so a top-up lets the same session continue.

Fresh progressive-disclosure attempts complete only session-marked eager MCP
connection and schema admission before inference. All non-eager MCPs—strict or
optional—connect/list concurrently with the first provider request. A plain
terminal model response does not join that background work. Preparation-independent
tools such as `skill_read` execute without joining it. Other local
function calls join the one exact preparation promise before Runner can
dispatch it, including always-visible base tools such as `exec_command` and
`write_stdin`; their stable first-request schemas remain eager, but their
execution does not bypass catalog persistence. An in-process model-tool server
is never bound to a provisional local-only catalog: its first invocation waits
for and uses the final environment containing every admitted local and MCP
definition, which is the same environment exposed to Codemode. Search
disclosure, deferred
invocation, Codemode activation, catalog persistence, and cleanup join that same
promise, so no partial catalog grants authority. An exact preparation failure is
therefore observed at the first tool-call boundary and the tool body never runs.
Approval/human-interaction resumes and editable-artifact turns retain the fully
prepared catalog path because their continuation depends on exact prior tool or
catalog identity.

Codemode submission compares the caller's catalog digest with the exact active
catalog before creating its durable operation. A mismatch returns the stable
`codemode_catalog_stale` code; the client may then refresh once, re-resolve the
identity/path, and retry with the same operation id. It never performs that
recovery after an operation exists or after an ambiguous transport failure.
Worker dispatch performs catalog, identity, approval, input-schema,
authorization, and argument-sensitive connector-policy prepare before writing
the execution-start marker. Ask, Block, unavailable policy, and rejected frozen
connector authority therefore settle before the provider executor can run.
After the marker, the prepared gateway call performs durable connector begin at
the executor boundary and completes the same request as `completed`,
`not_executed`, or `uncertain`. Model MCP and Codemode use this same canonical
gateway lifecycle; the model SDK wrapper only projects Ask into the ordinary
human-approval interruption and carries the exact approved call id into a
host-only invocation context on resume. The gateway rejects a direct model call
to an `approval: human` entry when that context is absent or belongs to another
tool/subject. A client
`AbortSignal` is observer-only: it stops HTTP/polling waits but creates no server
cancellation authority. Attempt/turn interruption remains the sole cancellation
boundary and still drains or closes journaled work under the existing lifecycle.

Retryable provider connectivity and 5xx failures recover the same accepted turn
after a durable 2 s, 5 s, 15 s, 30 s, then 60 s capped delay, indexed by that
turn's durable consecutive provider-recovery count rather than unrelated
execution attempts. A fenced current-attempt `agent.model.request` completion
atomically clears that durable count with its event; only after the commit does
the worker clear its in-memory copy. Failed requests and late/zombie completion
events cannot reset the streak. Successful inference between transient outages
therefore starts the next outage at the first backoff step instead of consuming
a lifetime budget for a long-running turn.
An explicit provider retry hint is a lower bound. Rate limits use the provider's
`Retry-After` when present and otherwise wait 60 s; other retryable classes keep
their existing pacing. Failed session detail includes a bounded `failureDiagnostics` projection through
its durable event cursor. The browser uses it independently of retained timeline
pages; a newer accepted live failure supersedes it while detail refreshes. The
banner displays `providerRecoveryCount` only as the final consecutive automatic
retry streak, never as the total number of recoveries or failed turns. Missing
historical counts remain unknown. Two indexed latest-event reads select this
projection; detail polling never aggregates the session's lifetime event log.
The initial session status and replay cursor come from one SQL statement
snapshot, so a concurrent revival cannot pair an old failed status with a cursor
that skips the revival event. Diagnostic text is decoded through the lossless
storage codec before its bounded logical prefix is returned; omitted suffixes
are disclosed and exact event bytes remain in storage.

Automatic same-turn provider/MCP recovery is finite: five
consecutive replacement attempts may be scheduled, and a sixth retryable failure settles the
same logical turn as failed with the original typed cause plus explicit recovery-
exhaustion evidence. This is an infrastructure retry budget, not a goal,
continuation, model-call, or run-length cap; a later human/API prompt may retry as
new accepted work. If an operational database outage interrupts the recovery
checkpoint itself, the existing post-claim failure wire carries the immutable
turn identity, classified provider cause, and exact next recovery count into the
DB-only control lane. That lane accepts the checkpoint only when the identity
still owns the attempt and the count is exactly one beyond durable turn metadata;
ambiguous commits and stale replays therefore cannot reset the retry budget.
An accepted-model definition mismatch during mixed-version rollout uses that
same finite budget and backoff only for the typed configuration mismatch before
`turn.started` and before any model request. It reclaims the exact accepted turn
without refreshing its policy, model, billing source, or credentials. Malformed
policies, explicit provider/credential/billing identity changes, and other setup
failures are not admitted to this retry lane. No model
or tool history is replayed; normal control fencing and physical-attempt
quiescence still gate successors. Exhaustion reports the fixed definition
mismatch and configuration-recovery exhaustion, not a transient network failure
or Temporal's generic activity wrapper.
Every Steer commits a control wake revision, including when
the recovering turn has no live attempt. A later coalesced Send cannot downgrade
it to an ordinary queue signal, so the workflow interrupts the hold and processes
the new direction immediately.

Codex-subscription turns add one explicit recovery boundary before the model
run. The worker always selects and leases a credential atomically under the
workspace rotation-row lock; concurrent replicas
therefore observe earlier reservations. A second 401, 403, explicit quota, or
429 can quarantine that credential and requeue the same durable turn after a
conversation-truth checkpoint. Network/5xx/invalid-content/partial-stream
failures never rotate or blindly replay. The first accepted failover freezes its
enabled-alternate ceiling in turn metadata, so later pool changes neither strand
an originally permitted account nor extend the same-turn retry budget. The allocator, strict workspace scope,
five-hour reset semantics, and rollout fence are canonical in
[`codex-subscription-rotation.md`](codex-subscription-rotation.md).
The first successful lease also stores a bounded accepted Codex allocator-policy
snapshot in turn metadata. Re-acquisition and definitive-failure settlement use
that snapshot for active-pointer, rotation, strategy, and pin constraints while
using current account health/cooldowns; background policy changes affect later
logical turns. An explicit session account switch may revise selection for a
capacity-blocked turn under the allocator/session/turn/waiter locks, with a
closed attempt and matching wait generation. It preserves the accepted
credential source, authority, conversation history, and logical turn identity.
Immediately before provider dispatch, a missing or expired
last-confirmed lease deadline is treated as lease loss and follows lease-loss
settlement instead of reaching the provider.

SuperGrok/xAI uses the same provider-tagged durable same-turn wait protocol but
with its explicit workspace-or-user authority pool. A definitive typed or
marked 401, 403, or 429 may quarantine only the exact leased credential while
the attempt is atomically closed and preserved. HTTP 200 SSE terminals match
that 429 path only for known overload/rate-limit codes or the observed Grok
sentence "The model is currently at capacity due to high demand..."; isolated
"high demand"/"overloaded" wording is not enough. Ambiguous 5xx, partial
streams, and unrelated errors never walk the pool. See
[`supergrok-subscription.md`](supergrok-subscription.md).

When the policy-selected credential is allocator-disabled, or every
allocator-enabled Codex credential is unavailable, this recovery boundary
becomes a durable capacity wait for the current logical turn, whether or not the
session has an active goal. The worker atomically closes the exact
attempt with outcome `waiting_capacity`, leaves the turn and session
nonterminal with the same active-turn pointer, and stores one session-scoped
waiter fenced by blocked turn generation, accepted policy hash, and the
effective admission gate. An active goal adds an optional id/version fence; it
does not own the waiter or the turn.

The workflow waits for the earliest authoritative provider reset or a bounded
value-free metadata refresh. Capacity-affecting writes increment a
same-transaction wake revision before a best-effort Temporal signal.
Duplicate/lost signals are harmless: row-locked re-evaluation is the sole
resume writer, and unobserved revisions repair commit-to-signal loss after
restart or `continueAsNew`; a signal delivered between waiter commit and the
activity result is compared against the workflow's pre-dispatch wake counters
and cannot be baselined away. Capacity return atomically moves that exact turn
to `recovering`; ordinary attempt admission then claims the same turn id with a
new attempt before provider/model/tool/billing work starts. It creates no
system update, new queue turn, user message, usage event, or goal continuation,
and it does not independently settle/requeue the blocked turn, poll with
inference, redeem a reset/boost entitlement, create a consent prompt, or borrow
another user's account. For SuperGrok, account reconnect,
allocator/rotation changes, and exact lease release durably advance the same
waiter plus workflow-wake outbox.

Ordinary prompts queued during the wait remain behind the current turn. Pause
leaves the waiter intact and lets the workflow close; Resume's revisioned
`signalWithStart` wake reconstructs it. Steer, cancellation, and changes to the
optional goal, downstream accepted credential-policy hash, or blocked-turn
generation supersede the waiter/turn under their durable fences. Background
Codex rotation or pin settings do not replace the accepted snapshot. An explicit
account switch uses `switchSessionCodexAccount` to update a blocked selection,
record its control receipt, and request a capacity recheck atomically. Ordinary
lease claim reads that same revised selection; no new turn or automatic model
retry is created by the switch itself.

Provider context-window overflow is also handled inside the activity, not by a
Temporal retry. When an OpenAI/Azure context overflow is classified,
`runAgentTurn` invokes compaction for the session's frozen mode: portable
Codex-local plaintext for non-Codex and portable-locked Codex sessions, or
Codex remote compaction v2 for `remote_v2` Codex sessions. On the portable path the summarizer
receives a bounded, protocol-valid temporary copy of structured active history
plus the checkpoint prompt. Portable Responses also detach optional stored item
ids from that copy while preserving required hosted/approval/program identities
and tool correlation. Only the Azure wire profile forces `tool_choice: "none"`;
other transports retain their existing behavior, including rejection of tool-only
summaries. See [context compaction](context-compaction.md#portable-responses-identity-regression).
Aggregate tool outputs are replaced oldest-first in
that copy; whole oldest user-delimited units are removed only if necessary. A
provider overflow gets one smaller refit, so the path performs at most two
provider calls rather than one failing request per history item. Other failures
propagate without changing active history. Remote v2 likewise keeps its first
request unchanged and, only for the exact `context_length_exceeded` code, makes
one same-endpoint retry with tool-result bodies temporarily reduced while every
message, reasoning item, call/result identity, checkpoint, and item position is
preserved. It never drops history units, folds chunks, or falls back to portable.
A Codex terminal SSE failure carried
on HTTP 200 is converted to one bounded, marked, non-retried provider error; it
cannot masquerade as an empty successful summary. After a fenced durable
replacement, the same activity, turn, attempt, and sandbox rebuild model input
and continue; compaction itself never creates queue or recovery work. If that
fresh continuation ends without any terminal model response, it is not accepted
as an empty completion: cancellation still wins, otherwise the compacted
checkpoint enters the ordinary bounded same-turn recovery path while newer
queued prompts remain behind it. Steer admission is immediate but deliberately
does not interrupt while the latest exact-attempt compaction landmark is
`started`, because an interruption row would also fence the terminal checkpoint
write. Once `session.context.compacted` or
`session.context.compaction.skipped` is durable, a waiting human/API or Agent
Steer cooperatively settles the ordinary turn as `superseded` before another
model request. A claimed standalone compaction instead completes its maintenance
turn, then the waiting Steer is first to claim. Pause and Cancel remain immediate
interruption fences.
A no-shrink result publishes a clear recovery message and leaves the session
`idle`, so zero-progress churn cannot loop. Exhausted, empty-summary, or
otherwise failed compaction identifies compaction summarization or the provider
failure, never installs a mechanical summary, and preserves active history. A
failed same-turn recovery atomically settles the exact turn and ends that
workflow run. Every input already visible to the model remains delivered in
durable history; it is never requeued or terminalized. Newly arriving machine
updates remain pending. Without a newer actionable work wake, the workflow
cannot synthesize another goal continuation from unchanged history. A later
human/API prompt, Steer, explicitly requested Compact, or genuinely new machine
input may create newer truth and make one new attempt.

Resolved model context metadata is authoritative on every model-facing path.
For the Codex subscription catalog this means a 272,000-token raw window, a
258,400-token effective input ceiling (95%), and automatic compaction at
244,800 tokens (90%, reached with `>=`). Local checkpoint replacement retains
only the newest real user messages that fit one cumulative 20,000-token budget,
then appends the summary; internal resume notices are never retained as user
intent. Automatic compaction uses provider-reported usage only: the durable
prior-call input count at a turn boundary, or the immediately preceding
same-activity provider total plus bounded newly appended input. With no bound
provider count, OpenGeni sends the request and recovers from a genuine provider
context overflow instead of compacting from a whole-request approximation.
Each authoritative terminal response replaces the durable count with its usable
input count or null; an omitted count never leaves an older response active.
Local media-aware estimates remain confined to compaction-request fitting and
history-only replacement reporting. See
[`context-compaction.md`](context-compaction.md).

Outside the explicit durable compaction transition, model-visible history is
append-only. Given an unchanged canonical prefix and runtime settings, every
later provider request must reproduce that serialized filtered prefix exactly.
Request-time filters may normalize computer calls, normalize provider item
identities, or bound tool output deterministically; they may not classify or
rewrite arbitrary textual content and may not remove or reorder an
earlier `view_image` call/result pair. Computer-use tools are likewise exposed
only when the caller supplies a proven visual transport: Responses wires
(including Gateway Kimi and SuperGrok) and Codex use `computer_*` function
tools with structured image results when the model catalog lists image input.
Gateway DeepSeek stays text-only and therefore receives neither image input nor
computer tools. Chat Completions receives no computer tools: tool results on
that wire are text, so a screenshot would become a base64 string rather than an
image the model sees.

Before model/tool work, a claimed turn inserts a first-class
`session_turn_attempts` row containing its exact Temporal activity id, current
trigger, monotonic dispatch generation, verified control revision, and write
lease. The same claim snapshots every per-session MCP approval policy under the
session lock and adopts the selected machine-input batch's exact personal-MCP
delegation snapshot. A real Temporal activity retry retains the activity id; a
re-dispatch creates a new attempt and captures the then-current policy. Every
event, model-history write, run-state write, compaction transition, tool receipt,
and terminal settlement must match that attempt. A typed schedule-to-start
timeout is the only no-attempt recovery case because its activity never ran.

Raw SDK tool call, result, and approval items are normalized to protocol JSON
before they enter the attempt-fenced `session_pending_tool_calls` receipt
ledger, the requires-action run-state snapshot, or a durable tool/approval event
projection. This uses the same boundary as canonical history: own object
properties with JavaScript `undefined` values are omitted as wire-absent
without mutating the SDK object, while undefined array entries and every other
non-JSON graph fail with the exact offending path. The lossless database codec
stays strict rather than silently changing arbitrary input.

Pending-call registration retries only PostgreSQL-confirmed deadlock (`40P01`)
or serialization (`40001`) rollback, with three total attempts and 25/50 ms
backoff. The worker supplies the root database handle: each attempt re-enters a
fresh RLS transaction and checks the current turn attempt fence. Passing a
caller-owned transaction would use savepoints instead and is not this contract.
A duplicate must match the same tenant/session/turn/call identity, call type,
and decoded JSON structure with exact keys (no locale collation or Unicode
normalization); its originating attempt is retained. The duplicate acknowledgement
is not permission to replay an effect. Known transport failure evidence wins over
even a nested rollback SQLSTATE and stops retries. No transport/ambiguous-commit
recovery is supported, and inference/tool execution stays outside this
database-only boundary. Exhaustion uses the canonical sanitized persistence-error
projection; the original cause remains internal diagnostic evidence.

A completed pending tool receipt retains two deliberately separate lossless
projections: the bounded SDK result item that may become model-visible history,
and the exact `agent.toolCall.output` value used by the durable audit event.
Normal publication and crash recovery consume the same retained event value, so
recovery cannot reconstruct a poorer MCP result from model-facing content or
drop open protocol extension fields.

Recoverable attempt transitions close ordinary in-flight receipts with an
explicit outcome-unknown result but preserve every receipt carrying an
`interruption_kind`. Those rows are the exact open-suffix authority a
replacement attempt needs to replay the original approval or human-input
trigger, including a result already consumed before worker loss. Capacity waits,
recoverable pause/maintenance, provider failover, graceful shutdown, and worker
death all follow that rule. Terminal failure/cancellation and superseding Steer
close the entire turn ledger. Recovery never reconstructs this authority from
history or `agent_run_states`.

For MCP, the runtime reads the complete provider `CallToolResult` through the
SDK's `callToolResult` seam and carries a private duplicate only until the exact
audit projection is durable. An HTTP-successful result with `isError: true`
therefore remains a failed tool outcome in live SDK state, model-facing history,
the pending receipt, the durable event, recovery, and the timeline. The physical
invocation boundary also records
`opengeni_mcp_tool_calls_total{outcome}` and
`opengeni_mcp_tool_call_duration_seconds{outcome}` with one closed structural
outcome: `success`, `provider_declared_error`, `auth_needed`,
`outcome_uncertain`, `timeout`, `cancelled`, `thrown_transport_error`, or
`thrown_protocol_error`. Server, tool, tenant, request, error, and content values
are deliberately absent from labels.

First-party `session_create` and `session_send_message` failures return an MCP
`isError` result with a bounded structured `{ error: { code, message } }`
projection. The durable tool-output event retains that raw MCP result, and the
React timeline promotes the two calls to worker rows that display the safe code
and message. Known authorization/control failures use fixed public wording;
unknown internal exceptions remain generic. This diagnostic projection does
not alter transaction admission, retry, or idempotency semantics.

Before a personal MCP is attached, the worker/Codemode boundary revalidates the
delegation's exact workspace membership, connection id, provider domain, kind,
owner subject, and active status. A missing, revoked, transferred, or otherwise
invalid row is never replaced with another subject's connection. Only that MCP
is omitted and the turn receives a bounded visible instruction explaining that
the source was not available and must not be claimed as used; unrelated tools
and work continue. Optional-server `initialize`/`tools/list` credential misses
do not create conversational `tool.auth_needed` cards. If the model makes a
concrete `tools/call` and authentication fails, the event includes that tool
name and remains actionable.

Session creation persists skill selection but never starts a sandbox. At turn
execution, bundled, curated, and inline session Skills use the shared
descriptor index and eager sandbox-free `skill_read`. Only an explicit
`skill_checkout` copies a selected Skill directory to the filesystem. The default
catalog includes `builtin:opengeni-client`, generated from the repository client
guide; an ordinary session can read it and its references without installing a
Skill, attaching a repository, or provisioning compute. Explicit host bundle
selections still narrow this catalog, including `[]` to exclude all defaults.
The worker discovers configured Skill descriptors during turn preparation, but
freezes the rendered catalog once per logical turn using an attempt-fenced history
receipt. The first catalog and subsequent changed catalogs are persisted developer
messages before accepted input; unchanged catalogs add no message. Earlier catalogs
remain byte-identical, and retries reuse their turn's receipt even if descriptors
changed meanwhile. The worker excludes this catalog from Agent.instructions.
Both compaction strategies restore only the latest configured catalog before retained
messages and the summary; receipts may reference inactive audit rows after compaction.
Empty catalogs explicitly report that no configured Skills are available. Provider
projection preserves developer messages for Responses and maps them to system
messages for Chat Completions without mutating canonical history. These descriptors
never grant authority. Contribution telemetry uses the frozen rendered catalog.
Existing sessions experience one instruction-prefix transition when this activates.
Standalone runtime callers retain their instruction-catalog behavior unless they
explicitly provide a durable catalog through skillCatalogInHistory.
Workspace-managed Skill reads return current authorized content, so a read can
observe a saved revision newer than its initial descriptor. Bundled/session Skill
reads use the selected attempt's artifacts. Read outputs enter ordinary tool-call
history.
If repository resources are attached, ordinary repository setup first makes
their existing checkout available; runtime then indexes canonical
`.agents/skills` and compatible `.claude/skills` directories through the bound
sandbox session before the first model call. This performs no second clone,
copy, or manifest materialization. With no repository resource, that workspace
discovery capability is absent and cannot force provisioning. Repository descriptors
carry an exact `repository:` identifier and `repository_skill_read` reader; that
sandbox capability reads current files in place, including referenced text and
bounded file inventories. Configured `skill_read` stays sandbox-free and does
not resolve repository names. Identifiers cannot silently switch between these
sources, even when names match. Repository metadata uses the same YAML parser as
portable Skills, retaining multiline description text in the JSON descriptor.
Discovery, inventories, and reading accept ordinary files and directories;
symlink Skill entrypoints are excluded because portable filesystem APIs cannot
prove target containment. The repository index remains a separate sandbox-SDK instruction source, outside
the configured-catalog history lifecycle above. It is fixed for the bound capability; reads
observe live edits or report missing files, and rebinding refreshes discovery.

Host-owned rotating sandbox run credentials split resolution from sandbox
materialization when lazy provisioning is enabled. The worker binds and resolves
the exact accepted turn, attempt, shared sandbox group, initiator, and effective
backend once before model preparation so partial `auth_needed` state is available
as bounded model context and reconnect UI. Only the first actual sandbox
operation enters the existing single-flight provisioner, writes that exact
resolved material to the lease before the waiting operation, and starts renewal.
A model-only turn therefore owns no credential write, renewal, lease, box, or
exact-generation cleanup work. Signed file resources are eager only on the exact
turn that attached them; historical attachment ids do not cause sandbox work.
Active model-history images are independently read from object storage. This-turn generated-video files may still copy onto the
box before dispatch; a copy miss is deferred like generated images (the
durable File remains) and does not fail the turn.

Modal materialization verification uses a fixed read-only provider probe inside
the original routed operation and capture gate. It starts once and advances its
own ephemeral output cursor until both streams are terminal; an initial output
page is not completion. It never borrows the parent workspace mutation's retained
command handle, weakens command persistence, or retries the clone/check/turn.
Success requires exit zero and the exact visibility marker. A 30-second
observation deadline and turn cancellation abort outstanding provider RPCs;
if either probe output stream fails, its sibling is aborted and both reads drain
before the provider-operation gate is released. The original error is preserved.
Aborting observation does not prove process termination. Deadline failures stay
unconfirmed and preserve the known provider execution identity in authenticated
materialization diagnostics. Other providers retain their existing verification
contract, and Connected Machine materialization remains a no-op.
Source-bearing `generate_video` calls join that same single-flight provisioner
immediately before inspecting their `/workspace` references and use the active
routed session. Text-to-video requests do not acquire a sandbox.

One model response's parallel tool calls are tracked as an in-memory settlement
batch while its stream is active; batch identity is not durable schema. A
completed response can reconcile and clear its exact call IDs even if an older
response left an unresolved receipt. Turn-end recovery searches both active and
compacted (inactive) canonical history. A complete pair made inactive by
compaction is consumed silently; it is never reactivated and never produces a
duplicate `agent.toolCall.output`. A still-active complete pair retains the
existing recovery projection because its receipt can mark a crash after memory
was saved but before the original event publish. Only genuinely unresolved
execution gets one explicit `interrupted / outcome unknown` closure.

Claim, interruption, and event-writing settlement share one lock order: the
workspace-control advisory lock plus `workspace_inference_controls FOR SHARE`
when the write is control-aware, then the actual `workspaces` row
`FOR KEY SHARE`, UUID-ordered sessions `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, UUID-ordered exact
turns `FOR UPDATE`, and UUID-ordered exact attempts `FOR UPDATE`.
`lockWorkspaceInferenceControl` takes
`pg_advisory_xact_lock[_shared](hashtextextended('workspace-control:<id>', 0))`
in the same mode before the row lock. The row lock alone is unfair: PostgreSQL
lets a new `FOR SHARE` join a share-locked tuple without queueing behind an
already waiting `FOR UPDATE`, so with many sessions continuously claiming,
settling, and appending, a Pause/Resume could wait for hours while every
HTTP caller gave up and left its backend parked with a pinned snapshot. The
heavyweight advisory queue is FIFO, so a mutator waits only for the holders that
preceded it and sharers resume right after it commits. Only genuine control
mutations (Pause/Resume/Cancel, workspace Pause/Resume, auto-resume, settings
narrowing, quiescent tree deletion) take the exclusive prefix. Read projections
(`getSession`, session lists, discovery) read the control row with lock `none`
and never join the prefix queue. Send, Steer,
queued Steer, and realtime ledger sync use
`lockWorkspaceInferenceControlForAdmission`: the shared prefix while the target
branch is active (it still excludes every control mutation, so the observed
state cannot change inside the transaction), escalating to the exclusive prefix
for a paused branch only after rolling back a savepoint, because an in-place
upgrade deadlocks as soon as two sharers escalate together. Request-scoped API
mutations pass `workspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs()`: one wall-clock budget
shared by every lock step of the admission (advisory lock, row lock, and a
savepoint escalation), so the total wait never exceeds the bound. The budget is
the `@opengeni/config` setting `workspaceControlLockTimeoutMs`
(`OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`, positive integer milliseconds,
default 20000, validated at boot); the API installs it into `@opengeni/db` once
at app construction through `configureWorkspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs`,
and nothing parses the env per request. Exceeding it fails with
the typed retryable `WorkspaceControlBusyError` before any write; `app.onError`
renders it for every route as HTTP 503 with `retryable: true`,
`outcomeUnknown: false`, and `details.code: WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`, the MCP
orchestration envelope reports `<tool>_workspace_busy` with a retry hint, and
Slack interactions keep the raw error so their classifier retries it. Worker
settlement and claims never pass a bound. The bounded request-scoped takers are
exactly: Send, Steer, queued Steer, Pause/Resume/Cancel, workspace
Pause/Resume, realtime ledger sync, queue move/edit/delete, composer draft save,
the MCP agent message and agent Steer, `updateWorkspaceSettings` (settings
narrowing, exclusive prefix), and `deleteSessionTreeIfQuiescent` (exclusive
prefix); each accepts an optional `controlLockTimeoutMs`, the API routes and
`@opengeni/core` commands pass the request budget, and a lifecycle caller that
omits it keeps the unbounded wait. The remaining HTTP-originated shared takers
stay unbounded by design: session create (`lockWorkspaceForSessionCreate`),
goal clear/update (`clearSessionGoal`, `updateSessionGoalWithEvent`), the
session MCP approval-policy and tool-policy writers
(`appendSessionEventsWithLockedSessionUpdate`, shared with worker writers), and
realtime session begin/end. They only hold `FOR SHARE`, so they wait solely
behind an exclusive holder or a queued mutator and never behind each other; a
bound there would trade a brief wait for a failed request. Generic
audit/title appends skip the control row but use the same
workspace-key-share prefix. Retained-screenshot prepare takes that same prefix
before insert so its turn/attempt FK checks cannot invert against event writers;
retry only that idempotent prepare transaction on `40P01`/`40001`. Event inserts also touch the workspace through their
foreign keys, so acquiring it later would reintroduce a claim/preemption
deadlock; the session lock excludes competing mutation while remaining compatible
with FK key-share checks. Start, requires-action, ordinary terminal, recoverable interruption,
supersession, and worker-death events commit
with turn status, session status/pointer, and `lastSequence` in one transaction.
Migration 0374 also advances `session_event_cursors` from an AFTER INSERT
statement trigger and rejects any non-contiguous batch. This is a rolling
dual-write/parity phase, not the allocator cutover: writers must keep locking
and updating `sessions.lastSequence` until Pause/Steer admission and every event
writer share the narrow cursor lock.
Generic appends and operation-keyed Agent Message/Steer commands retry PostgreSQL
`40P01`/`40001` only around their bounded, idempotent persistence transaction.
The pre-inference turn claim follows the same rule around its complete
transaction, reusing the exact workflow, run, attempt, and dispatch identities.
Provider inference, tools, live event publication, and workflow wakes remain after
that boundary and are never replayed. An exhausted or non-retryable database
failure surfaces as sanitized typed truth with SQLSTATE, stage, one correlation
ID, an equally sanitized typed cause, and allowlisted catalog identifiers—never
raw SQL text, a raw driver cause, or bound parameters.

An activity failure can occur before that transaction creates its attempt row.
The turn worker exports a stable typed Temporal disposition. Operational
database failures remain retryable. Other typed persistence rejections at the
exact `session_attempts.claim` stage with `retryOutcome = not_retryable` park
accepted work in `sessions.admission_block` with `status = requires_action`,
a sanitized SQLSTATE and `retryPolicy = explicit_recheck`; they are not terminal
failures and do not consume or rewrite queued turns, pending machine input,
history, grants, or captured principals. `OG001` identifies the exact reviewed
personal-resource initiating-membership guard; `OG002` identifies its matching
grant guard. Other errors, including unqualified `P0002`/`42501`, carry the generic
`database_claim_rejected` reason rather than a guessed authority diagnosis.
The control transaction compares the pre-dispatch session sequence/control
version and exact workflow/account, and refuses to park if a live attempt exists
or newer accepted work/control has won. A duplicate settlement is idempotent.
Claim, peek and wake acknowledgement honor the durable fence; unchanged blocked
work does not dispatch turn activities or schedule retry timers.

An authorized explicit Resume clears the selected session's block and commits
a new wake, even when inference control was already active. A newly accepted
Send or Steer also rechecks; an ordinary Send does not become Steer merely
because admission is blocked. Neither action grants missing authority or
changes earlier accepted snapshots. Repair authority through its normal
authorized lifecycle, then explicitly recheck; authority changes alone are not
a polling trigger. Pause and cancellation remain independent controls.
Only malformed non-database state and permanent claim invariants are terminal.
Retryable and rolling-legacy unknown failures record a
delayed `session_workflow_wake_outbox` revision and return an explicit
`unclaimed` result; new workflow histories retain the logical turn, back off
exponentially to a one-minute ceiling, and re-peek durable work. User/queue,
control, accepted approval, and capacity signals all interrupt that timer,
including signals received while activity execution or failure settlement is
in flight. A permanent failure atomically fails the exact still-runnable turn
(or the session-level
compaction/internal-update obligation), session, events, maintenance, and child
terminal outbox without fabricating an attempt row or looping. Raw SQL and
invariant messages never enter workflow history.

Migration 0483 is additive rolling storage. Its attempt-insert trigger prevents
old binaries from claiming through a stored block, but old workers can still
retry that rejection and old API workers do not implement explicit recheck.
Complete the API/control/turn-worker rollout before relying on the new behavior.
The workflow command change is patch-gated at each admission peek; pre-patch
commands retain their recorded shapes while the next live admission cycle can
activate the fix without a workflow restart. No migration backfills or
repairs authority, accepted input, or live session state.

Older workers could misclassify an application SQLSTATE from a session-level
internal-update claim as permanent and mark its undelivered child inputs plus
the session failed. `recoverSessionWorkFailedBeforeAttemptClaim` is the bounded
operator repair for that historical shape. It requires exact account,
workspace, workflow, operation, failure-sequence, current-sequence, and complete
failed-update-set fences; active control; no live turn or attempt; and only
undelivered child updates whose exact parent turns are completed and retain an
initiating human. It restores those named updates, appends the audited queued
status transition, and registers a signal-with-start wake in one transaction.
It is not a generic Resume or a way to reopen an arbitrary terminal session.

Older histories retain their recorded activity arguments for deterministic
replay. A still-open legacy history records a tail patch after its historical
failure activity and follows the bounded re-peek path even when a rolling legacy
activity worker returned void; an already-completed history replays its original
close. A separate pre-claim-classification marker preserves the exact v2
failure-activity arguments for histories that already recorded that command;
new histories and open histories that have not reached it can send the trigger
and typed disposition fields. The upgraded
activity derives the stable workflow id and leaves the same
durable restart obligation. Migration 0238 seeds that obligation for
already-recovering active turns whose `active_attempt_id` is null and for every
effectively active pre-attempt claim shape whose existing wake revision was
fully delivered: queued turns, accepted approval responses, released capacity
waits, manual compaction, and pending internal updates. The cutover mirrors
runtime's recursive session/workspace control algebra and excludes live
attempts, unanswered approvals, real capacity waiters, compaction-failure holds,
paused work, and healthy undelivered wakes.

After a reviewed release reaches staging, run the dry-by-default event-ordering invariant canary
with `bun run canary:session-event-ordering`. Execution requires
`OPENGENI_CANARY_EXECUTE=1`, the API base URL, workspace ID, and exactly one
canary API credential. It creates one isolated `sandboxBackend=none` session on
a `codex/*` subscription model, immediately writes a first-turn title through
the normal API, and accepts only one model-usage event plus one successful
terminal event on a unique contiguous durable sequence. The operator output is
limited to safe IDs, event counts, sequences, and model name; credentials and
event payloads are never printed.
Pause closes the exact live attempt as `interrupted_recoverable` and leaves its
logical turn `recovering`; Steer normally closes it as `superseded`, makes the
steered human prompt first, and does not revive the old turn. The exact exception
is active compaction: while the latest exact-attempt landmark is
`session.context.compaction.started`, and for the whole lifetime of a claimed
standalone compaction turn, Steer records durable waiting work but inserts no
interruption. The terminal checkpoint write therefore remains authorized; its
first safe boundary supersedes the ordinary turn before another model request,
or completes standalone maintenance before the Steer claim. A missing or
already closed owner is an event-free stale no-op. This prevents a superseded
activity that keeps running from publishing contradictory history or terminal
truth without creating a compaction/Steer retry loop.

Pause/Resume command persistence distinguishes `changed`, `unchanged`, and
`replayed` before allocating a control revision. A fresh Pause is unchanged
only when the selected direct recursive blocker is already represented, no
newer descendant run override must be invalidated, every live attempt is
already covered by an actionable Pause interruption, and no adopted command is
still running. A fresh Resume is unchanged only when the selected branch has no
undefeated blocker and every currently continuable descendant already has an
undelivered workflow wake; otherwise it advances the override and repairs wake
delivery. Workspace Pause/Resume applies the same rules across the workspace.
An unchanged result writes only its operation receipt: no control revision,
control/session event, audit event, child notice, interruption, command stop,
or workflow wake. Reusing that exact operation key remains `replayed`, not
`unchanged`.

If provider failure races with an accepted exact-attempt Pause or Steer, that
control request owns the attempt: recovery returns stale and the normal
settlement/quiescence path completes the transition. The workspace-control lock
also orders the opposite race safely—if recovery commits first, the subsequent
Steer immediately supersedes the now-ownerless recovering turn.
Terminal Cancel uses the same exact-attempt interruption fence but settles the
live turn as `cancelled`, marks the selected session and every existing
descendant terminal, and drains their queued/non-running work in the same
transaction. The workspace-control lock orders concurrent prompts and child
creation around that terminal write, so no work can appear behind the final
empty snapshot. A cancelled ancestor permanently rejects Send, Steer, Resume,
and new descendants. The cancellation transaction also advances the durable
workflow wake for every affected session, including an approval or capacity
wait with no live attempt, so the terminal row cannot leave a Temporal workflow
parked indefinitely. When the selected root is a child, the same transaction
also enqueues one deduplicated `child_terminal_result` with status `cancelled`
for its surviving parent and copies the causal parent-turn delegation snapshot;
cancelled descendants do not notify parents inside the same terminal subtree.
Terminal results are not the only child lifecycle notice. Behind
`OPENGENI_CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_ENABLED`, the child's own lifecycle
transactions also enqueue one dedupe-keyed outbox row for the parent when the
child freezes in `requires_action` (`child_requires_action`, immediate wake
class, bounded question previews and approval ids), when such a request is
answered, skipped, expired, decided, or cancelled
(`child_requires_action_resolved`), when a human/API/agent pauses the child
directly (`child_paused`), when a capacity waiter is armed
(`child_waiting_capacity`), and when the child records goal progress
(`child_progress`); the latter four are `deferred` (pending row + event, no wake,
delivered with the next claim). Each producer takes the child-lifecycle lock
prefix (the parent session row is locked with the child) and the worker delivers
the row right after the producing commit; the reaper covers crashes. See
[`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md).

A workflow run closing during a current input wait or an active goal is parked,
not completed work. Idle settlement preserves that projection and durable wake
without creating a child terminal result. Goal completion, explicit goal pause,
failed settlement, and finished goalless work retain their existing callbacks.

Every child terminal result remains a durable pending machine input even when it
arrives late. It may autonomously wake an idle parent only while the parent has
an active goal, which is the durable obligation to keep working. A goal paused
only by its continuation ceiling (`max_auto_continuations`) counts: that pause
is pacing, not intent, so the arriving result resumes the goal in the same
commit (`goal.resumed`, `reason: "external_input"`) and then wakes the parent. A
no-goal parent whose ordinary turn completed, a goal paused by the user, API,
agent, limits, or no-progress policy, a completed goal, and an already-failed
parent are settled authority: the result stays pending for a later human/new-goal
turn and cannot manufacture a new inference or rewrite the settled public status
by itself. A result arriving while the parent turn is live remains available to
that turn's ordinary loop.
The provider-neutral coordination contract creates a child only for concrete,
bounded, independently useful work with a defined integration point. Parent
work must stay disjoint from the delegated scope. A parent joining a child uses
`session_wait` with `waitFor: "completion"` before committing or publishing
dependent work. `goal.completed` is a durable goal fact, not proof that the
child has emitted its final result. Completed commentary messages, maintenance
turns, and continuation segment settlements are also ignored until an ordinary
result-bearing turn settles. The ordinary `waitFor: "change"` mode remains
available for progress monitoring.
Only physical attempt quiescence can clear the stopping projection.
When paused control remains authoritative after that receipt is durable, the
session parks as `idle` while retaining the same `recovering` logical turn and
active-turn pointer. This is projection settlement only: no claim, model/tool
work, queue row, or parent-completion notice is created. Resume later admits
that preserved turn with a new exact attempt.
Each Pause/Steer cause is a durable `session_attempt_interruptions` row; the
workflow's `sessionControl` signal is only a wake hint to settle those rows.
Wake repair treats only an undelivered control revision, an actionable
interruption, or a settled interruption whose exact attempt still lacks its
quiescence receipt as control work. A fully quiesced historical interruption is
audit evidence and cannot upgrade a later ordinary queue wake to
`sessionControl`.
For every accepted human/API prompt and Agent Steer, accepting a Temporal signal
is not an admission acknowledgement. While effective control is active, the
delivery path leaves the current coalesced workflow-wake revision
unacknowledged if any human/API turn remains physically queued, and leaves the
wake unacknowledged while the newest `agent_steer_instruction` remains pending.
An older prompt sender may still advance only its own stale revision because the
newer coalesced revision remains outstanding. The bounded outbox dispatcher can
therefore redeliver across a workflow close or `continueAsNew`; the
attempt-fenced Postgres claim consumes each prompt turn or newest instruction
once, so duplicate signals cannot duplicate inference. A real Pause is the
truthful blocker and may acknowledge the old revision; Resume commits a fresh
revision for preserved pending direction.

Control settlement and physical cancellation are deliberately separate
boundaries. A receipt-gated v2 workflow first atomically settles the exact
interruption and closes the attempt in Postgres, fencing every
model/tool/history/UI write. Only after that transaction commits does it request
Temporal cancellation using `TRY_CANCEL`; it does not await the activity
promise. Histories without the `session-attempt-quiescence-v2` patch retain the
v1 WAIT/fallback command order only for deterministic replay; new workflow runs
never select that path, and the current activity still writes the authoritative
receipt. Temporal cancellation,
completion, or failure is transport state and can never prove that a sandbox
process or parallel tool operation stopped. The turn activity heartbeat timer
and worker SDK throttle share a 500 ms bound, leaving the unchanged four-second
live control budget for physical writer drain and receipt-gated replacement
admission independently of the two-minute heartbeat timeout.
Each streamed SDK event read uses Temporal's activity cancellation signal with
one listener that is removed when the iterator advances. Never race every event
against `Context.cancelled`: that promise intentionally never settles on normal
completion and would retain one losing promise reaction per token/event for the
activity lifetime.

The dying `runAgentTurn` activity owns physical proof. It cancels the exact
turn's tool/sandbox controller, waits for all controller-owned operations to
quiesce, stops and drains attempt-owned Git, Codemode, and generic
run-credential renewal/materialization writes, and immediately writes
`session_turn_attempts.quiesced_at` before
attempt-qualified credential deletion, cache, recording, provider, lease, or
workspace housekeeping. The
receipt, its `session.queue.changed` event, the session queue/sequence update,
and the exact `session_workflow_wake_outbox` revision commit in one retryable,
idempotent transaction. The commit returns that exact still-undelivered wake;
the activity immediately attempts its `signalWithStart` before NATS fanout, and
the durable outbox retains the same revision for bounded repair if transport
fails or the worker dies after commit. Provider completion and batch flushes
that ignore
cancellation are detached with rejection handlers; all later housekeeping is
attempt-fenced and detachable. While either logical interruption or the exact
physical receipt remains pending, `effectiveControl.settlement` stays typed as
`stopping` and reports `attemptCount`, `interruptionPendingCount`, and
`quiescencePendingCount`; Resume does not clear or bypass that receipt gate.
Hosted POSIX process cancellation still validates the exact PID, process group,
and randomized command token before signalling; it reads those facts through
`ps` when available and Linux `/proc` when a minimal image omits procps. Missing
or malformed identity remains fail-closed. An explicit `tty:false` command keeps
pipe-mode stdin/stdout/stderr and never receives terminal control bytes during
cancellation; the same marker-bound process-group TERM/KILL proof remains
authoritative. Omitting `tty` preserves the existing interactive default. A
durably retained command performs marker read, token/PGID validation, TERM/KILL,
and group-absence proof in one bounded in-box helper on its exact pinned backend,
then enters one exact provider-session settlement phase. Inconclusive identity,
transport failure, or a still-live group retries that same idempotent proof and
keeps admission closed; the ordinary path does not serialize one provider round
trip per signal and poll.
Modal turn-owned exec starts use isolated command-router handles. If cancellation
arrives before `TaskExecStart` returns a provider session id, the controller
closes only that pending handle, reattaches the same sandbox for control, writes
the invocation's randomized in-box tombstone, and terminates only a marker whose
PID/PGID command line contains the same token. The wrapper publishes its marker
before checking the tombstone, so a late accepted start cannot execute user code;
the fence still waits for both exact process-group absence and the original
provider promise to settle. Timeout, missing marker, and transport failure remain
non-proof. The queue/chrome projection renders this period as stopping previous
work (or current work under Pause), never as a first-step wait or a completed
direction change.

Model-facing shell waits preserve that same cancellation boundary without
making the model poll it. `exec_command` and `write_stdin` divide the requested
wait window into provider calls of at most 250 ms, checking the turn fence
between slices. A short command therefore returns its terminal result from the
original tool call, while an explicitly short yield or a command still running
after the requested window returns the retained session id. Empty internal
polls use the exact process-control route and never create another model turn or
workspace mutation admission.
If that process's durable row already records exit or loss, a later model-visible
`write_stdin` remains fenced before provider dispatch but returns the stored
terminal exit/loss banner. It never labels a permanently dead handle as a
retryable platform fault or calls the provider again. If provider polling and a
lease-loss reconciler race to settle the same terminal state, the first durable
state and evidence reason win; a later matching state/exit proof is idempotent
and unpins the local route even when its bounded evidence reason differs, while
a contradictory state or exit code remains outcome-unknown and pinned.

The direct receipt remains the preferred path. If its three Postgres attempts
exhaust, `runAgentTurn` does not suppress the failure or infer a receipt from
Temporal terminal state. It instead retries delivery of one immutable physical
proof through `signalWithStart`, using a 250 ms-to-5 s bounded delivery backoff.
The proof binds the exact account, workspace, session, attempt, workflow id,
workflow run id, and activity id; retrying changes none of those fields and
retries only Temporal delivery, never DB eligibility or workflow state. A
missing signaler or an activity exit without either a committed receipt or an
accepted proof fails hard.

The workflow deduplicates an accepted proof and, before every ordinary peek,
close, or `continueAsNew` boundary, passes it to a DB-only control activity.
That activity has bounded executions with unbounded Temporal retry and calls
the same idempotent receipt transaction. Under the canonical control →
workspace → session → turn → attempt locks, the transaction additionally
matches the proof's exact account/workflow-run/activity dispatch before it may
set `quiesced_at`, append the queue event, advance session sequence/version, and
enqueue the exact wake revision. The signal is durable recovery evidence, not
admission authority. NATS publish happens only after the transaction and is
best-effort live fanout; a NATS failure cannot trigger proof recovery or undo a
committed receipt.

Settling or stale-rejecting an interruption atomically commits its own durable
control wake. Activity-owned recoverable shutdown commits an ordinary durable
wake in the same transaction as `turn.recovery.requested`. While the receipt is
absent, wake acknowledgement remains pending for either recovery form,
`peekSessionWork` returns `cancellation-wait`, and every claim path remains
`control-pending` from the interruption ledger alone—queue presentation metadata
is never admission authority. The workflow waits up to five seconds for a wake
and may then close without running another turn activity; the outbox continues
bounded redelivery until the exact activity disappears or supplies its proof.
When an attempt-owned retained process was the final writer, its terminal
settlement advances that outbox revision atomically, so settlement racing the
workflow's last reconciliation check cannot be lost. A proof accepted at that
timeout boundary is persisted before close. Once the
receipt commits, its coalescing outbox wake uses immediate `signalWithStart` on
the same stable workflow id, which restarts the exact
session and admits the replacement once. This event-driven path needs no
quiescence scanner, inferred timeout, polling loop, synthetic user message,
prompt/history/effect replay, or duplicate visible queue row. Admission searches
all closed attempts for a settled or stale-rejected interruption that still
lacks its receipt; a newer recovery generation cannot hide the exact predecessor
that a queued Steer is waiting for. Reconciliation still requires the bound
Temporal activity to be absent, heartbeat-expired, or attached to an exact
workflow run that Temporal reports as missing, plus no open workspace writers
or retained processes—elapsed time alone is never proof. Queue telemetry follows
the latest live interruption and any exact predecessor referenced by a queued
human/API Steer, so `stoppingPreviousAttempt` remains truthful without allowing
unrelated historical attempts to contaminate current UI.
The same DB-only reconciliation lane also repairs a paused pre-fix row whose
receipt is already durable but whose session status still says `recovering`;
that case skips Temporal liveness inspection and idempotently parks only the
session projection.

Sandbox lease warming has two distinct bounded waits. A turn attached to a
sibling creator waits at most `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_WARMING_TIMEOUT_MS` (default
600000) for that durable warming lease to settle. The creator records the exact
provider instance as soon as create/restore returns, then gives Modal's command
router a separate 60-second readiness budget before publishing the lease warm.
The two failures retain different typed stages, group and instance identities,
and truthful durations; a command-readiness failure is never rewritten as a
600-second provider-capacity failure. It terminates the unpublished instance,
rolls only the exact warming epoch back to cold, and fails the turn rather than
rapidly creating sibling boxes. Any later display/setup failure follows the same
owned cleanup path.

After a managed lease is warm, immutable Sandbox Environment setup has a second, setup-specific
single-flight boundary. One worker claims the exact `(lease epoch, provider
instance, setup spec hash)` receipt and runs the existing marker-guarded script;
sibling turns join or reuse its durable completion instead of entering the
sandbox concurrently. Join reads back off from 100 ms to a two-second ceiling
and reset when the durable revision advances. If provider execution succeeds
but database settlement is unavailable, the current turn does not replay the
script; after the bounded claim deadline, a successor re-enters the same
box-local marker and records completion. Failed setup remains fail-closed and
retryable. Per-turn Git/run credentials, Codemode tokens, Azure login,
repository clone authority, file resources, and generated media are always
prepared privately after the shared Sandbox Environment boundary.

Lazy establishment observes one correlation-qualified logical provision at a
time. Its terminal durable `sandbox.provision` event records a closed structural
stage/category/code plus internal-attempt count; expected lease supersession or
capture/rotation wait is explicitly distinct from an actual logical failure.
Provider create/resume ownership annotates the unchanged source diagnostic with
its typed boundary stage, and classification otherwise uses typed error properties
and provider status/code evidence—never arbitrary message matching. Metrics keep
logical terminal outcomes separate from internal safe retries. A typed transport
category is diagnostic only and never licenses replay of an outcome-unknown
provider create or operation.

A recovering turn fenced by an active sandbox rotation persists one exact
`(sandbox group, lease epoch)` lifecycle-wait marker. The session workflow sees
that marker during its ordinary database work peek and closes after the bounded
signal race window instead of reserving another turn-worker slot or repeating
sandbox provisioning. Every authoritative rotation-ending or epoch-advancing transaction enqueues a
durable workflow wake only for recovering sessions whose active turn carries the
matching marker. The next claim removes the marker and either rematerializes the
successor or reports the already-durable restore blocker. Non-rotation capture
transitions retain their existing short pacing, so healthy starts and unrelated
recovery paths do not gain a new query, timer, or synchronization boundary.

Lease liveness is not provider or workspace truth. The durable recovery
projection independently records provider existence, archive availability,
restore progress, and verified workspace readiness alongside lease liveness and
epoch. API attach/swap paths therefore resume the exact live instance and pass a
bounded command probe before reporting success. A legacy `warm` row projects to
`unknown` until that verification succeeds; a provider `NOT_FOUND` instead
retires only the exact `(lease_epoch, instance_id)` and advances the epoch once.

A lost provider is rematerialized by one cold-to-warming winner. Under the lease
row lock it selects one versioned archive revision. A native Modal revision must
match its immutable current artifact receipt, source mutation generation, and
canonical provider-workspace binding; the exact authenticated client embedded
in the created session must match that binding before hydration. The verified
native artifact also pins the restore client's workspace-persistence mode; the
process default governs only archive-free creations and cannot invalidate an
older selected revision. A real tar
revision instead carries byte/hash plus deterministic content-tree metadata.
Repeated starts with the same rematerialization id are idempotent; rivals and
stale progress/commit writes are fenced. Native restore trusts Modal's snapshot
semantics and verifies receipt/readiness; only tar restore verifies the restored
tree. A partial hydrate or failed verification terminates the unpublished box
and leaves typed degraded/unrecoverable state; it never publishes a clean
replacement, a previous revision, or a mixed snapshot. A legacy per-session
archive can participate only after its archive fields—never provider identity—
are imported and selected under that same lock.

An operator may explicitly authorize recovery from an older, verified checkpoint
after the provider is gone. `scripts/operator/historical-checkpoint-recovery.ts`
accepts `preview` or `authorize` and a private JSON input file. Preview needs
account/workspace/group IDs. Authorization additionally requires the exact lease
epoch, workspace and archive generations, selected revision, operation UUID,
operator subject, reason, and `acceptHistoricalCheckpoint: true`. Authorization
uses operator-controlled database access; the subject is audit attribution.
Activity checks reuse session control's pending-quiescence predicate: a historical
closed attempt without a quiescence timestamp is not itself an active writer.
Claimed/running attempts and actual pending interruption receipts remain blockers.
Every attempt in the group must be quiescent and the cold lease must have no holders or
unsettled mutations. The existing audit store retains that decision and its
generation gap. Neither generation nor checkpoint artifact provenance is
rewritten. Existing election, restore verification, and warm publication consume
the exact receipt; unrelated revisions or newer writes invalidate it. Only a
subsequent fresh checkpoint makes the archive current. This operation does not
resume a turn, modify session history, or claim recovery of unavailable writes.

### Explicit same-session historical checkpoint consent

The managed browser exposes a separate public contract at
`GET|POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/sandbox-recovery`.
GET is a bounded, provider-free projection. POST requires the canonical managed
human cookie, current session-control authority, an operation UUID, explicit
historical-checkpoint acceptance, and the exact selection returned by GET.
Agents, delegated/API principals, shared groups, non-Modal homes, active foreign
routes, legacy/unregistered archives, and `archive.previous` are unsupported.

The selection binds session/group, tenancy and route epochs, lease identity/epoch,
CURRENT artifact and revision, capture timestamp, and archive/workspace generations.
The generation gap is not a count of missing edits or files. Conversation and tool
receipts remain; changes after the checkpoint are unavailable and external effects
are not undone. No empty reset or command replay occurs.

Consent takes the existing workspace tenancy fence exclusively before checking
complete group membership, including actor-hidden sessions. It then takes the
canonical workspace-control/session/lease prefix and requires a cold, instance-free
lease with no holders, unsettled admissions, retained processes, active attempts,
pending quiescence or queued work. Current authority is checked before receipt
replay. An identical receipt replays before mutable eligibility; a changed body
with the same key conflicts. Database guards prevent group attachment, route
changes and CURRENT artifact replacement while the restore owns its selection.
The referenced CURRENT artifact stays pinned against existing checkpoint GC.
Authority revocation is not blocked and invalidates restore authorization.

Consent accepted, restoring, and verified completion are distinct projection states.
The API uses the existing direct lease election/create/verify/commit lifecycle with
an empty operation callback, not Send or Retry. Provider binding and native receipt
verification remain mandatory; native Modal verification is not a tar-tree proof.
The old generation gap and immutable artifact provenance survive publication.
Pause/Cancel and unknown-effect Retry fences remain independent. New Retry refuses
an unchanged authoritative blocked effective route; selecting another model does
not repair it, while a healthy selected Connected Machine is not blocked by its
managed home's condition.

After verified restoration, or a current selected Connected Machine projection,
the failure UI offers the existing exact failed-turn Retry as an explicit human
action, subject to its control and unknown-effect fences. Historical failure
classification and the retained recovery operation ID do not hide that action.
Model switching is not offered as a filesystem repair. A post-consent observation
or authorization failure returns only an unknown-outcome envelope, never newly
unauthorized session state or a false rejection. The browser retains its immutable
request, performs read-only status checks, and never resubmits automatically.

Every later agent build reads the durable consent receipt and includes its exact
filesystem-discontinuity warning in session instructions. This warning is outside
compactable transcript state and is reconstructed after worker restart. Prior tool
success must not be treated as proof those files still exist. Consent alone does
not claim restore success. Failed/stale public restores and a later loss after
verified recovery remain explicit blockers requiring operator review; this slice
does not introduce an abandon/reset or automatic re-consent operation.

Migration `0495_consented_sandbox_recovery.sql` is additive with DB-default-off
consent. Activation is owner-only and follows verified immutable API/control/turn
images and worker templates; see [deployment](deployment.md). Disabling new consent
does not interrupt accepted restoration or exact receipt replay. Finalized consent
receipts are immutable, survive lease churn and permanently require protocol v1
at every attempt INSERT, including `ON CONFLICT` reattachment. Ordinary, recovery,
approval, compaction and continuation claims all use that boundary. Only the
warning-aware worker module opts in, transaction-locally and without leaking its
stamp to later nested claims. Upgrading the DB library alone does not opt in.
Old workers fail closed for affected sessions; rollback after consent requires
compatible workers. Pause/Cancel and settlement remain available. This public gate
does not retrofit operator historical recovery that has no public consent receipt.
No cancellation/reaper protocol changes are included.

New Modal sessions persist `/workspace` with `snapshot_directory`: the restored
directory Image layers user files onto the currently selected sandbox environment/base
image instead of replacing the whole machine. Existing serialized sessions keep
their recorded `snapshot_filesystem` or tar mode and remain recoverable. Warm
checkpoint attempts use the configured interval as a hard minimum even after a
new mutation generation; an already-complete generation never calls the
provider again. The zero-holder drain/rotation capture bypasses that interval so
the exact latest generation is durable before teardown. It may also use the
separate `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_DRAIN_SNAPSHOT_TIMEOUT_MS` provider budget so a large
workspace can receive extended recovery headroom without lengthening ordinary
periodic or turn-end finalization. Unset preserves the shared snapshot timeout;
logical turn closure does not let the reaper reclaim the sole holder of an
already-admitted warm capture before its original capture deadline. Otherwise
the sweep could adopt a still-running finalizer's snapshot with the longer drain
budget. This bounded reclamation exception grants no execution or heartbeat
authority; settlement restores ordinary idle grace, and deadline expiry still
permits dead-worker capture recovery.
The worker's holder-liveness loop applies that same bounded physical-retention
rule when heartbeat authority rejects a closed attempt. It does not refresh the
closed holder, renew execution authority, or extend the capture deadline; the
finalizer releases after physical settlement. Epoch replacement and expired
captures still release promptly.
Migration 0497 repairs the global Modal orphan inventory for non-bypass migration
owners. Its private backend-PID/transaction read capability opens only inside the
inventory function, preserves cross-tenant warming/warm/draining attribution,
and closes before rows return. Direct runtime table reads remain tenant-scoped;
runtime cannot mint capabilities or gain DML through this repair. Fresh orphan
revalidation still protects matching instances and warming attributions whose
instance is not yet known; inventory read errors skip provider termination.
The append-only migration is rolling and atomic with an unchanged SQL signature.
Provision roles after migrating; never weaken RLS or use a broad owner bypass as
a fallback for an incomplete inventory.
Boot validation requires the larger configured capture budget, the legacy
command stop grace, and two reaper periods to fit strictly inside
provider-deadline rotation headroom even when the
default backend is no longer Modal, because historical Modal leases remain
durable across that rollout. The explicit drain budget is independently
rejected unless reaper dispatch, the full durable capture, and retry handoff fit
inside the caller/DB transition wait ceiling. Process-local configuration is
only the initial observational budget. Once an opted-in acquisition or mutation
waiter first sees a valid durable capture deadline, it may extend its wait once
using PostgreSQL's authoritative remaining `archive_capture_deadline_at` plus
retry-handoff grace, capped by the one-hour lifecycle ceiling. Later expired or
replacement capture claims cannot reset the wait or its grace. This honors an
older child's frozen input during a rolling timeout reduction without letting
repeated failed drain attempts starve a caller. Budget expiry returns the typed
capture fence; it grants no takeover, teardown, or writer admission authority.
Explicit zero-wait probes preserve their immediate fenced result.

Warm and drain capture failures share the bounded classifier in
`apps/worker/src/sandbox-snapshot-diagnostics.ts`. Structured diagnostics retain
an opaque lease key, epoch, closed provider error class/status, and the distinction
between an application capture deadline and a wrapped provider failure. Raw
provider messages, payloads and request IDs remain excluded. Logging failures
cannot replace the original capture failure or prevent exact-claim cleanup;
classification does not change retryability or grant teardown authority.

A rejected drain capture releases only its exact unpublished claim. This also
applies when the provider promise rejects after the local timeout: that detached
path cannot enter teardown, and release wakes waiters so they can re-arm the
intact live instance. The timeout alone never releases ownership. Late success
still publishes under the durable fence; publication or teardown failures retain
ownership, and an older failed callback cannot clear a replacement claim. A
provider-deadline/operator rotation is retained by the DB release operation.
Every fresh claim gets a new provider request ID; replacement attempts of an
uninterrupted claim retain its stored ID. A workflow retry after release and
intervening writes therefore cannot adopt an older snapshot as a newer generation.

Concurrent routed calls may all discover the same missing provider. Exactly one
observer wins the lease-loss transition; the others receive typed `superseded`
recovery. Each ambiguous operation is invoked at most once and is never replayed
on a replacement backend. In the winning loss transaction, every active
retained process on that exact lease epoch/provider is marked lost, all matching
open admissions are rejected, matching PTYs are closed, and only those process
holders are removed before the epoch advances. Terminal processes and every
other epoch/provider remain untouched. During idle drain, a resumable cloud box
is deleted only after a verified workspace capture is durably folded onto the
fenced lease. Definitive `NOT_FOUND` before capture preserves any existing
archive or records typed unrecoverable truth when no durable revision exists.

An older deployment may have committed the cold/advanced-epoch transition
before settling the exact lost-provider blocker rows. The exceptional operator
path is blocker-first: one DB-only, repeatable-read/read-only preview binds the
full account/workspace/session/group, lease/epoch/provider/route,
workspace/archive/verification tuple, fresh externally supplied provider-object
observation, and every process/admission/PTY/holder/interruption identity into a
`clrp1:` receipt. Unknown, incomplete, possible-writer, or mismatched truth
blocks. Apply accepts only that exact reviewed receipt, re-previews before and
under row locks, and settles the same narrow rows as the automatic loss
transaction. It never calls a provider, changes epoch/archive/recovery truth,
writes `/workspace`, or replays an ambiguous operation. The exact runbook is in
[`deployment.md`](deployment.md#cold-lost-provider-blocker-reconciliation).

Every operation that may mutate a persistable `/workspace` first enters one
lease-scoped turn/direct/process admission ledger. In one transaction, admission
binds the session group, warm lease epoch, provider identity, and pinned route to
the canonical turn attempt, an API request UUID held as `direct:<request UUID>`,
or an exact retained-process UUID held as `process:<process UUID>`, then
increments `workspace_generation` and inserts the operation row. The exact
provider promise is physically settled as `resolved` or `rejected`; a resolved
result then passes the matching authority/lease/provider/route acceptance fences
before its output is accepted. Only a turn admission can use authoritative
`session_turn_attempts.quiesced_at` for its exact attempt; direct and process
authority remain capture blockers until settled.

A yielded managed process first promotes its parent admission to retained state
and creates the non-TTL process holder before the internal provider locator can
leave the routing layer. The holder preserves exact cleanup authority while the
same shell tool continues its foreground wait. A command that proves terminal
during that wait returns inline and never becomes session background state.
Only providers whose process locator is controllable from another worker may
end that wait with a second, exact-attempt-fenced adoption transaction that
inserts its session-owned command row immediately before the model receives the
live locator. The SDK Local and Docker locators index an in-memory table on one
worker session object. After the bounded foreground wait, those providers return
an explicitly turn-scoped handle so the agent can test a running server. The
shell remains registered with the exact turn cancellation fence: ordinary
completion, Pause, Steer, and cancellation stop it and settle its process holder
before workspace capture. It is not registered as a session background command,
does not create terminal background notifications, and cannot be reused by a
successor attempt. Never wait for an indefinitely running server to exit before
returning control to its owning agent. A yielded
Connected Machine exec likewise creates its session-owned background-command
row before returning; that row freezes the physical control workspace,
enrollment, connection instance, and op ID. The exact parent admission,
process UUID, and provider locator or Connected Machine locator remain pinned
across active-pointer movement.
New background-command registrations retain the original command text separately
from their 512-character preview. Clipped previews end in an ellipsis; the UI
uses the complete text for hover and expansion. Existing rows without full text
fall back to their saved preview. Managed exec recovery preserves the original
command before any later read adopts the retained process.
Both provider paths serialize session adoption with Steer, Pause, terminal
Cancel, and session-tree deletion through the canonical workspace-control,
workspace, session, turn, and exact-attempt fence. Managed retention and session
adoption are deliberately separate so a provider's short yield is not mistaken
for a model-visible background command. For Connected Machines, the op-stream
yield path takes exact failure-cancellation authority before the adoption
transaction begins; if the fence rejects, that path exact-cancels the frozen op,
while a committed row transfers cancellation to session control and
reconciliation. This closes the post-commit/pre-unwind window in which attempt
cancellation could otherwise send `OpCancel` after durable adoption.
Model/user stdin is a separate process-owned mutation admission. Resize, EOF,
cancellation, helper exec, and drain polling are process control: they may prove
exit/loss but do not advance `workspace_generation`. Exact exit/loss atomically
settles the parent and process holder and closes any matching PTY; duplicate
identical proof is idempotent, while missing/conflicting proof keeps the fence
closed. Normal turn finalization drains only attempt-owned yielded shells before
workspace capture. Once a command's durable session adoption commits, normal
completion and Steer detach from it instead of cancelling it. Session/workspace
Pause and terminal Cancel atomically transition adopted commands to `stopping`;
provider-specific reconciliation then proves exact exit/loss before settlement.
Resume never revives a stopping command. Connected Machines and other
non-persistable routes do not dirty the provisioned cloud-home generation.

If an owner finalizer or worker dies before reaching that settlement, the sole
global lease reaper also runs a bounded, oldest-due reconciliation batch. A
direct owner or closed exact turn attempt makes a process eligible for provider
inspection only: owner/turn state, row age, timeout, and expired claim are never
physical-exit proof. The worker resumes the exact persisted provider envelope
and accepts only an exact SDK exit banner, exact provider-session-lost banner,
or structured provider-instance `NOT_FOUND`. It durably checkpoints that proof
before calling the same canonical settlement transaction, so a worker crash in
between can reclaim coordination without probing again. Running, malformed,
unsupported, identity-mismatched, timed-out, and transient provider results are
deferred without changing the process, admission, PTY, holder, lease, archive,
snapshot, or workspace generation. Settlement copies and fences the process
UUID, parent admission, process holder, lease/group, provider backend/instance,
lease epoch, route target/epoch, and provider session; exact replays are
idempotent and cannot touch a successor. This reconciliation never calls a
provider terminate/kill API and never captures or rotates a workspace snapshot.
Repeated Modal binding-missing or binding-mismatch observations enter a durable
24-hour reconciliation quarantine after five claimed probes. Quarantine is
only backoff: the process remains active, retains every blocker, carries no
exit/loss proof, and is periodically eligible for a later positive binding
lookup and ordinary reconciliation.
The app exports bounded owner-state/backlog, reconciliation, and expired-drain
metrics; dashboard/PromQL integration is coordinated separately.

Command reads expose `observationStatus: unavailable` when the exact retained
process cannot be observed; session aggregates expose `unavailableCount`.
The panel and sidebar distinguish that uncertainty from running or a requested
stop. Observation failure never invents terminal state, and definitive settlement
clears the unavailable projection.

Connected Machine background commands use the same proof-before-settlement
discipline without borrowing managed lease identity. The global maintenance pass
claims oldest-due rows with `SKIP LOCKED`, sends `OpQuery` for `running` or
idempotent `OpCancel` for `stopping` to the immutable launch subject with epoch
zero, and checkpoints the typed terminal provider observation before changing
the lifecycle row. Running, offline, timed-out, malformed, and successor-only
states remain active/deferred; connection retirement or elapsed time is not
physical proof and cannot license replay or rebinding.
The exact terminal transition is also the fallback agent-input boundary: changing the
command to `exited|lost` and appending `session.command.finished` commit
together. For a nonterminal session, one dedupe-keyed
`background_command_result` and `system.update.pending` join that transaction
unless command completion was already observed. A command completion registers
a workflow wake only for a current explicit session input wait. Otherwise the
result stays available without starting a model turn, including failures and
results queued before the preceding turn finished. Eligible new input can carry
compatible pending command results. Claim selects non-command input before
command notices and before the batch read limit, so command backlogs cannot
block later messages. Incompatible command notices remain pending. Human pause,
execution-authority boundaries and the batch size/byte limits still apply.
A successful agent-facing command read that reports `exited|lost` records
completion observation and suppresses a still-pending completion notification.
A running read does not observe future completion. Observation concerns terminal
status, not whether every output byte was read. Reads of arbitrary audit events
or redirected files do not acknowledge commands. Already-claimed notifications
may still arrive once; delivered history and earlier running tool receipts remain
unchanged. Observation happens while serving the read, without a separate
worker-history delivery handshake; a crash between observation and receipt
preservation is an accepted tradeoff.
A failed or cancelled session remains terminal and
keeps event-only command audit rather than reopening pending model input. A
failed transaction leaves the command unsettled so the same already-checkpointed
proof can retry; a duplicate proof cannot create a second result.
For a managed retained process, its process row, parent admission, process
holder, lease counts, linked command transition, event, model input, and wake
are one transaction. A notification failure therefore rolls the process back
to active with its provider proof intact; the reaper defers that exact proof and
never repeats provider execution.
`command_read` returns command-specific bounded retained output and current
status with a continuation cursor; reads work while running and after settlement,
subject to explicit retention limits. `command_wait` uses the same read path,
with output/terminal events as live hints rather than command-state authority.
Waits also recheck durable state once a second if a hint is missed. Sending
stdin is a separate capability, explicitly unsupported when the provider has no
interactive transport. A longer wait uses session-level `wait_for_input`,
whose timeout never cancels the command.

### Modal retained-command observation

A resumed Modal SDK session restores the sandbox but not adapter-local numeric
process handles. New commands use `modal-command-control.ts` and the verified
Modal 0.9.0 task-command-router RPC contract: the admitted workspace generation is
their route-scoped numeric alias, while opaque provider execution identity and
per-stream output cursors live in `sandbox_retained_processes.provider_command`.
Promotion commits the locator with process retention. API, worker, and reaper
readers adopt only the original sandbox identity. `modal-router-v1` stores a
client-generated execution UUID and independent stdout/stderr byte offsets.
Output and offsets commit in one expected-cursor transaction; an overlapping
reader discards its stale page and rereads before exposing a terminal receipt.
Bounded reads may stop inside a provider chunk and resume at the exact byte
offset. Split UTF-8 suffixes survive that boundary. Stdin reserves byte offsets
before dispatch; ambiguous sends never replay silently. Both streams must reach
EOF and authenticated provider polling must prove exit before settlement.
Sandbox files and printed status text are never
execution authority. Failed initial observation still retains a successful
start's locator; an ambiguous start is never automatically replayed.
Router access credentials remain in memory, use authenticated TLS, and are
renewed between operations. The narrow gRPC wire boundary preserves aborts and
does not retry mutations. Control-plane access uses a version-guarded
non-retrying middleware factory: Modal 0.9.0 otherwise drops abort signals for
streaming and retry-disabled calls. Cancelling observation is not process-exit proof;
the existing token/PGID cleanup fence still owns physical cancellation.

`modal-control-v1` is an explicit legacy reader for already launched commands;
new starts never select it. Its batch API does not guarantee full replay, so
historical missing output cannot be reconstructed or called complete. Never
reinterpret its `tp-` execution IDs or batch indices as router UUIDs/byte offsets.
The locator-schema rollout requires a maintenance worker cutover because old
readers cannot parse the new discriminator. After old active locators have
settled or passed the existing evidence-backed drain, remove the legacy live
reader; historical records remain immutable and do not authorize execution.

SDK-internal setup/readiness commands still use their original live SDK observer
and may yield. Their adapter-local aliases are above the admitted command range
(1–2147483647), so a setup process cannot collide with a retained command. Only
the same adapter can read those aliases; they cannot be bound as durable commands
or adopted by another reader. A missing retained alias never falls back to an
SDK process with a coincident numeric ID. Observation failure remains an error,
not command replay or exit proof.

For historical commands without that locator, the reaper reports
`process_observation_unavailable`, retaining the exact process/admission/holder.
After five probes it records `quarantined_process_observation_unavailable` and
rechecks after 24 hours through the existing reconciliation diagnostics/metrics.
A current owner's exact exit proof still settles immediately; independently
verified loss of the bound provider instance remains authoritative. Neither a
missing SDK map entry nor failure to recover terminal output proves command loss,
including when a completed entry aged out in its original adapter.

Observation backoff does not suppress provider-lifecycle checks during rotation.
An idle Modal lease held only by unobservable commands can enroll their exact
identities into the existing drain. Enrollment requires every attempt in the
sandbox group to be quiescent beyond idle grace, no other holders, and no child
mutation admissions. It fences new admission while preserving command records
and holders until provider termination. Capture excludes only enrolled parent
admissions and holders; checkpoint publication, termination, cold commit, and
durable wake remain owned by the existing lifecycle. Unknown commands settle
lost, never successful; a real exit arriving during drain retains its exit code.
Failed checkpoints retain the provider and command holders for retry. Filesystem
snapshots preserve neither running processes nor application transaction state.

For scheduled provider-deadline rotation, legacy commands have a separate
two-minute cancellation grace. A PTY receives one Ctrl-C; non-PTY stdin is not
a signal, so the worker records cancellation intent without writing Ctrl-C
bytes. After that grace, exact process holders may be enrolled even without
exit proof if the owner is closed and quiesced (or its direct request returned),
and no unrelated holder or mutation admission remains. An outstanding
reconciliation claim does not grant writer authority or block this deadline
capture. The provider is terminated only after the current workspace generation
is captured; remaining commands settle lost. Supervised commands keep their
separate proof gate. A prior explicit stop remains immutable; deadline intent
starts its own grace. This path does not apply to idle or operator rotation.

The same containment path covers an explicitly stopping managed command after
at least five provider-error observations. Its cancellation request and owner
quiescence must both predate idle grace; an absent quiescence receipt is not
accepted for this path. Provider errors alone never enroll a running command.
All sandbox-group activity, other-holder and child-admission exclusions remain
in force, and only verified provider termination settles an unknown result as
lost. A failed checkpoint leaves the provider and holders intact for retry.

Historical containment cannot reconstruct an execution ID the old adapter never
retained. A command whose owner cannot recover its terminal receipt remains a visible capture blocker;
operators must reconcile the exact command/provider identity rather than replay
unknown side effects or clear holders by age. No new process is launched by probing.


Migration 0419 records the exact launch turn, attempt, and execution generation
when either provider adopts a background command under the existing attempt
fence. Terminal results resolve that immutable receipt, copy only eligible
same-session successor delegations, and retain the causal human for normal
personal-resource admission. Legacy managed commands can prove the same tuple
through their retained process; legacy Connected Machine commands with no receipt
remain unattributed. A timeout similarly inherits its exact waiting turn.
Different causal turns claim separately. No path substitutes the newest human,
extends a once grant, or bypasses live revocation.

The existing exact-set pre-claim recovery can restore unconsumed root command
results and wait timeouts only after verifying their retained launch or timeout
receipt, completed causal human turn, failure frontier, and unchanged failed
update set. It repairs typed authority, preserves message/event content, and is
idempotent; it does not replay a previously accepted turn or recover a nested
session with parent-facing terminal truth.

Both command readers accept `commandId`, an optional opaque `cursor`,
`waitSeconds` (0–50; defaults 0 for read and 45 for wait), and `maxOutputBytes`
(4–65,536; default 16,384 UTF-8 output bytes). They return ordered stdout/stderr
chunks with `nextCursor` and `hasMore`, plus durable state and exit code. Keep the
cursor even on an empty running page. Retention metadata describes the stored
source and any detected gaps; unknown completeness and an empty page do not
prove that a command produced no output. Older output that was never persisted,
removed output, and oversized legacy events cannot be reconstructed by a read.
The API reads persisted output. In the live owning runtime, the trusted
first-party tool path authorizes through that API before refreshing the exact
owned command, then reads the newly retained output through the same API. Model
calls and Codemode use this path; third-party lookalike tools do not. Outside
that owning context, native reads and background reconciliation refresh the
stored snapshot. An empty running snapshot can therefore precede capture of
bytes already produced by the process.
If a live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure, the
runtime reauthorizes and rereads the API instead of discarding retained output.
A still-running result reports `freshness.status: "refresh_unavailable"` and
`retryable: true`; this is a freshness warning, not proof of command failure or
completion. No provider operation is retried by this fallback. Authorization,
consent, fencing, integrity, and unclassified errors still fail closed.

Typed runner failures are distinct from the process exit code: a runner may
report an output/spool failure alongside exit code zero. Migration 0417 adds
bounded `runner_failure` metadata to the command row so later reads and
completion notifications preserve that distinction after the live reader is
gone. Apply this rolling migration before starting readers that select the new
field; do not infer successful completion from exit code alone.

Repeated reads by the same live command client retain only an in-memory replay
frontier, incremental integrity state, and UTF-8 decoder state after successful
capture. They do not retain the full output prefix. Failed capture discards that
optimization and permits replay of retained truth; it grants no runner garbage
collection authority. A fresh client, including a new reconciliation claim,
still replays the retained prefix and performs idempotent capture. Its work is
proportional to retained command output, not bounded by the API output-page size.

Connected Machine capture preserves stream identity. SDK native readers can
return merged output; those retained chunks explicitly report merged stream
fidelity rather than reconstructing stdout/stderr. Local, Docker, and
OpenSandbox numeric process handles remain owning-context only: their process
maps are not durable recovery locators. Recoverable managed handles and
Connected Machine operations support background capture; missing or
provider-truncated bytes remain unrecoverable. Connected Machine has no stdin
transport, and OpenSandbox does not support arbitrary stdin.
The native `command_input` tool accepts the owning context's numeric
`session_id` and nonempty `chars`; it uses the existing fenced stdin mutation
path. It does not accept a durable command UUID or use history as input authority.

A successful first-party `wait_for_input` is an enforced production-runtime
boundary, not a request for the model to volunteer a final answer. The trusted
tool transport records acceptance in attempt-local control state; after the
tool batch settles, the runner returns without another model step. Canonical
tool receipts and parallel sibling results remain in history and the worker
uses ordinary turn settlement. Codemode shares the same trusted acceptance
state; stdout and third-party lookalike tools cannot request a yield. Failed
wait calls do not yield. Repeated accepted waits in the same logical turn keep
the first deadline and reason rather than renewing the wait, including across
attempt recovery. Acceptance is coordinated with provider dispatch and sealed
before terminal settlement. Calls racing an already-sealed dispatch are rejected
before the remote wait mutation. Only an actual runner yield suppresses a final
assistant message, never late acceptance alone. Failure settlement closes new
wait admission without waiting for stalled calls; already-running mutations
remain subject to durable attempt fencing. Compaction recovery may start a new
stream generation, but old callbacks cannot control its admission and pending
or accepted waits are retained across the retry. Durable input/deadline
arbitration remains in the existing session wait transaction and workflow;
this does not resume a paused session.

Teardown preserves that authority. Session-tree deletion locks and refuses any
`running` or `stopping` command before cascading session-owned rows. Workspace
deletion takes a separate transaction-scoped background-command advisory prefix
before parent rows; adoption takes the matching shared prefix for both the
owning workspace and a distinct physical control workspace. Active target or
origin references return a typed blocker. Settled cross-workspace origin history
is pruned only at the final successful source-workspace deletion boundary, in
the same transaction as the cascade; a deletion attempt blocked later by leases
or other durable owners leaves that history intact.

Capture preflight and archive fold block on every unsettled admission and live
direct/process holder in the closed write set. Publication is complete only when
that set is proven closed and `archive_generation === workspace_generation`.
Admission, ordinary settlement, and yielded-process promotion acquire the
canonical workspace/session/attempt-or-process prefix before the admission and
lease rows. A provider-terminal settlement retries only its idempotent database
transaction on PostgreSQL deadlock/serialization failure; it never reissues the
provider operation. This prevents one parallel completed command and one yielded
command from deadlocking, rolling back one settlement, and freezing checkpoint
capture behind an admission that is no longer physically running.
Late, concurrent, or replayed requests either remain blockers or are admitted
into a successor generation; no admitted operation is replayed after provider
rejection, provider loss, or a failed acceptance fence.

Terminal execution follows the same physical boundary. `terminalExec` does not
return a yielded process: success always carries a numeric `exitCode` and
`running: false`. Timeout or a non-timeout failure after yield first drains the
exact process group and settles retained authority; timeout cannot return while
the process or its durable admission remains live. PTY open returns only after
durable promotion and persistence of its exact process identity, and PTY close
leaves metadata open until exact exit/loss proof exists.

Migration `0117_sandbox_recovery_generations.sql` activates this protocol as a
one-way maintenance cutover. Stop all old API, control-worker, and turn-worker
writers first. A live `opengeni_app` session rejects activation with SQLSTATE
`55000` and the transaction rolls back cleanly. Application/image rollback to an
old writer is permitted only before activation; after activation no old writer
may restart, because there is no mixed-version or down-migration path.

**Worker restarts are survivable.** A graceful worker shutdown (a deploy or
rollout restart delivers SIGTERM; Temporal cancels in-flight activities with
reason `WORKER_SHUTDOWN`) checkpoints conversation truth and the sandbox
envelope, closes the exact attempt as recoverable, and leaves the same logical
turn in `recovering`. It never creates a human queue row or synthetic user
message. Any in-flight side-effecting tool call is durably closed with an
explicit `interrupted / outcome unknown` result before the next attempt can
run; this includes Codemode calls, whose operation is journaled before dispatch
and whose execution-start marker prevents replay after the side-effect boundary.
A late result is retained only as rejected evidence. The workflow then
creates a fresh attempt for that same turn on a healthy worker and reconstructs
model input from durable model history and tool-call lineage. At most the
single in-flight model step is lost, the same bound as a crash. This is an
explicit checkpoint/resume, not an automatic Temporal retry. A newer control
revision, terminal state, or successor attempt wins instead of being
overwritten.

The shared worker process owns its own fatality policy. The pinned Agents SDK
is patched so its MCP lifecycle queue settles every submitted command even when
an internal error value is hostile, and its tracing provider does not register
process-global `unhandledRejection` termination behavior. No SDK background
promise may escape into the process boundary. The worker listener remains an
observational last resort; a genuinely unhealthy worker stops polling and uses
the normal drain path rather than letting a dependency call `process.exit(1)`.

An active-route filesystem-root change uses the same durable same-logical-turn
boundary. A machine-primary attempt never pre-leases home. Clearing its pointer
to managed home emits `home_unavailable_this_turn`; swapping to a route whose
manifest root differs, or reconnecting the selected machine under a different
effective Hello root, emits `workspace_root_changed_this_turn` before another
provider operation is dispatched. Failure settlement durably reconciles
completed model/tool truth, closes only the unresolved tool suffix, records
`sandbox_route_transition`, and returns `recovering`. The next attempt starts
from the committed pointer and binds one exact root for its lifetime. There is
no new user message, per-turn machine cwd query, silent fallback, path
reinterpretation, or blind replay of an ambiguous operation.

Approval-gated MCP execution has an additional provider-side-effect fence.
Connection-backed actions and legacy per-session MCP servers configured with
`requireApproval` both create a durable action request keyed by the logical turn
and approval id before invocation. Argument-sensitive prepare, begin, and
completion for both classes are owned by the canonical attempt gateway used by
model MCP and Codemode; an approval-wrapped MCP adapter without that exact
attempt gateway fails before provider execution. Dedicated GitHub and Google Drive adapters classify
provider outcomes but do not register a second policy lifecycle. The approved
transition admits the provider once; a replay after execution started is recorded
as outcome-unknown, and a replay after completion is rejected as already executed.
Recovery may therefore re-enter the SDK approval step without issuing the MCP
request again.

The Codemode dispatcher renews its operation claim during gateway preparation,
not only after the execution marker. Its visible `agent.toolCall.created` event
uses a deterministic per-operation client event id, so reclaiming an expired
pre-execution claim reuses one durable timeline entry before the replacement
claimant crosses the execution boundary. During a rolling upgrade it also
recognizes the exact unkeyed event written by a predecessor worker.

Root-task-tree note tools follow that same no-ambiguous-replay boundary. Their
operation receipts bind the exact accepted turn, attempt, execution generation,
root tree, and input. The same attempt/input may replay its durable receipt, but
a recovered successor attempt cannot claim or reissue the predecessor's
operation UUID. Notes remain an explicit retrieval surface and are never
composed into recovery history or ordinary prompts. See
[`company-brain-write-routing.md`](company-brain-write-routing.md).

Resource-based turn workers use that exact graceful path only as emergency
memory protection. Temporal's cgroup-aware slot tuner closes new admission at
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_TARGET_MEMORY_USAGE`; reaching that target is ordinary
backpressure and does not restart a worker. An admitted long-running turn can
still retain native or external memory afterward. After each terminal model
response is durably reconciled into exact conversation truth, the worker
schedules one process-wide forced GC on a later task when JavaScript heap or
external memory has reached 512 MiB. Concurrent response checkpoints coalesce,
and collection runs at most once per 30 seconds. This does not trim history,
recycle the worker, or restart an activity: active turns and all exact context
they still own remain strongly reachable while completed request serialization
and stream buffers can be reclaimed. The worker also samples the
most pressured finite process cgroup or ancestor, falling back to whole-host
`MemAvailable` only without a finite cgroup. Process RSS pressure receives a
bounded asynchronous GC opportunity first. Only if the authoritative scope
stays at or above the separate
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_EMERGENCY_MEMORY_USAGE`
for `OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_MEMORY_GUARD_SUSTAIN_MS`, the worker stops polling via
its ordinary lifecycle drain; the sampling cadence is
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_MEMORY_GUARD_INTERVAL_MS`. This is neither an activity
timeout nor a hard kill: conversation truth, pending side-effect receipts, and
outcome-unknown settlement retain the same authority described above, and a
replacement worker recovers the same logical turn without replaying an
ambiguous provider operation. The emergency threshold is constrained above the
maximum admission target. Fixed-concurrency and control workers do not run the
guard.

**Ungraceful worker death is also survivable — bounded, never blind.** A hard
kill (SIGKILL, OOM, node loss, a rollout whose grace period expired) never
runs the graceful checkpoint; it surfaces to the session workflow as a
heartbeat-timeout `ActivityFailure` carrying the exact dead activity id. The
workflow does not fail the session independently for that shape: conversation
truth was still dual-written after every model response during the turn, so
the fenced `recoverTurnAfterWorkerDeath` activity atomically closes the lost
attempt, marks the same
logical turn `recovering` and the loop dispatches its next attempt. This is not
prompt-queue work and not an automatic Temporal retry of side-effectful work:
the resumed attempt sees everything durably checkpointed, including explicit
`interrupted / outcome unknown` tool results when an effect cannot be proven.
The dying activity never writes a competing cancellation or authoritative late
result.
A per-turn redispatch counter persisted on the turn row (ceiling 3) breaks
crash loops: the transaction that exceeds the ceiling appends the failure
events and fails the exact turn/session, and the workflow performs no second
split failure settlement.

**Try again retains the failed logical turn.** `POST
/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/retry` and SDK
`retrySession(workspaceId, sessionId, request)` require `sessions:control` and
the normal session-authorization seam. The request binds `clientEventId` to
`failureEventId`, with optional `model`, `reasoningEffort`, and `latencyMode`.
Clients retain that operation key and payload after a lost response. Success
returns `{ outcome: "accepted" | "replayed", turnId, failureEventId }`.

The activity-gated transaction checks the exact latest failure, active control,
and absence of live attempts, unresolved writers, pending tools, or retained
unknown tool outcomes. It reserves a durable receipt, updates only the failed
turn's execution selection/status, appends recovery audit events, and registers
a workflow wake atomically. It preserves the prompt, trigger, immutable authority,
goal snapshot, and canonical conversation/tool history. A never-claimed human
prompt becomes queued so ordinary first claim inserts its original history item
once; a started turn becomes recovering, and ordinary claim increments its
execution generation without inserting another user message. Completed tool
results are not replayed. Model selection remains subject to current model,
billing, provider-compaction, and retained execution-authority boundaries.

Stale failures, unresolved execution, and deliberate pauses return distinct 409
conflicts. Retry never resumes a paused workstream. Failures with no retained
logical turn and settled scheduled occurrences fail closed as unsupported;
idle credit exhaustion is not a failed-session retry boundary. A committed
operation replays before mutable model/billing checks, even after work advances.

A genuinely new `user.message` can still transition failed → queued and start a
new turn from stored history. This is a different intent from Try again, and
clients must not manufacture such a message for retry. Only `cancelled` — an
explicit terminal Cancel — is irreversible.

Every transaction that creates or re-enables workflow work also increments the
session's durable wake revision. An active goal has a second, goal-owned
monotonic wake/observed pair: terminal settlement advances it in the same
transaction as the workflow wake, and continuation materialization observes it
only alongside the typed update, event pair, usage fact, session transition,
and successor workflow wake. Single-target producers signal directly;
recursive controls trigger the bounded dispatcher once without loading the
affected tree into API memory. Successful delivery acknowledges the exact
revision, and the dispatcher retries only due unacknowledged rows.
Temporal is therefore a nudge, never the work ledger, and a commit/signal crash
cannot strand the prompt. Repaired wakes inspect unsettled exact-attempt
interruptions so a live Pause/Steer still reaches settlement. The workflow
records a monotonic signal version before its final activity chain and refuses to
return when a signal arrived during that chain, closing the completion race.

## Goals — what makes long runs continue

Agents stop prematurely. A **goal** flips the default so terminal settlement of
the last turn arms one durable Postgres continuation obligation and the agent
must explicitly `goal_complete` or `goal_pause` to stop. A locked transaction
materializes one revision as one typed goal-continuation update, its audit
events and usage fact, the exact latest finished causal turn plus its personal
delegation snapshot, and the next workflow wake. The stable
`goal-continuation:<goalId>:wake:<revision>` identity makes a lost commit
response/retry a no-op rather than another logical continuation. The update
joins the next bounded internal batch and never appears as a human queue row.

Queued human input and Steer always win; approval, same-turn recovery,
provider-capacity wait, recursive Pause, and cancellation block synthesis.
Temporal activity failure records a delayed outbox wake and may close the
workflow; `signalWithStart` later reconstructs delivery from Postgres without a
human message or model polling. A dead worker may re-dispatch the same logical
goal turn under a new fenced attempt, but cannot materialize or bill another
continuation. The goal API projects scheduled/running/blocked/invariant-broken
from one repeatable snapshot so UI state never guesses from `active` or `idle`.
Agent `goal_update` is itself a revisioned command: its stable operation key is
target-scoped across replacement attempts, while the receipt retains the
original attempt for audit. Receipt/result, goal version, session-sequenced
event, and mutation commit atomically. A lost response can therefore be
reconciled from a recovered attempt without double-applying the update, and an
old replay returns its stored result rather than overwriting newer goal truth.
Consecutive continuations that consumed no external input are paced by a
delayed workflow-wake row (`goal_idle_backoff`), never by a Temporal timer or a
cap; any new input pulls that wake to now, and the claim that binds a goal turn
to a batch carrying other machine input restarts the no-input streak.
Full detail in `docs/goals.md`; goals are bounded by budget/admission policy and
explicit lifecycle control, not an inferred progress score.

## Conversation, audit history and retained Knowledge

A session's content lives in three places. Keep them straight; reaching for the
wrong one is the classic mistake.

Application-provided `modelContext` follows the same rule: it is ordinary
model-visible user-role content attached to one accepted message, not a system
or developer instruction. Initial, queued Send/Steer, realtime delegation, and
finalized transcript handoff all converge on the same canonical history shape.
Because the newest message carries the changing bytes, persistent
`Agent.instructions` and earlier history remain prompt-cache stable. Public
turn/queue projections and the standard timeline omit the field; full event and
audit reads may return it, so it is never a secret boundary.

1. **`session_history_items` — conversation truth (the model-facing store).**
   Ordered, protocol-preserving SDK `AgentInputItem` JSON, exact for accepted
   content and RLS-scoped. Token-shaped strings, headers, assignments, URLs,
   PEM-looking text, and configured-secret-shaped strings are never classified
   or rewritten. A new turn's
   input is built from this store. Ordered PostgreSQL `json` columns preserve
   object-key order, with trigger-synchronized `jsonb` projections for existing
   SQL queries. The pending-call ledger uses the same representation. Reads use
   normal JSON decoding without sorting or another database round trip. Legacy
   rows retain their already-normalized order. It is dual-written as the agent streams
   (reconciled after every model response and at every turn-end path) so a crash
   loses at most the single in-flight model call. Ordinary inference has no
   second conversation-memory read path. At this persistence boundary only,
   JavaScript SDK object properties whose value is `undefined` are treated as
   absent, matching their JSON wire meaning; arrays and every other non-JSON
   graph fail closed with the exact offending path. Historical inline image and
   screenshot items remain backward-compatible model history. New
   `computer_screenshot` and `view_image` typed PNG/JPEG/WebP bytes are validated
   and retained inside the tool invocation, before its result can enter live SDK
   history. The later SDK event only projects the established receipt, so
   event/state ordering cannot expose inline bytes to reconciliation. Every new
   history copy receives the deterministic bounded artifact receipt (or an
   explicit unavailable fact), never the provider object key or re-encoded
   base64 source.
   Function-transport `view_image` also validates the declared data-URL type
   against those supported magic bytes before constructing structured model
   image content. Unsupported or mismatched bytes return a concise conversion
   instruction as the tool result, so they cannot become a provider-level
   invalid-image request.
   New generated images follow the same no-inline-byte rule but are permanent
   workspace files: native hosted base64 is retained before serialization and
   adapter tools return the same compact `generated_image` receipt. A later
   model request projects that receipt to a deterministic artifact fact without
   provider identity, signed URLs, object keys, or base64. See
   [`image-generation.md`](image-generation.md).
   Model-visible tool results stay at or below 1 MiB. Overflow is a successful
   tool: exact serialized bytes become a workspace File, a current-turn copy
   lands at `tool-results/<operationId>.json` relative to the shell cwd (the
   durable rematerialization path remains the virtual
   `/workspace/tool-results/<operationId>.json`), and history/events keep the
   compact `{ sandboxPath, fileId, byteSize, mediaType }` receipt whose
   `sandboxPath` is that cwd-relative shell path. Later turns do not
   rematerialize; retrieve old bytes through Files MCP plus shell. Spill write
   failure is a bounded `result_too_large` error and never puts the huge payload
   in history.
   Codemode callers skip the 1 MiB cap; the existing 16 MiB journal cap on
   `session_attempt_codemode_calls` is unchanged. See
   `packages/runtime/src/tool-result-spill.ts` and
   `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/tool-result-spill.ts`.
   User attachment rows store stable file references, not inline bytes. Active
   messages reconstruct the same authorized receipt and supported image content
   across turns and before compaction. File metadata is batch-authorized once
   per turn and bytes are memoized; object reads have bounded concurrency.
   Historical images do not cause sandbox remounts. Each image retains the
   existing inline admission limit; adding an image does not evict older images.
   Before blob reads, a 64 MiB raw-image transport limit bounds both accumulated
   per-turn bytes and repeated images in each request. Exceeding it fails the
   turn explicitly without altering history; compaction cannot bypass it.
   Such histories require a smaller conversation or a fork before the heavy
   messages until a streaming image transport exists.
   Missing/corrupt eligible bytes fail preparation rather than silently changing
   context. Compaction preserves images in retained messages and charges their
   projected token cost. Its omitted-file catalog is reference-only, so it does
   not rehydrate images from messages deliberately replaced by compaction.
2. **`agent_run_states` — requires-action sentinel plus control snapshots.**
   Pauses flush completed-pair history, then persist the bounded open suffix
   on `session_pending_tool_calls` (the pending call item, tied reasoning the
   sanitizer would drop, and interruption kind). Unpaired calls never enter
   model-facing `session_history_items`. The same settlement writes the
   open-suffix sentinel into `agent_run_states` with pending-approval /
   human-input snapshots. Resume settles one suffix member
   (human-input response, approval invoke through the existing MCP execute-once
   fence, or rejection), promotes reasoning + call + bounded result as one pair,
   and either stays `requires_action` without a model call or continues from
   history. Before that continued model call, the exact resumed attempt
   idempotently attaches machine input inside its frozen pending-event sequence
   boundary, after the paired result in canonical history; input accepted later
   remains pending for the next turn. Missing suffix rows fail closed. It does
   not reconstruct SDK `RunState`.
   Historical sandbox envelopes receive one exact-path compatibility repair before
   SDK validation: invalid non-record `exposedPorts` values are removed only from
   the root and `sessionsByAgent[*]` session envelopes, while provider state and
   every unrelated RunState field remain intact. Provider predeclared-port arrays
   stay in provider state and are never emitted as SDK endpoint records.
   Do not use it as conversation memory.
3. **`session_events` — the exact human/audit timeline for accepted payloads.**
   Append-only, per-session sequence numbers, drives replay/SSE/UI. Event content
   is never secret-scanned or rewritten. Full REST reads, compact text-delta
   batches, SSE, and browser chat preserve that content, including long messages
   and tool outputs. Pagination and loaded-history windows select whole events;
   they never replace content with omission markers. Explicit monitoring
   previews remain separately bounded and must not be reused as full messages.
   A newly retained `computer_screenshot` event instead carries only its closed
   session artifact receipt after settlement succeeds, or a typed unavailable
   reason if validation, quota, or storage could not establish that receipt.
   Events remain a separate timeline and must never be used to
   reconstruct the target session's model conversation. A manager can inspect an
   independently bounded cross-session monitoring projection as ordinary tool
   output; that does not turn audit events into conversation truth.

Retained screenshots have a separate database/object lifecycle, not a fourth
conversation store. Preparation creates a deterministic pending file/artifact
pair and reserves exact workspace bytes. Verified provider settlement moves
`quota_state` from `reserved` to `ready` once; duplicate settlement replays the
same ready row. Session, turn, and attempt deletion use nullable `SET NULL`
references plus `cleanup_queued`, preserving the object, file row, and charged
quota until maintenance owns cleanup. Generic file deletion is restricted while
the lifecycle row exists.

The global bounded reaper claims stale pending, expired ready, and queued
cleanup rows with an exact UUID. A reconcile observation that is missing or
mismatched must first atomically promote that exact claim to `cleanup_pending`;
only then may it issue the idempotent provider delete. If a concurrent writer
settles the artifact ready, settlement clears the claim, promotion fails, and
the reaper cannot delete the live key. Terminal completion releases the
artifact's explicit reserved/ready quota bucket idempotently. Detached-session
cleanup removes the lifecycle and file rows only after provider deletion; a
late PUT racing parent deletion is compensated by deleting the now-unowned key.
Authenticated session artifact routes expose sanitized metadata and one bounded
range at a time, and the SDK verifies assembled length and SHA before React
renders an object URL.

Generated images have a separate permanent workspace-file lifecycle. Adapter
provider calls first cross a durable prepared/provider-started fence; after the
provider may have run, recovery may finish an existing deterministic upload but
must not repeat generation. Native hosted generation stays inside the ordinary
model-call crash boundary. Successful bytes are validated and retained once,
then materialized into the active sandbox for that turn. Historical receipts do
not trigger later eager copies; an agent retrieves the workspace file explicitly
when needed. A sandbox-copy failure never invalidates the permanent artifact or
replays paid work. Canonical:
[`image-generation.md`](image-generation.md).

Structured human input adds a durable control checkpoint, not a fourth memory
store. When the built-in `request_human_input` tool interrupts a run, the same
transaction stores its request rows, the open-suffix pending-tool receipts,
the `agent_run_states` sentinel, the `requires_action` projection, and
requested events. The request row is
owned by the exact turn execution generation; its creation attempt is only
provenance. Answer, allowed skip, expiry, or cancellation is first-writer-wins
and becomes structured output for that same SDK tool call. It never becomes a
synthetic queue row or `user.message`. A replay-safe workflow timer settles
expiry, Pause preserves the pending interruption, and permanent replacement
settles it as cancelled. Canonical: [`human-input.md`](human-input.md).

Cross-session monitoring is tail-first and selected in PostgreSQL. With no
cursor, REST/SDK/MCP monitoring omits raw message, reasoning, command-output,
and PTY deltas, uses `summary` payloads, and returns exact covered-sequence and
continuation facts. Type filters and the `control`, `terminal`, `failure`,
`checkpoint`, `tool_receipt`, and `provider_account` semantic classes share one
union-then-subtract algebra; explicit exclusions win, while an explicit include
can opt a type back in from the monitoring defaults. `latest` is instead an
exclusive typed newest lookup: it cannot be combined with include/exclude type
or class filters, so its requested class cannot be unioned away or subtracted.
Explicit forensic REST/SDK
pages can return the exact retained audit projection, but remain count/byte
bounded and cannot recover source bytes that the audit boundary omitted. The
MCP result is separately capped to 64 KiB of exact pretty-printed JSON and never
advances a cursor over an event it did not return.

Session discovery is a separate compact monitoring projection, not a list of
full session rows. `sessions_list` defaults to deterministic descending
`(created_at, id)` order and can instead use the durable descending
`(activity_revision, updated_at, id)` activity order. `updated_at` is the
display/keyset suffix, not the snapshot clock. Revision zero is the untouched
legacy bucket and still traverses by exact PostgreSQL timestamp/UUID suffix.
Both paths use opaque, versioned, snapshot-bound keyset cursors and matching
workspace-prefixed indexes. The workspace activity counter is created with the
workspace, so an updated-order page reads its complete multi-query projection
through one short read-only repeatable-read MVCC snapshot and never takes a
counter or workspace-control lock. The page returns that decimal snapshot as
`updatedThrough`; the next incremental scan passes it as
`updatedAfter`, so application-clock timestamps, equal timestamps, inserts,
and repeated updates cannot create a handoff gap. Semantic writers acquire only
their domain locks while doing work. Their outermost database wrapper opens one
workspace-scoped activity gate, lets row triggers tag the changed session set
with the current full transaction id, settles every deferred constraint, and
then finalizes exactly once: one counter increment and one shared revision
stamped onto exactly that transaction's pending sessions. Low-level session
writers accept only the branded gate handle, while the SQL trigger catches raw
or stale callers at runtime. The finalizer clears the pending set in the same
transaction. A zero-change
transaction leaves the counter untouched; a semantic writer outside a matching
gate, a conflicting nested workspace, a manual revision write, or an open gate
without its finalizer fails closed and rolls back. A new gate must begin at the
outer transaction boundary; same-workspace nested scopes reuse that owner, while
an unrelated outer transaction is rejected. The counter therefore enters
the lock graph only after other transaction work is complete, while discovery
never enters that graph at all. Raw deltas do not mark a session pending. Known
targets should be read with exact-ID `session_get`, whose model-facing
projection independently bounds every aggregate and the complete pretty-printed
response to 64 KiB; the REST session detail contract remains unchanged.

`sessions.updated_at` records semantic monitoring activity time, while
`sessions.activity_revision` is its transactional monotonic ordering fact; raw
stream volume advances neither. A batch containing only raw message, reasoning,
sandbox-command-output, or PTY
deltas advances `last_sequence` but does not advance `updated_at` or
`activity_revision`. A semantic event or explicit session mutation advances
the timestamp, marks that session pending inside the activity gate, and shares
the transaction's single finalized workspace revision with every other changed
session. This keeps
updated-order discovery useful even while a productive session emits a large
raw token or terminal stream; `session_events` remains the exact sequenced
audit path for those retained previews.

Provider bookkeeping is not an explicit session mutation for this purpose:
workspace Codex source changes, automatic policy pins, and recording the last
used Codex credential preserve both activity fields. A human's explicit
in-session account switch still counts, as do the ordinary turn/message events.
Migration 0426 corrects the workspace affinity-reset trigger without rewriting
historical activity. Retained events cannot reconstruct every legitimate
non-event session edit, so historical recency repair requires explicit reviewed
candidates rather than an automatic global backfill.

Operation-keyed session commands retry only their rolled-back database
transaction on PostgreSQL deadlock or serialization SQLSTATEs, with a bounded
attempt count. Durable operation receipts make those retries idempotent;
publication and workflow wake delivery remain strictly after commit and are
never replayed by the database retry loop. Terminal persistence errors expose a
fixed safe message plus structured diagnostics while retaining the exact driver
failure only as the internal cause.

Those durable stores are still not the realtime or browser representation.
NATS chunks bounded notifications; session SSE always re-reads canonical events
from Postgres rather than rendering those notification previews. Each SSE body
queues at most one complete frame, retains one latest-wins
live notification, and uses bounded-page Postgres replay/gap fill. If a second
write sees non-positive `desiredSize` for 30 seconds, the API errors only that
connection, releases its upstream subscription, and records a fixed-label bound
metric; reconnect resumes from the client's last observed durable sequence.
REST uses byte-targeted forward prefixes/backward suffixes; an oversized event
travels intact and alone in a page or frame, so it cannot strand its cursor. And
React retains one direction-aware count+byte window. Live/default accumulation
keeps the newest suffix. If backward paging retains an older prefix and evicts
the live tail, the hook aborts that iterator and reconnects from the retained
high-water mark, replaying the evicted tail before appending newer live rows.
Its highest-ever-observed sequence and latest status are stored separately from
that rewindable resume cursor. A single event exceeding the browser byte target
is retained alone rather than shortened or dropped. Model tool-output budgets
and explicit diagnostic summaries are independent of this full-content contract.
Previously lost source bytes cannot be reconstructed from omission markers.

Workspace-control events follow a smaller independent contract because they are
cursor invalidations, not evidence or conversation history. Human reason input
is limited to 8 KiB UTF-8 (and cannot contain NUL), authenticated actor ids are
limited to 1 KiB, and the durable event is at most 16 KiB with explicit original /
delivered / omitted byte facts for guarded historical or direct-writer values.
The generic full value was not retained. NATS asserts a 32-KiB message, SSE uses
the same one-frame connection queue, and REST pages use a separate 1-MiB
byte envelope plus the last delivered sequence as the resume cursor. Replaying
one guarded poison row must still advance to every later durable revision.

Sandbox recovery state is persisted separately again. The group lease owns the
authoritative provider/archive/restore/workspace projection and epoch;
`sandbox_session_envelopes` stores the small per-session provider/manifest
descriptor used to reattach and can supply a legacy archive only through the
lease's atomic revision-selection step. Both are decoupled from the RunState
blob. The current artifact's `archive_generation` remains the immutable capture
boundary while later tool admissions advance `workspace_generation`. Global
holder reconciliation claims a bounded lease-first `SKIP LOCKED` batch before
it deletes stale holders or recomputes counts, so an in-flight acquire is
deferred to the next sweep rather than overwritten from a pre-wait snapshot.

See issue #35 for the rationale and the dual-write → flagged-read → default-flip
migration history.

One consequence of client-side conversation truth: model calls must not depend
on the provider's server-side response store. Provider-assigned item ids
(`rs_`/`msg_`/`fc_`…) are resolved against that store, and a response that
streamed successfully can be missing from it on the very next call, failing a
long run mid-turn with 400 "Item with id … not found". The runtime therefore
strips provider item ids from every model-call input by default
(`OPENGENI_OPENAI_PROVIDER_ITEM_IDS=strip`) and round-trips
`reasoning.encrypted_content` instead
(`OPENGENI_OPENAI_REASONING_ENCRYPTED_CONTENT=true`), so requests are
self-contained and reasoning continuity does not hinge on provider storage.
New history rows omit Responses output-only item `status` at persist
(`canonicalizePersistedHistoryItem`); pairing is `call_id`. The Codex
subscription fetch still strips leftover item `status` on the wire for
already-stored SuperGrok rows and mid-turn SDK items because the
ChatGPT/Codex input schema 400s `Unknown parameter: 'input[N].status'`. That
strip is request-local and does not rewrite stored history. Hosted tool calls
(web/file search, code interpreter and image generation) retain their actual
`status` at both boundaries because it is required replay data, not an
output-only annotation. Missing historical evidence is not invented or
backfilled by normalization.
If Codex nevertheless rejects that exact opaque artifact with its recognized
HTTP-400 encrypted-content family, the current attempt atomically marks only
the exact active reasoning/compaction row IDs and the current turn's latest
RunState receipt containing opaque artifacts that participated in the rejected
request as provider-invalid.
Their durable rows, readable content, provenance, and timeline truth remain
intact. Recovery then reclaims the same logical turn with a new attempt and
builds one temporary input view that omits or neutralizes only that rejected
identity; an unusable remote-compaction blob is omitted because no portable
plaintext exists. Credential identity is irrelevant. A generic 400, a different
provider error, or a rejection that invalidates none of that exact candidate set is terminal
rather than an equivalent retry loop.

The family is recognized either by the exact provider code
`invalid_encrypted_content` or by the decrypt/parse sentence family, and the
remote-compaction request is in scope: `shouldRecoverCompactionProviderFailure`
lets a `CompactionProviderResponseError` carrying that rejection reach the same
invalidation settlement instead of settling `context_compaction_failed`, because
the compaction request sends the same opaque artifacts as the ordinary request
that preceded it.

Every other definitive provider rejection of the compaction request (HTTP 400,
413, or 422) remains terminal, but it is no longer opaque. The worker persists a
closed `providerRejection` record on both the `turn.failed` payload and the
`session.context.compaction.skipped` landmark: `httpStatus`, the provider
`type` and `code`, the rejected `param` path (for example
`input[12].encrypted_content`), and the provider request id. The provider
message is never persisted because it can quote conversation input. The failure
text names those identifiers and states that repeating the request fails the
same way until the conversation changes; the timeline's compaction pill shows
the same identifiers instead of the generic "request it again to retry" copy,
which only applies to a transient failure.

Subscription, model, and provider-route changes never alter canonical history
or a saved approval RunState. Responses consumes canonical history directly;
Chat Completions receives one request-local transcript projection only for item
types its wire protocol cannot represent. Historical `tool_search` and other
tool call/output pairs are completed facts, not authorization to execute again.
The projection is discarded after the request. Portable sessions may switch
between supported providers; `remote_v2` sessions remain Codex-only.

## Agent-loop request lifecycle observability

The user-visible startup critical path is also durable and phase-specific. The
existing `turn.queued`/`turn.started`, `sandbox.operation.*`, `rig.setup.*`, and
`agent.model.request` events reconstruct queueing, box establishment, sandbox environment,
repository/file work, and provider first byte. Compact
`turn.startup.phase.started|completed|failed` checkpoints fill the two gaps for
tool connection and model-request preparation; terminal payloads contain only a
closed phase name and non-negative `durationMs`. In particular, lazy
`sandbox.provision` completes as soon as the box is established, before owned
sandbox environment/repository/file setup, so “Starting sandbox” never absorbs unrelated work.
Model-request preparation is an enclosing span: it begins when control enters
the runtime and ends at the provider transport boundary, so it may include the
sandbox, sandbox environment, repository, and other setup rows whose starts appear below it.
The timeline labels that overlap explicitly instead of presenting the parent as
an additional sequential wait.

The periodic warm-workspace snapshot is mid-session durability. The lease
heartbeat must not start it until the first provider request has reached its
transport boundary: before then there is no agent-produced work to protect, and
the snapshot's workspace fence would make first-request sandbox preparation
wait behind maintenance. Turn-end capture and the existing single-flight gate
remain unchanged.

Fleet metrics keep this drill-down identity-free:
`opengeni_turn_worker_preparation_duration_seconds` measures the platform path,
`opengeni_turn_startup_phase_duration_seconds` attributes its bounded operations,
and `opengeni_turn_startup_milestone_duration_seconds` records real cumulative
queue, provider-dispatch, and first-byte SLO samples from the durable turn queue
timestamp. Their labels are limited to the closed provider/backend/outcome and,
where applicable, phase/count/cache vocabularies; session, turn, request,
credential, and content values remain only in authenticated durable events.
Operation durations can nest and overlap; summing them does not produce a
critical path. `runtime_stream_initialization` measures the enclosing runtime
entry, not provider network dispatch. Background MCP connection/catalog work
starts immediately but does not gate the first request; its measurements use
`opengeni_tool_background_preparation_duration_seconds` instead of startup
phases. Required and best-effort connections can also run concurrently.
The database returns a milestone receipt only when the current transaction
inserted the first canonical current-association checkpoint, so ordinary
attempt recovery and callback replay cannot deterministically double-count it.
That decision is a per-turn ledger, `session_turn_startup_milestones` (one row
per turn, milestone, outcome; migration 0318): the event-append or settlement
transaction performs `insert ... on conflict do nothing returning` for each
checkpoint it inserted, and only a returned row is a receipt, measured from the
turn's durable `created_at` to the canonical event's own `occurred_at`. It
never re-reads the turn's `session_events` rows, so the cost is O(1) per model
request instead of O(events in the turn) inside the transaction that holds the
workspace inference-control row. The terminal failed first-byte outcome is
fenced on ledger state (a provider-dispatch row exists and no completed
first-byte row exists). A turn whose `turn.started` was already durable before
a ledger-aware writer touched it (in flight across the ledger rollout) is
sealed once with `pre_ledger_history` sentinel rows after one bounded probe for
an earlier current `turn.started`, and emits no further startup receipts rather
than re-observing a checkpoint with a duration equal to its age.
A terminal `turn.failed` after provider dispatch contributes one bounded failed
first-byte sample only when the logical turn produced no canonical byte in any
attempt. A recoverable pre-byte attempt and a later tool-loop failure after a
byte therefore cannot downgrade the logical startup outcome; successful
first-byte latency remains a separate completed series. Prometheus observation
is still an in-process, at-most-once side effect after the database commit: a
process crash in that COMMIT-to-observe window can lose a sample. It is not
transactionally exactly-once; a replica-safe Postgres-backed metrics projector
would be a separate observability architecture.

Provider request lifecycle diagnostics are synchronous, bounded, and best-effort. Codex reports `headers`, `first_byte`, and one semantic `terminal` phase; SuperGrok reports the equivalent `headers`, first valid SSE event, and terminal phases plus valid-event count/gap telemetry. Terminal outcomes are `completed`, `failed`, or `timed_out`. The worker maps these to `opengeni_model_request_phases_total{provider,phase,outcome}` and `opengeni_model_request_phase_duration_seconds{provider,phase}`. SuperGrok additionally exposes `opengeni_model_requests_inflight`, `opengeni_model_request_oldest_no_event_age_seconds`, `opengeni_model_request_stream_events_total`, and `opengeni_model_request_stream_event_gap_seconds`, all with provider-only labels. Provider ids come from the resolved provider registry; request ids, model bodies, credentials, session ids, and token content are not metric labels.

To locate one worker execution, derive
`turnExecutionTelemetryKey(workspaceId, sessionId, attemptId)` from
`@opengeni/observability` using authorized session and attempt records. The
domain-separated opaque key appears as `correlationId` on the
`worker.run_agent_segment` root and its `worker execution started` log; the log
also carries `traceId` and `spanId`. Query the trace store by that correlation
attribute, or follow the log's trace ID. Each recovered execution attempt has
its own key. Raw IDs are not exported, and this key is never a metric label.
The start log records an execution invocation, not a successful turn claim.
The existing completed `worker.prepare.claim_and_policy` span also carries the
validated opaque key. Once exported, it makes an active execution searchable
without waiting for its root to end. Claims that have not completed and export
latency remain explicit limits; this does not enable ordinary stdout retention.
Missing traces may reflect sampling or retention; the durable session timeline
remains authoritative. This linkage does not retroactively identify old traces.

Codex EOF classification waits for the SSE parser's final buffered block, including
a valid terminal without a trailing blank separator. Raw transport EOF is not
itself a failed response. Missing or failed semantic terminals remain failures;
the per-attempt audit fence still permits exactly one terminal outcome.

Native diagnostic observers run before the existing awaited
`agent.model.request` durable audit callback and cannot block or change it.
Durable append/publish fencing and ordering therefore remain the source of audit
truth. Every provider path first awaits a mandatory reconciliation of the SDK's
complete prior history at the follow-up request boundary. A provider can
therefore consume a completed tool batch only after its call/result pair is
replay-safe; the first request has no prior model/tool history to append.
When a Responses terminal omits its output array, completed stream items are
reassembled by numeric `output_index`; sparse provider positions are compacted
to the observed items rather than treated as missing output, while duplicate
indices still fail closed.
For generic providers, an attempt-local async context then awaits the durable
`started` checkpoint at the literal pre-fetch boundary; request bytes cannot
reach the wire first. Model-preparation `started` is durable before
`runStream` is invoked, including an immediately-calling native transport. A
semantic terminal is latched before downstream stream cleanup; if the consumer
cancels after parsing it, the audit remains `completed` rather than producing a
misleading trailing `failed`. Actual provider failure/incomplete/error,
transport failure, timeout, or caller abort remains failed/timed out. SuperGrok
persists only `started`, `headers`, `first_event`, and terminal checkpoints—not
every streamed event—and the terminal checkpoint carries bounded event-count,
last-event-type, last-progress-duration, and silence facts. An HTTP 200 SSE
error/failed/incomplete terminal is not forwarded into the Agents SDK; the
transport throws the bounded exact provider message. Rate-limit/capacity
refusals are marked 429 and enter the durable same-turn waiter; other
terminals persist that diagnostic on `turn.failed`. Lifecycle audit stays
metadata-only; worker stdout stays sanitized.

An already-paused session can receive Pause with a new idempotency key to re-arm
its own settled interruption's missing quiescence wake. This preserves control
revision and paused admission; the existing worker still proves exact activity
settlement and writer quiescence. Replaying the same key adds no wake revision.

## Debug context capture

The session Context inspector reads the latest attempt-fenced capture. The runtime
observes the final HTTP body inside `instrumentedModelFetch`, after Responses/chat
conversion and Codex, SuperGrok or gateway normalization. It stores the original
JSON string, including instructions, tools, input and settings; it never rebuilds
conversation content from events or current configuration. Dispatch proves an
outbound body, not provider acceptance or expansion of server-side state.

Streaming bodies are teed only when capture is enabled, capped at 4 MiB, and
cancelled with a failed/aborted transport. Inspection and persistence do not block
inference. Oversized/unsupported bodies produce an explicit unavailable receipt;
historical SDK-prefix captures and non-HTTP transports are labeled incomplete.
Capture ordinals are reserved before reading, so a slower older upload cannot
replace a newer request. The existing 16 MiB snapshot storage limit still applies.

Section and item token counts are character-based estimates, not provider usage.
Instructions display as the captured string without reconstructed sub-sections. Media, encrypted state and provider overhead have no exact local count.
The UI never substitutes the latest session usage event for usage of this exact
capture. Headers (including provider credentials) are outside the body capture.

The context browser shows 30 item previews per page and searches the full readable
captured content. Detail views read continuously, virtualize large text internally, support full-text
Find, and preserve full content for copying. New captures wait for an
explicit Load latest action while a user inspects an existing request. This is the
last captured model request, not an archive of the entire session.

### Operational notice and attachment replay stability

Runtime internal context is labeled as an OpenGeni turn-scoped operational notice.
History reconciliation persists these notices at their original positions,
including when replayed for remote compaction. Their status is historical on
later turns; current authorization and tool availability remain independently
enforced. Other unscoped synthetic system messages remain excluded.

Attachment receipt text derives only from the durable file reference and mount
directory. Resolving, losing, or renaming live file metadata does not rewrite
that text. Active image bytes still require current authorized metadata and
checksum-valid content; compacted attachment catalogs remain receipt-only.
The receipt-format change incurs a one-time prefix change for existing histories.

Service turns without a human file subject read shared attachments under an explicit
null subject, clearing inherited private-file authority for that lookup. The reader
restores the caller’s scope afterward; private and Drive-protected files still
require their independent authority.


Accepted private session uploads additionally use session-specific read grants,
including for service continuations. Realtime and ordinary human admission share
that transaction boundary. Original owner and provider ACLs remain separate;
see [Session attachments](session-attachments.md).
