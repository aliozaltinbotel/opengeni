  // Shared consent, connector, and response-deduplication code remains in the
  // application shell while provider SDKs stay lazy. The Workspace hub densifies
  // rail + settings against the session graph; a dedicated Radix vendor chunk
  // keeps Popper scopes intact (otherwise /settings crashes). The shared
  // composer also carries the tiny app-action slot used by realtime voice.
  // Existing-session scheduling, authenticated retained screenshots, and the
  // synchronous session projection grow the initial graph. The managed-app
  // catalog now includes governed Slack publication, read-only Atlassian, and
  // typed capabilities plus Browser/Computer resource contracts. The direct
  // session graph includes the small shared interaction-invalidation chunk;
  // live media renderers and browser/computer controls remain lazy. Workspace
  // channels and the "For you" rail entry add always-loaded rail code and one
  // more shared-chunk boundary in both graphs. Revision-fenced Connected Machine
  // command policy adds its memory/CPU fields to the shared session contract;
  // governed goal revision paging, rejection, and rollback add the matching SDK
  // methods to that same direct-session graph. Browser acceptance builds also
  // embed a configured VITE_API_BASE_URL; the supported loopback form adds up
  // to 18 raw bytes relative to the same-origin build. Keep a narrow full-KiB
  // envelope above that configured graph instead of a platform/config-specific
  // one-byte margin. The pre-migration Bun 1.3.14 Linux/x64 baseline measured the combined
  // Company Brain base at 2,039,311/2,039,328/2,039,329 raw bytes for
  // default/4-digit/5-digit API URLs; that integration already exceeded the old
  // cap. The lazy residual inspector adds 769 raw bytes in every case. The
  // reconciled 0262 stack adds another 270 bytes. The current-main organization
  // membership and connection-authority integration brings the combined default/4-digit/5-digit
  // graph to a worst observed 2,042,520 raw bytes. Truthful zero-step lifecycle
  // copy, the shared large-history disclosure scheduler, and durable sandbox-file
  // receipt/download controls bring the configured graph to 2,052,836 raw bytes
  // and 571,587 gzip bytes on both macOS/arm64 and Linux/x64. The always-loaded
  // tenant-transition boundary, invocation fences, selected context semantics,
  // the always-loaded managed self-context projection, and the organization
  // section router bring the combined direct-session graph to 2,060,739 raw
  // bytes locally. The configured Linux CI graph for the landed Personal
  // projection measured 572,514 gzip bytes. The workspace scope/deep-link
  // shell plus the landed catalog presentation measure 2,061,506 raw bytes on
  // macOS/arm64. The public session-tenancy SDK activation brings the merged
  // direct-session graph to 2,063,047 raw bytes on macOS/arm64. PR #1676's
  // Linux/x64 production build measured the direct-session graph at 2,064,626
  // raw and 573,599 gzip bytes. PR #1678's exact Linux/x64 production build

  // Surfacing goal pause/hold/backoff reasons in the session chrome and the

  // Managed organization bootstrap adds the authenticated principal routing

  // The document-authority reclassification work adds
  // `reclassifyDocumentAuthority`,

  // the app imports wholesale, so they are retained and the direct-session graph
  // grows. That is dead weight shipped to every browser session, and it is
  // structural rather than specific to this change: every future SDK method
  // taxes the browser bundle whether or not the browser uses it.
  //
  // Two independent growths stack in this head - that SDK surface and the
  // Connected Machine attachment graph above - so the measurement is taken on
  // the merged tree rather than on either change alone: 2,171,431 raw. The
  // 2121-KiB cap left only 473 bytes, short of the one KiB of headroom the rule
  // above mandates, so this advances to 2122 KiB. Every other cap stays fixed.
  // It remains a stopgap; the real fix is to make the client

  // Source-aware channel reconciliation adds the browser-only projection

  // and the 1.5-KiB gzip platform-skew allowance. Every file-count, initial,
  // per-file, lazy-chunk, and CSS cap stays fixed.
  // The organization-admin document migration audit adds three typed SDK

  // measures the direct-session graph at 2,175,302 raw / 607,439 gzip bytes.
  // Causal channel authority for independently polled root, pins-only, detail,
  // and post-move reads measures 2,175,936 raw / 607,961 gzip bytes in the exact
  // Linux/x64 production build. The current-main compatibility merge stacks
  // both surfaces at 2,179,430 raw / 608,650 gzip bytes. Advance only these two
  // aggregates to 2,130 KiB raw and 596 KiB gzip so the guard retains one KiB
  // of raw headroom and the 1.5-KiB gzip platform-skew allowance; every other
  // cap remains fixed. The separately tracked structural fix is to remove this
  // browser tax, not keep growing the shared client class.
  // Durable move settlement, start-ordered mutation evidence, compaction-safe
  // accepted-read fences, reactive rail projection, and queued-successor read
  // sharing measure 2,181,466 raw bytes against the reviewed head's 2,180,493.

  // The final one-time setup path keeps multiple pending invitations explicit,
  // removes implicit shared-workspace creation, and scrubs setup authority from
  // browser URLs. Main measured that graph at 2,180,307 raw / 608,688 gzip

  // of headroom, above the 1.5-KiB platform-skew allowance. Every file-count,
  // initial, per-file, lazy-chunk, and CSS cap remains fixed.
  // Timeline paging and settled-history hardening add compact cursor ownership,
  // retained-group memoization, split entrance gates, and lazy tooltip token
  // publication. After removing redundant wrapper/comparator bytes, the exact

  // The optional-operator-surface split moves six Document authority and tenancy-backfill

  // Permission-scoped work discovery keeps its advisory UI on the lazy Agents

  // Exact-ID Variable Set attachment resolution keeps attach/use-only grants
