/**
 * Wire grammar of the content-free web client error beacon

 *
 * A report is only a closed error kind, the matched route PATTERN (never a
 * concrete URL), and the bundle revision. The web client that projects a
 * report, the API route that admits it, and the public structured-log
 * projection that prints it all validate against these exact values, so the
 * browser can only send what the API accepts and logs.
 *
 * The same route also admits the closed operational signals below (requests
 * that never reached the server, live-stream health, and web vitals). They
 * follow the same rules: closed values only, a route pattern or page label,
 * never a URL, message, identifier, or user content.
