# Opengeni observability stack

`deploy/observability` is the optional Kubernetes observability distribution for
Opengeni. It is a thin Helm wrapper around the upstream
`kube-prometheus-stack` chart and packages the canonical Opengeni dashboards
from [`dashboards/`](dashboards/) without copying their JSON.

The wrapper is intentionally separate from `deploy/helm/opengeni`:

- this chart lifecycle-manages Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager,
  Grafana, kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and the canonical dashboard
  ConfigMaps;
- the Opengeni application chart owns `/metrics`, `ServiceMonitor`,
  `PrometheusRule`, and optional OTLP collector integration;
- environment overlays own ingress/TLS, Grafana administrator credentials,
  Alertmanager receivers, remote write, scheduling, and environment-only rules
  or dashboards.

The Runtime Failures dashboard separates workflow wake transport acceptance
from durable admission outcomes. Its admission-blocker panel explains whether
queued prompts, Steer, machine input, input-wait settlement, or prior-attempt
quiescence remain pending. These metrics count dispatch observations, including
retries of the same revision, rather than unique sessions or running turns.
The structured logs retain the same bounded `outcome`, `reason`, and `attempts`
fields; per-session state remains available through the authenticated session
API. Metrics do not contain session identities or raw error text.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.25 or newer (the pinned upstream chart requirement)
- Helm 3
- a default `StorageClass`, or an overlay that sets one explicitly
- enough capacity for the selected profile
- no second Prometheus Operator managing the same cluster-scoped resources
- for `--opensandbox`, the pinned OpenSandbox CRDs and
  `opensandbox-controller-metrics` Service installed before the wrapper

The dependency is exactly pinned in `Chart.yaml` and `Chart.lock`. Use
`helm dependency build deploy/observability`; do not replace the pin with a
version range or an unconstrained dependency update in deployment automation.

## Capacity profiles

The default values are a persistent, single-replica profile suitable for a
compact self-hosted cluster:

| Component | Persistent capacity | Retention |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Prometheus | 8 GiB | 7 days, capped at 6 GB |
| Alertmanager | 2 GiB | 120 hours |
| Grafana | 2 GiB | persistent database and plugins |

The compact profile filters metrics at ingestion, retaining every signal used
by the pinned Kubernetes mixin and Opengeni dashboards/rules while excluding
unused modern Go runtime fanout and redundant zero-valued pod reasons. Validate
the live target mix with `bun run bench:observability-series -- --prometheus-url
<url> --check`; the guard requires at least a 4x instantaneous series reduction
and treats TSDB head series as diagnostic because they include stale data.

`values.production.example.yaml` raises Prometheus to a 100 GiB volume with a
30-day time limit and an 80 GB retention-size limit, Grafana to 5 GiB,
Alertmanager to 5 GiB, and requires an existing
`opengeni-grafana-admin` Secret. It is a capacity and credential example, not a
complete production overlay. Prometheus applies whichever retention limit is
reached first, so this example does not guarantee 30 days of local history.
Measure the installation's actual series volume and ingestion rate, then size
local storage or configure remote write before making a 30-day operational
commitment. Review storage classes, volume reclaim policy, backups, replicas,
resource limits, ingress, and alert routing for each cluster.

## Plan and install

Print the ordered self-hosted plan:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability -- --profile single-node
```

Print the larger-profile plan as JSON:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability -- \
  --profile production \
  --environment production \
  --json
```

Add `--opensandbox` when the cluster uses the optional OpenSandbox backend:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability -- --profile single-node --opensandbox
```

That flag adds `values.opensandbox.yaml`, enabling bounded `Pool`
custom-resource metrics and the pinned controller `ServiceMonitor`. Per-workload
BatchSandbox and Pod state is aggregated at source by the Opengeni control
worker into fixed-label gauges. The base profile leaves those integrations
disabled so a cluster without the optional CRDs remains unaffected.

The plan deliberately installs only the wrapper. It never upgrades or rolls
back Opengeni application workloads and never executes application hooks. After
the wrapper is ready, include `opengeni.values.example.yaml` in the next
ordinary Opengeni application release using that release's exact chart version
and complete authoritative values. The ordering matters: the application chart
omits `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` when the Prometheus Operator CRDs do
not exist.

A direct default-profile install is:

```bash
helm dependency build deploy/observability
kubectl create namespace observability --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl create namespace opengeni --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl label namespace observability opengeni.ai/monitoring=enabled --overwrite
kubectl label namespace opengeni opengeni.ai/monitoring=enabled --overwrite

helm upgrade --install opengeni-observability deploy/observability \
  --namespace observability \
  --set-string "opengeni.sourceRevision=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --set-string "kube-prometheus-stack.grafana.podAnnotations.opengeni\.ai/source-revision=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --set-string kube-prometheus-stack.prometheus.prometheusSpec.externalLabels.environment=self-hosted \
  --wait --timeout 20m
```

For an OpenSandbox cluster, add
`--values deploy/observability/values.opensandbox.yaml` after installing the
OpenSandbox chart and `deploy/stacks/opensandbox-controller-metrics-service.yaml`.

For a new or existing Opengeni installation, include
`deploy/observability/opengeni.values.example.yaml` in the ordinary application
chart install or release upgrade. Do not run a local application-chart upgrade
solely to toggle observability: a different checkout can roll workloads and run
database migration hooks.

## Verify

Run the live contract verifier from the same immutable source revision used by
the install:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability-verify -- \
  --namespace observability \
  --release opengeni-observability \
  --app-namespace opengeni
```

It verifies:

- the expected wrapper chart release is deployed;
- every dashboard ConfigMap exactly matches its canonical JSON and content hash;
- the source-revision annotations match the source checkout;
- Opengeni `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` resources exist with the shared
  discovery label;
- the bundled Grafana, kube-state-metrics, and node-exporter ServiceMonitors
  carry the same discovery label and have healthy live targets;
- required rules are declared and loaded by the live Prometheus API;
- when the OpenSandbox overlay is enabled, controller reconcile/Kubernetes API
  metrics, bounded `Pool` state, and the control worker's fixed-label workload
  aggregates are present; raw BatchSandbox and workload-Pod exporter series are
  absent, so opaque sandbox, workspace, session, or attempt IDs cannot enter
  those metric labels;
- Grafana is healthy and its finite startup provisioner has copied the exact files.

`--skip-live-apis` is available only for object-level diagnostics; it is an
explicit verification gap, not proof that Prometheus or Grafana consumed the
objects.

When the wrapper dependency is disabled in favor of an existing Kubernetes
monitoring platform, point the same verifier at that platform while retaining
the canonical dashboard sidecar check:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability-verify -- \
  --namespace observability \
  --release opengeni-observability \
  --app-namespace opengeni \
  --prometheus-url http://127.0.0.1:19090 \
  --grafana-url http://127.0.0.1:13000 \
  --grafana-namespace monitoring \
  --grafana-pod-selector app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana \
  --grafana-sidecar-container grafana-sc-dashboard \
  --grafana-dashboard-directory /tmp/dashboards/Opengeni
```

The supplied HTTP endpoints must already be reachable through the operator's
trusted local tunnel or authenticated proxy. The verifier does not accept or
retrieve monitoring-platform credentials.

## Existing monitoring platforms

If a cluster already has a compatible Prometheus Operator and Grafana sidecar,
set `kube-prometheus-stack.enabled=false` and install this chart only for the
canonical dashboard ConfigMaps. The existing Prometheus instance must select
resources labeled `opengeni.ai/monitoring=enabled` in namespaces carrying the
same label, and the Grafana sidecar must select `grafana_dashboard=1` with the
`grafana_folder` folder annotation. Use the configurable verifier endpoints and
sidecar location above to produce the same complete receipt.

Do not install two Prometheus Operators into the same cluster without an
explicit CRD and ownership plan.

## Security and upgrades

- Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager are ClusterIP-only by default. Add
  authenticated ingress in an environment overlay; do not expose them
  anonymously.
- The bundled Grafana dashboard sidecar reads ConfigMaps only in its own
  namespace, runs once as an init container, and does not receive cluster-wide
  Secret access. The source-revision pod annotation restarts Grafana on each
  chart revision so dashboard and datasource updates are loaded without an
  always-resident Kubernetes watcher.
- Stable dashboard UIDs are intentional. UI edits to provisioned dashboards
  are not authoritative and may be overwritten by the next reconciliation.
- Treat a `kube-prometheus-stack` version change, regenerated `Chart.lock`,
  rendered manifest review, and live verification as one upgrade unit.
- Export Grafana state and confirm PVC/volume reclaim behavior before uninstall.
