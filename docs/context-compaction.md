# Conversation context compaction

OpenGeni freezes a per-session compaction mode at create time
(`sessions.codex_compaction_mode`):

| Mode | When | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `portable` | All non-Codex sessions; existing sessions (backfill); new Codex sessions when the workspace sets `codexCompactionDefault: "portable"` | Durable plaintext checkpoint (Codex CLI local path). Free mid-session provider switching. |
| `remote_v2` | New Codex sessions by default (`codexCompactionDefault` absent or `"remote_v2"`) | Codex remote compaction v2 (wire `compaction_trigger` → opaque `{ type: "compaction", encrypted_content }`). On a valid compaction item, install and recompute usage — same as Codex CLI (no local “must shrink / must differ” gate). The compact request **must** reuse the ordinary turn prompt-cache prefix: model-visible tool schemas + the exact agent `instructions` + active history + `compaction_trigger` (CLI `base_instructions` / `model_visible_specs` parity). Empty instructions are rejected. Operator `/compact` goes through normal sandbox and lazy-tool request preparation, stopping before ordinary inference. Retained cleartext keeps recent user/developer messages **including images** within the 64k budget. The Agents SDK rejects a bare trigger item, so OpenGeni emits `{ type: "unknown", providerData: { type: "compaction_trigger" } }` through `CompactionResponsesModel` and the Codex fetch normalizer restores the wire shape. Session is **Codex-only** for its lifetime (HTTP + worker admission). |

There is no off switch, compatibility ladder, ordinary-turn history trim, or
deterministic non-model fallback. A `remote_v2` session never silently falls
back to portable on remote failure (avoids mixed history shapes). Its single
overflow retry is described below. Azure / OpenAI platform remote compact APIs
are out of scope.

Workspace setting `codexCompactionDefault` only affects **new** Codex sessions;
later setting changes never move an already-frozen session.

The portable path follows Codex CLI 0.146.0 local compaction (upstream tag
`rust-v0.146.0`, commit `be449751a978f02e5bbba886999662956c7f38f5`) and is used
for OpenAI, Azure, registry providers, and portable-locked Codex sessions.

The implementation lives in:

- `packages/runtime/src/context-compaction.ts`: thresholds, portable rebuild,
  remote v2 retain/rebuild helpers, and the typed compaction signal.
- `packages/runtime/src/prepared-compaction-request.ts`: retains the actual prepared request prefix at the model dispatch boundary. Responses pre-turn/operator and mid-turn compaction stop there before ordinary inference; no prefix is rebuilt from the original Agent. A missing prepared request fails closed. Remote v2 preserves all prepared model settings; portable Responses preserves the prepared tools and instructions while applying its summary-specific output limit and provider safety settings.
- `apps/worker/src/activities/run-input.ts`: operator compaction loads canonical history through ordinary input preparation without a synthetic message or required update batch.
- `packages/runtime/src/index.ts`: portable summarizer + `requestRemoteCompactionV2`.
- `apps/worker/src/activities/context-compaction.ts`: mode branch, summarizer
  bounded remote overflow retry, remote fail-closed path, fenced durable replacement.
- `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/compaction-prep.ts`: pre-call and same-turn recovery;
  Codex ALS beta/turn-metadata headers for remote v2.
- `packages/db/src/index.ts`: the atomic history replacement and token signal.

## Token limits

Each resolved model can declare three distinct values:

| value | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| raw context window | basis for automatic compaction |
| effective input window | provider-safe input ceiling |
| automatic compaction limit | proactive checkpoint trigger |

If a model has no explicit automatic limit, OpenGeni uses
`floor(rawWindow * contextCompactionThresholdRatio)`. The ratio defaults to
0.9 and is clamped to 0.3–0.9. An explicit limit is capped at 90% of the raw
window, matching Codex core.

The Codex subscription catalog verified with Codex CLI 0.146.0 on 2026-07-29
has the following limits, and billed GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna pin the same
triple instead of the 1.05M deployment fallback:

| quantity | tokens |
| --- | ---: |
| raw context window | 272,000 |
| effective input window (95%) | 258,400 |
| automatic compaction limit (90%) | 244,800 |

Automatic compaction is provider-accounted. Before a provider response exists,
no local whole-request estimate may force compaction: OpenGeni sends the request,
then either records the provider's usage or handles the provider's typed context
overflow through the same compaction recovery. After a response, the per-call
guard anchors to that exact response's provider-reported **total** tokens and
adds only items appended after the last model-generated item plus positive
instruction or tool-schema growth. That anchor is accepted only when the usage
revision belongs to the immediately preceding model request; a delayed signal
is ignored rather than attached to newer input. Each in-activity stream retry
captures the activity-wide response count at entry. Reports at or before that
boundary are ineligible, and newer report revisions are translated to the new
stream's request numbering. Usage identities and deduplication remain
activity-wide and are never reset by compaction. At a later turn boundary, the
attempt-fenced provider-reported `last_input_tokens` is the only durable
automatic signal. Every newer authoritative terminal response replaces it with
that response's usable input count or null when the provider supplied none;
compaction and context clearing also set it to null. A missing or invalid count
never carries an older response's value forward. Local
estimates remain limited to shaping a compaction request and describing the
history-only before/after replacement; they never enter `last_input_tokens`.

Opaque Codex items (`type: "compaction"` with `encrypted_content`, and
reasoning with encrypted content) use Codex CLI's encrypted-payload heuristic
(`visible_bytes ≈ len * 3/4 - 650`, then `ceil(bytes / 4)` tokens). They are
never JSON-stringified into the local budget — that mistake treated ciphertext
as prompt text, inflated `last_input_tokens` after remote_v2, and re-triggered
auto-compaction.

Typed `input_image`, `image_url`, structured `image`, and
`computer_screenshot` objects are projected as native media before the generic
JSON/text estimate. Explicit detail and dimensions are retained; when needed,
a bounded byte prefix can recover PNG, GIF, WebP VP8X, or JPEG geometry. The
PNG path accepts geometry only from a complete first IHDR chunk with a valid
CRC32 over its type and 13-byte data. The dimension-aware estimate is capped, and unknown geometry uses one explicit
conservative bounded fallback. Inline image bytes or data-URL base64 therefore
do not grow the text estimate linearly. A data URL inside ordinary textual
content is still text and receives ordinary text accounting.

## Model-facing tool output

Every resolved model carries a textual tool-output policy. The Codex catalog's
10,000-token policy is the default; OpenGeni applies Codex's exact 1.2x JSON
serialization allowance, UTF-8-safe head/tail truncation, and explicit
`…N tokens truncated…` marker. Structured textual parts share one sequential
budget while images, files, and encrypted content remain structured.

The same pure normalizer runs at both canonical boundaries: before new
`session_history_items` rows are written and again at the final live model-input
seam. Raw pending tool-call receipts remain out-of-band until settlement so
Pause, Steer, failure, and deploy recovery can still reconcile the real outcome.
UI/audit events are a separate projection and are never used to reconstruct
model history.

The final request-time filter is not a compaction boundary. For an unchanged
canonical prefix and settings, a later provider request must reproduce the
earlier serialized filtered prefix exactly. Deterministic protocol
normalization and output bounding are allowed; arbitrary text must not be
classified or rewritten, and deleting or reordering an earlier
`view_image` call/result pair is not. Only the fenced durable replacement below
may remove active history.

## What the summarizer sees

The compaction model receives:

1. a bounded, protocol-valid temporary copy of the current active model history.
   Portable compaction omits opaque `encrypted_content` from that copy
   (plaintext reasoning stays; `{ type: "compaction" }` blobs are dropped)
   so a SuperGrok-origin session can compact on Codex. Durable rows stay.
   Remote v2 still sends Codex blobs. Portable preparation keeps the full
   sanitized history on its first request when it fits the structural window;
   an actual overflow permits one smaller retry.
2. one final user message containing Codex's checkpoint prompt;
3. for Responses providers, the exact prepared system instructions and
   model-visible tool schemas from the ordinary agent request; portable
   compaction sets `tool_choice:none` and cannot execute returned tool calls.
   Chat providers still use a tool-less transcript request and composed
   instructions because their protocol differs;
4. no provider-side context-management policy.

Portable checkpoint output is capped at 20,000 tokens or one quarter of the
model's configured context window, whichever is smaller. The input fitting
budget reserves that same amount, and the retained real-user-message budget
has the same cap. A Chat completion whose finish reason is
not `stop` cannot replace active history, even if it contains partial text.
Provider-specific output ceilings are not in the model catalog; a provider
that rejects this cap fails compaction with the existing active history intact.

Explicit compaction is a new accepted logical turn and therefore composes the
same deterministic workspace instruction-policy and preference-descriptor
governance as an ordinary agent turn. Its service initiator may inherit the
causal human's immutable preference authority from the latest started turn;
pure service compaction has no personal preference authority. The exact
snapshot is attempt-fenced, recovery reuses it, and Documents/RAG evidence are
never promoted into governance.

Responses providers use the Agents SDK's structured Responses conversion, so
tool calls/results remain real protocol items on the wire. Chat providers use a
request-local transcript adapter because Chat Completions has a different item
protocol. It projects only record types the Chat converter cannot express,
preserves their readable historical facts, and never mutates canonical history.
The Chat transcript is text-only: historical image pixels are unavailable to
that summarizer. Recent user images and references to omitted attachments are
retained by the replacement-history policy, but their visual meaning is not
inferred during the checkpoint.
Historical `tool_search` calls and outputs are not rerun, compared with the
current catalog, or reclassified. There is no switch-time rewrite and no second
durable history form.

Before the provider call, OpenGeni estimates the history and checkpoint prompt. It
replaces aggregate oversized tool results oldest-first only in the temporary
copy, preserving recent detail. If that remains too large, it removes whole
oldest user-delimited work units and re-sanitizes the suffix so no tool result,
call, or reasoning fragment is orphaned. The temporary history copy is kept
beneath the effective input ceiling and raw window minus requested summary.
For a prepared Responses call, OpenGeni reserves the estimated instruction and
tool-schema tokens before fitting history. If the provider still reports context
overflow, it refits history to 40% of the remaining target and sends one final
request. The provider may still count differently; on another overflow, active
history stays intact. If only the checkpoint instruction fits, OpenGeni stops
without asking the model to summarize unseen history. It never issues one
failing call per history item.

Remote v2 keeps its normal first request unchanged. Only an exact provider
`context_length_exceeded` code permits one retry to the same remote-compaction
endpoint. That retry uses a temporary copy in which strictly smaller,
protocol-valid placeholders replace tool-result bodies. Messages, reasoning,
tool calls, call/result identities and statuses, compaction checkpoints, and
item ordering are unchanged; no history unit is dropped. If there is nothing
to shrink, or if the retry fails, compaction stops. It does not fold chunks,
retry repeatedly, or cross over to portable compaction.

These reductions belong only to the explicit compaction transition and their
rewrite/drop counts are recorded on `session.context.compacted`. The unmodified
active history remains the source for the durable replacement and stays
byte-for-byte active if either provider request fails. For Codex subscriptions,
terminal SSE `response.failed` and `response.error` events that arrive on HTTP
200 become one non-retried, marked provider error with a bounded projection of
type/code/message/parameter and response identity; arbitrary nested diagnostics
are omitted and truncation is explicit. They are never misclassified as an
empty summary. A genuinely successful but empty response is a distinct typed
compaction failure with bounded, content-free response diagnostics. OpenGeni
never installs a manufactured placeholder as conversation truth.

## Durable replacement

The replacement history is:

1. the newest real user messages that fit one cumulative budget of at most
   20,000 tokens (one quarter of the context window on smaller models),
   in chronological order;
2. one user-role summary item prefixed with Codex's `summary_prefix.md` text and
   marked `opengeni_context_summary: true`.

Prior summaries are not kept as user boundaries. Both modes preserve images
in retained messages. Retention budgets charge projected image tokens as well
as text; a message whose non-text content cannot fit is omitted as a whole.
Existing text truncation preserves the retained image parts. Uploaded images
are reconstructed before summarization just as for ordinary inference; only
the compacted archive-reference catalog remains receipt-only. Durable machine inputs participate in the
history being summarized like every other canonical model item. Assistant
messages, reasoning, tool calls, and tool results leave the active model
history but remain in inactive audit rows.

On the **portable** path, the generated replacement must estimate strictly
smaller than the active input, and its deterministic fingerprint must differ
from the latest durable replacement (an exact repeat settles as
`replacement_unchanged`). **remote_v2** follows Codex CLI: a valid opaque
compaction item is installed without those local gates; token usage is
recomputed from the opaque-aware estimate afterward.

One transaction locks workspace, session, and turn; verifies
`turnId + executionGeneration + attemptId`; supersedes every old active row;
inserts the replacement at fresh whole-number positions; clears
`last_input_tokens`; records `session.context.compacted`; and clears a manual
compaction request when applicable. A stale attempt can do none of those writes.

## Timeline UX

Compaction is maintenance of **conversation history** supplied to the model, not a
rewrite of the chat transcript. The React timeline projects a first-class
`context-compaction` landmark (not a foldable notice):

| Event | Landmark phase |
| --- | --- |
| `session.context.compaction.requested` (idle manual claim) | `started` until a later finish settles it |
| `session.context.compaction.started` (attempt-fenced, before provider call) | `started` — live-published so the UI can show progress |
| `session.context.compacted` | `compacted` with optional `~before → ~after estimated history tokens` |
| `session.context.compaction.skipped` | `skipped` with a short reason |

Start and finish for the same turn settle in place (one landmark). The landmark
is a turn boundary, so mid-turn auto-compact stays visible between collapsed
pre/post activity instead of vanishing inside a chevron. Copy always reminds
that chat history above is unchanged. Provider `implementation` stays in the
event payload for debug, not as hero UI text.

## Observability

The turn worker records `opengeni_context_compaction_starts_total{trigger}`
immediately after the attempt-fenced `session.context.compaction.started`
transition commits, before best-effort live fanout or any provider call. A
successful replacement records `opengeni_context_compactions_total{trigger}`.
Both counters publish the closed trigger set (`auto`, `operator`, `proactive`,
`overflow`) at zero during turn-worker metric initialization.

The same durable event transaction updates a content-free exact-attempt pending
projection. Terminal `compacted`/`skipped` landmarks, attempt closure, and active
attempt replacement clear it. A control-worker monitor exports
`opengeni_context_compaction_pending`,
`opengeni_context_compaction_oldest_pending_age_seconds`, and a same-target
freshness gauge. The Helm `OpenGeniCompactionNotFiring` rule alerts when the
oldest pending automatic start exceeds 15 minutes. This remains correct across
concurrent turn activities, terminal skips, and turn-worker restarts while
following the resolved model's real compaction threshold instead of a static
token guess. No tenant or attempt identity becomes a Prometheus label.

## Turn behavior

Before a fresh user or goal inference, the worker checks the durable token
signal and any manual compaction request. During an inference, the per-model-call
filter raises `CompactionNeededError` when the threshold is reached. A provider
context-window rejection enters the same path.

The successful summarizer response reports usage through the same durable,
idempotency-keyed `agent.model.usage` and billing-ledger path as an ordinary
model call, owned by the current execution attempt. Codex subscription
allowance headers use the same per-account request context and remain separate
from OpenGeni token billing.

Both paths compact inside the same activity, turn, attempt, and sandbox.
Compaction never creates a prompt-queue row, a recovery message, a new logical
turn, or another sandbox. Normally the model then sees the durable replacement
history and continues the work. If human/API or Agent Steer arrives after
`session.context.compaction.started`, admission is immediate but interruption
is deferred so it cannot fence the checkpoint transaction. As soon as the
terminal `session.context.compacted` or `session.context.compaction.skipped`
landmark is durable, the ordinary turn settles `superseded` before another
model request and the Steer runs next. Pause and Cancel are not deferred.

If summarization produces an authoritative terminal failure, the turn ends
with an honest `context_compaction_failed` result. OpenGeni does not continue
with silently trimmed input and does not install a mechanical fallback summary.
Retryable provider failures instead recover the same accepted turn through the
ordinary provider/capacity path; they do not create another goal continuation,
and an explicit `/compact` request remains pending for that same-turn retry.
When a terminal failure belongs to an explicit `/compact`, one attempt-fenced
database settlement records
`session.context.compaction.skipped(reason="summarization_failed")`, clears that
one request, records `turn.failed`, and returns the session to idle. For a
failure during same-turn recovery, the exact turn is settled once. Machine
inputs already visible to the model remain delivered in active history and are
never requeued; only genuinely new updates remain pending. A worker crash
therefore cannot clear the request without matching terminal truth, and an idle
maintenance execution cannot immediately recreate itself forever. With no
newer actionable work wake, the workflow ends instead of retrying against
unchanged history. A later human/API prompt, Steer, explicitly requested
Compact, or genuinely new machine input can create newer truth and make one new
attempt. The active history stays unchanged throughout.

Codex-subscription responses are streaming on the wire even for this
non-streaming summarizer. Terminal `response.failed`, `response.error`, `error`,
and `response.incomplete` events are converted to ordinary non-2xx provider
errors before the SDK sees them; a stream with no terminal event is a protocol
error. None of these shapes may collapse to `{}` or be mislabeled as a
semantically empty assistant response. Persisted diagnostics contain only
bounded status/code/request identifiers, never the provider message or model
input.

When the latest finished inference has `code="context_compaction_failed"`, an
active goal remains active and ordinary pending system/child/schedule updates
remain durable, but neither may start another inference against the unchanged
history. A queued human/API prompt or Agent Steer instruction remains runnable
and receives the pending updates at its normal boundary. Explicit `/compact`
also remains runnable; it does not consume those updates, but a successful
checkpoint supplies newer finished-turn truth so the existing pending batch can
run next. This gate neither creates queue work nor consumes a goal
continuation counter.

Manual `/compact` sets one durable idempotent request. During active inference,
the worker observes it at the next model boundary and retries sampling in the
same logical turn after replacement. While idle, the request creates one
born-running `source="compaction"` maintenance execution on the existing turn
ledger. That execution is not conversational work and is never a prompt-queue
row; it exists to own model allocation, attempt fencing, recovery, and
settlement. Portable `/compact` still skips prepareTools/sandbox. `remote_v2`
`/compact` prepares tools and builds the agent first so the compact request
reuses the ordinary tools→instructions cache prefix, then settles without
inference. A Steer accepted while that standalone maintenance attempt is live
does not interrupt it; maintenance records its terminal compaction result and
completes normally, then the already-admitted Steer is the next runnable work.

The exact attempt that successfully installs the replacement clears the request
in the same transaction. If there is no active history, the generated
checkpoint is not strictly smaller, or it exactly repeats the latest durable
replacement, the exact attempt instead records
`session.context.compaction.skipped` with that reason and clears the request in
one transaction without changing history. A failed, paused, recovered, or
superseded attempt cannot lose the request or publish a current compaction
result; only an authoritatively recorded terminal summarization failure consumes
the request as described above.

### Portable Responses identity regression

Portable Responses checkpoints detach optional provider response-item `id`
fields from messages, plaintext reasoning, function, shell, computer and patch
calls/results, client-executed tool search, and hosted web search. Opaque
reasoning is omitted during checkpoint preparation; retaining a dependent
item's stored response id can otherwise make the provider require that omitted
reasoning even with complete inline content. The request-local projection uses
the normal inference strip primitive only for those types. The SDK reserves
`providerData.id` on those shapes, so deleting it separately is unnecessary.
Call/result correlation, payload ids, plaintext reasoning content and ordering
remain intact. Tool search uses the SDK's correlation/execution readers for
both top-level and `providerData` fields; an explicit server execution is kept.

A universal strip is unsafe: Azure accepts inline web-search and plaintext
reasoning without ids but rejects id-less file-search input with a missing-id
validation error. Other hosted-tool ids and approval/program links remain
intact. Normal inference and remote-v2 compaction retain their existing policies.
Azure-profile checkpoints set `tool_choice: "none"`: empty tool schemas alone
do not prevent that provider from returning a historical tool call instead of
summary text. Other Responses transports keep their prior tool-choice behavior;
tool-only responses still fail the existing empty-summary guard.

The known missing-reasoning rejection is classified as
`missing_required_reasoning_item` without retaining the provider message or its
referenced item ids. Unknown provider messages remain excluded. Provider
failures, incomplete provider responses (even with text), and empty summaries
still fail closed without changing active history. A provider's completed status
does not prove that a summary preserves every fact; the synthetic continuation
check verifies representative facts and tool semantics, not exhaustive semantic
equivalence. Original history remains archived by the existing checkpoint flow.

Run `bun test packages/runtime/test/portable-compaction-identity.test.ts` for SDK
wire coverage and `bun test scripts/operator/verify-portable-compaction.test.ts`
for the operator/disposable PostgreSQL regression. The test omits its database
case when PostgreSQL is unavailable locally; `OPENGENI_REQUIRE_REAL_DB=1` makes
that absence fail in CI. The explicit `--live --durable` canary always requires
PostgreSQL. Each caller owns and releases its disposable database, including
when checkpoint verification or client cleanup fails. The operator project is
part of CI typechecking; its source fixtures are formatted TypeScript rather
than byte-exact fixture exemptions. Database settlement/fencing also remains
covered by `apps/worker/test/context-compaction-activity.test.ts`.

For live verification, configure Azure's base URL or endpoint/deployment and
API key or AD token, then run `bun run verify:portable-compaction --live --durable`.
All provider legs use the runtime's Azure client, including its authentication
and API-version query handling. The kickoff must contain opaque reasoning and
a dependent assistant message. Durable mode uses disposable PostgreSQL and the
real fenced compaction activity, verifies unchanged archival, the committed
checkpoint event and cleared token/request state, then supplies the reloaded
checkpoint to a correlated tool call/result continuation. That continuation must
recover an unpredictable receipt from an old tool result; the receipt is absent
from retained user messages, system instructions and the verification prompt.
The canary requires exactly one continuation call, preserves that request's
complete prefix when supplying its result, and disables further tool selection
for the final acknowledgement. It never reads or modifies a customer session.
Omit `--durable` for provider-only verification;
the receipt distinguishes the two modes. Locally authored assertion messages
are visible; arbitrary provider errors and SDK causes remain content-free.

### Cache-preserving compaction requests

Remote v2 compaction carries the ordinary agent’s effective reasoning effort and
summary setting, alongside its exact instructions and tool schemas. Omitting the
reasoning configuration can change provider-side instructions before the long
history is summarized. Durable turn-scoped operational notices remain at their
original positions in the compaction input. The resulting summarized history is
still a deliberate new prefix.

### Reasoning effort updates (opt-in)

`OPENGENI_REASONING_CONFIGURATION_UPDATES_ENABLED` defaults to false pending
live Codex backend verification. For GPT-6 Astra on the built-in OpenAI/Codex
Responses routes, accepted effort changes become durable `configuration_update`
items before the accepted turn input. The first enabled turn establishes the
request-level baseline; later changes keep that baseline. Existing sessions may
incur one baseline transition when enabled. Unsupported models, providers and
reasoning efforts retain the existing request-level behavior.

The exact attempt fence protects insertion and retries do not duplicate updates.
Private baseline metadata stays in canonical history, outside SDK-visible items;
only protocol fields pass through the SDK unknown-item adapter. Updates are
removed from model input on unsupported routes. Adjacent updates are coalesced
in the provider projection because the API rejects consecutive updates.

Explicit compaction retains the actual summary landmark and stores a fresh
configuration item after it, carrying the selected effort and original baseline.
Portable replacement fingerprints include this trailing item. Do not combine
these updates with provider automatic compaction/truncation or `/responses/compact`.
Our remote-v2 path uses an explicit `compaction_trigger` on `/responses`.
The response's effort field reports the baseline, not the selected update;
accepted turn policy remains the source of the user's selected effort.
