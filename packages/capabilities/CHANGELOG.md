## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

## 1.1.0

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/network@1.1.0

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/network@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Reset package versioning: every published `@opengeni/*` package now releases together at one shared version, starting at 1.0.0. Install all `@opengeni` packages at the same version. Earlier versions are retired.

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- aa41b15: Omit Outlook meeting suggestions, which need shared-calendar permissions and do not support personal Microsoft accounts, from the default calendar operation set. Keep calendar, event, and availability operations under the existing OAuth permissions.
- Updated dependencies [3cc26b5]
  - @opengeni/network@0.3.2

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- c60d38a: Include normalized effective OpenAPI operation destinations and the primary manifest URL in immutable revision identity. URL rotation no longer reuses a document-only revision, while equivalent destinations still deduplicate and existing immutable versions and installation fences remain intact.

  Classify known credential Connection rejection at install-time revalidation separately from internal failures. Missing or inaccessible references return 404, and inactive or incompatible references return 422 without weakening ownership, scope, or optimistic-concurrency checks.

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 6a97313: Publish the curated Integration `autoApproval` governance field and the `autoApprovalForbidden` helper that `@opengeni/api-router` imports.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 084e56b: Apply the curated source size limit consistently when parsing Microsoft's Graph definition while preserving the smaller limit for custom sources. Keep OneDrive file and sharing operations within the tool limit by excluding the nested Excel workbook API.
- 37f16c2: Keep curated Microsoft Graph integrations within storage and MCP schema limits by explicitly exposing provider-validated JSON bodies instead of expanding the recursive entity graph. Preserve request parameters, body requirements, media types, authorization and write approvals. Reject oversized compiled revisions during preview before installation begins.

  Request People.Read for the signed-in user's people suggestions. Keep OneDrive to file scopes and omit the organization-only followed-sites surface, allowing personal Microsoft accounts to complete consent.

## 0.3.0

  and route Gmail's reviewed REST bridge through the generic adapter selection
  seam.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- a551666: Fix local Gmail provider OAuth callbacks, Google scope equivalence, stable
  Discovery compilation, and installed API integration visibility in session
  tool selection.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace provider presets and nullable integration identities with immutable Integration Definitions. Curated and workspace-authored integrations now share one definition-based contract, provenance model, OAuth callback, SDK route, runtime projection, and maintenance migration with no legacy API alias or fallback authority.
- 1e78f58: Make Facet definitions and bindings authoritative throughout the Integration domain. Public routes, SDK methods, Pack components, owner identities, physical tables, persisted manifests, and runtime projections now use one Facet vocabulary with a maintenance cutover and no compatibility aliases.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- d73a2a9: Ship the package-local Apache license and declare Capabilities route scroll ownership so verified releases pass their source and package contracts.
- 5c5ea4a: Add the universal capabilities platform with named API integration instances,
  provider-specific feature bindings, and local runtime adapters.
