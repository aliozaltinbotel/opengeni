# @opengeni/react

## 7.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a4a45c: Make long turns read like a coding agent in the compact progress presentation (`turnSummary={{ rolling: true }}`). Assistant commentary joins its activity cluster (a phase-less message of the running turn stays the live note until its turn ends or it outgrows a note), and each exchange folds behind one status row ("Working · 2m 14s · 12 steps" with the latest progress note and current step, or "Waiting for 2 agents · 3m") with the answer below a "Worked for …" separator. Routine machine inputs, recorded waits, and compaction fold inside the exchange; failures, approvals, auth recovery, human input, scheduled prompts, and images stay visible. Following the tip stops once an answer pushes its question to the top, and a "Your question" control returns to the question being read. Recorded waits now say "Waited for 1 agent · 3m 5s" instead of "Wait recorded".

  New API: `groupTimeline(items, { foldExchanges: true })`, `TurnSummary`'s `status` prop, optional `waitingAgents` / `waitEndedAt` on recorded wait notices, and optional `startedAt` (when a streamed message began) on `AgentMessageItem`. `ActivityItem` now includes `AgentMessageItem` for folded commentary; exhaustive switches over activity kinds need an `agent-message` case.

- a6644b6: Framework adapters for web-standard handlers such as
  `createSessionProxyHandler` and `createChatHandler`: `@opengeni/sdk/next`
  (`toNextRouteHandlers`, `createSessionProxyRoute` for an App Router catch-all
  route), `@opengeni/sdk/express` (`toNodeMiddleware` for Express, Connect, and
  `node:http`, streaming SSE and aborting on disconnect), and
  `@opengeni/sdk/hono` (`toHonoHandler`).

  The session proxy serves the chat list (`listSessionPage`, limited by default
  to the chats the resolved user created; `sessionList: "visible" | false`) and
  archive/restore (`archive: false` to disable). `@opengeni/react` adds
  `SessionList` and `OpenGeniChat`, a list-plus-conversation experience with a
  responsive sidebar/drawer, a new-chat composer, and rename/archive.

- a6644b6: `OpenGeniProvider` no longer blocks or reloads the page when the server's API
  contract revision differs from the bundle's; that stale-tab protection is now
  the opt-in `reloadOnApiContractChange` prop used by the stock OpenGeni console,
  so an OpenGeni deploy never reloads an embedding product's page. The session
  proxy reports its own SDK contract revision in `/v1/config/client` and never
  forwards the upstream `x-opengeni-api-contract` header to the browser.
- d480872: Agent links to OpenGeni objects now work inside an embedding product. `artifact:` files download by default from `SessionConversation`; sandbox-path downloads require explicit proxy `sandboxFiles: true` and use bounded, no-symlink reads within the session working directory. Editable artifacts and Sites route through a new `resolveLink` prop (`MessageTimeline`, `SessionConversation`, `Markdown`, `OpenGeniLinkProvider`) instead of rendering console paths that 404 on the host origin. Invalid reserved references render unavailable. `parseOpenGeniLink` in `@opengeni/sdk` classifies the same hrefs for non-React clients and preserves validated console return hints. Editable-artifact export uses configured exporter capabilities and preflights the exact format and options before creating a snapshot or pinning a version. Stock deployments serve spreadsheet XLSX; the artifact Skills stop promising unsupported PDF/DOCX/PPTX exports.
- a6644b6: `@opengeni/react` no longer names the optional `@pierre/diffs` peer in any
  `import()` reachable from the conversation, so a Next.js (Turbopack) or Vite
  host that imports only `OpenGeniProvider` and `SessionConversation` builds
  without it. Hosts that install `@pierre/diffs` opt in once with
  `enablePierreDiffs()` from the new `@opengeni/react/diffs` entry (or
  `registerPierreDiffs(loader)`); otherwise diffs and file views are plain text.
  `SessionConversation` hides its model picker when the client config reports
  `modelSelection: false`, with a `modelPicker` prop to override.

  `createSessionProxyHandler` adds `beforeForwardMessage`, which returns
  server-owned `modelContext` and MCP credential rotations
  (`mcpCredentialUpdates`) for every forwarded message, steer, composer submit,
  and browser-started create, or a `Response` to refuse it. With
  `modelSelection: false` the proxy reports it in the client config.
  `ClientConfig` gains the optional `modelSelection` field.

- a6644b6: `SessionConversation` now renders pending tool approvals with Approve/Reject
  actions, wires composer file attachments into sent messages when the
  deployment enables file uploads (opt out with `attachments={false}`), and
  accepts a `toolRegistry` for product-specific tool-call rendering.

### Patch Changes

- d00a203: Keep every answer visible in the compact progress presentation (`turnSummary={{ rolling: true }}`). An answer was folded into the "Worked for …" row, and shown only as a muted two-line preview, as soon as another machine-triggered turn followed it in the same exchange (an agent message, child result, wait timeout, goal continuation, background command result, or steer instruction). Now only work folds: the later turns fold into a new row below the answer, which opens as soon as the input is delivered, and their own answers render below that row. A reader stopped at an answer stays in place while that later work runs.
- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- 1503ad7: Report unavailable browser controls even while cached or live frames remain visible, and disable keyboard capture until control recovers.
- 4f6d83a: Keep browser diagnostics opaque and confined to the page viewport, below tabs,
  address controls, and human handoff banners. Correct missing browser and desktop
  surface/text color utilities in both themes, and keep drawer actions usable in
  narrow docks.
- 7a3d134: Keep browser profile and launch menus within narrow viewer panels, with scrollable
  content. Dismiss browser menus on outside pointer input or Escape without closing
  the expanded workspace underneath.
- 01f50bf: Mark the composer send and pause buttons and the queued-prompt Steer buttons
  with a stable `data-analytics-action` attribute (`send`, `pause`, `steer`) that
  a host's product analytics can read. The attribute is inert, and a host can
  override it on `SendButton` and `PauseButton` through their props.
- 0aa60a6: Keep a failed optional Files module inside its workspace tab with an explicit
  reload action instead of replacing the conversation and composer with a route error.
- 4b39032: Load the optional workspace Files renderer asynchronously when first mounted, keeping chat and workspace
  state mounted while its renderer loads. Preserve file capability checks and the
  existing visited-tab lifetime.
- 454476c: Fence retained history-navigation callbacks and pending page reads to their owning
  session, workspace, client, and replay lifetime. Stale navigation cannot stop a
  replacement session's live feed, replace its history, or leave loading stuck.
- 4b39032: Expose successful initial history readiness independently of loading and stream
  errors, including empty histories. Clear stale initial-load errors on fenced retry
  and successful window recovery without letting old sessions overwrite new state.
- 4b39032: Give queued Latest question callbacks a current-navigation guard so a delayed
  refresh cannot reopen the queue after another history jump. Reuse canonical
  execution evidence when locating queued prompts whose ledger lacks turn.started,
  including tools, startup, recovery, and capacity events.
- 4b39032: Load the optional Latest question resolver on demand while preserving queued
  destinations, bounded history, retryable lookup errors, and navigation guards
  across the module-loading delay.
- a6644b6: Diff and file views already on screen upgrade to highlighted rendering when a
  host registers `@pierre/diffs` later, so hosts can call `enablePierreDiffs()`
  from the lazily loaded route that renders diffs instead of at startup. The
  OpenGeni console now does this, keeping the peer and its highlighter out of
  the initial bundle.
- dcb578d: Keep legacy timeline work without turn IDs aligned with approval, terminal status, and subsequent-work boundaries instead of leaving stale Working indicators.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- cabfc5e: Adopt the neutral theme: a shared `hover` token, unified menu and popover
  styling across the composer, model picker, realtime control and file browser,
  refreshed terminal colors, and "Opengeni" in user-visible copy.
- a1b6b8e: An automatically attached (optional) repository that loses access after a task started no longer fails the task's later turns. Before the strict per-turn GitHub App allowlist recheck and installation-token mint, the worker drops, for that turn only, each optional repository the workspace allowlist no longer admits or the GitHub App installation can no longer reach, and reports it as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on a `sandbox.operation.completed` event named `optional-repository-access`. It only ever removes repositories; explicitly attached repositories keep the strict behavior.

  Optional repository clones are also bounded (60 seconds each, 90 seconds together) when the sandbox has a `timeout` binary, so a hung fetch is skipped with the usual warning instead of failing sandbox setup. Explicit clones are unchanged.

  `@opengeni/github` adds `findInaccessibleGitHubAppInstallationRepositories`. `@opengeni/runtime` exports `OPTIONAL_REPOSITORY_CLONE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and `repositoryCloneCommand` and `runRepositoryCloneHook` accept an optional per-repository timeout.

  `@opengeni/react` keeps the `optional-repository-access` report out of the transcript, like the routine repository-clone event.

- c2acd21: Show annotation-only queued turns in the compact session-chrome queue. A queued turn with an empty prompt and timeline annotations rendered as a blank row; it now shows a keyboard-reachable annotation-count chip ("Review 1 annotation") that opens the existing read-only review dialog, prompt-plus-annotation rows show both, and optimistic queue rows follow the same rule. The compact queue and `QueueSurface` share one presentation rule, and an item with neither a prompt nor annotations shows "Content unavailable" instead of blank space. `TimelineAnnotationsChip` accepts an optional `compact` prop for dense rows.
- 4b39032: Keep assistant progress and prior replies readable in independent turn summaries,
  with rolling tool activity and truthful Working/Worked timing. Remove cross-turn
  folding, text-length display inference, and forced answer anchoring. Add a single
  Latest question navigation callback backed by bounded durable history lookup.
  Keep expanded outer work headers reachable with section-scoped stickiness,
  without stacking nested headers or changing timeline scroll ownership.
  Resolve Latest question against authoritative queue/lifecycle state: focus pending
  prompts in SessionChrome, restore distant started prompts at their actual turn
  boundary, and skip withdrawn prompts without getting stuck on invisible rows.
- 4b39032: Keep standalone completed maintenance compaction visible without creating a live
  work summary. Clear resolved approval waiting from same-turn lifecycle/tool-result
  evidence while preserving historical attention landmarks and renewed approvals.
- 9649fcc: Share retained-image retry and figure markup to keep the session bundle within its existing size budget.
- a5da013: Allow retrying failed saved-image retrieval in the timeline without recapturing screenshots or modifying conversation history.
- 8a9d19e: Add human-authorized removal of saved personal/workspace Skills with version checks and replay after deletion. Allow installed capability shortcuts to display their status visibly.
- a12f4cf: Keep the model picker open after selecting a model so reasoning effort can be adjusted without reopening it.
- e403746: Keep live per-turn progress above one trailing activity disclosure, then fold settled progress and tools together chronologically while leaving the final response visible. Preserve expanded work, manual-reader position and focus, phase-aware duration, attention surfaces, and classic grouping.
- 4b39032: Keep Latest question and earlier-history controls in separate pointer regions
  when both are visible, including narrow mobile layouts. Preserve existing
  history navigation, callbacks, and scroll ownership.
- d480872: An expanded turn's sticky work header now pins flush to the top of the timeline instead of 3.5rem below it, so rows no longer scroll visibly above it; the floating Latest question action sits below the header strip.

  - @opengeni/sdk@7.4.0

## 7.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6cbccaa: Keep IME candidate-selection and commit keys local to the browser viewer so composing text cannot move the remote caret or submit a remote form. Continue forwarding committed text and subsequent ordinary keys.

## 7.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 78f1d59: Offer native dropdown choices in BrowserViewer when Chromium page frames omit the popup. Keep selection bound to the observed control and preserve normal input/change events, private-field redaction, and disabled options.
- 7f75daa: Keep long browser session lists scrollable with their action buttons visible, and label browser choices for assistive technology.
- 889a360: Accept fresh browser frames when an attachment renews and its producer restarts the frame sequence for the same page.
- ac83339: Show browser discovery failures and retry target loading instead of displaying a semantic-only browser when session loading fails.
- 1fa1216: Bind browser viewer input to the frame actually painted, cancel stale queued input
  across navigation and target changes, and preserve ordered scroll input. Treat
  plain upstream gateway failures as transport errors without blindly replaying
  browser mutations.
- 1842911: Recover managed browser viewers through the existing session when an unrelated attached Chrome profile loses its connection. Negotiate focused-input observations so native select choices appear after a viewer click, with existing generation fences and explicit fallback for older controllers.
- 6d4ccb9: Preserve keyboard focus after desktop canvas clicks, bind pointer input to the
  painted frame, and discard stale queued gestures and clipboard continuations.
  Keep continuous scrolling responsive while preserving ordered input and deltas.
- ec707de: Negotiate bounded viewer typing batches from the active browser controller. Preserve
  individual text events and input order while reducing request overhead; recheck the
  original document fence before each action and discard uncertain queued input
  without replay. Older controllers retain sequential input.
- 212de3d: Keep queued browser input fences without retaining earlier screenshot bytes or render callbacks. Preserve input order and discard queued actions when their viewer generation changes.
- cc4bc8e: Hide the agent workspace's machine-state chip while viewing independent Browser or Desktop resources. Those viewers retain their own runtime status, so a sleeping agent sandbox no longer makes an active browser appear asleep.

## 7.2.0

### Patch Changes

- 19ecc86: Composer `autoFocus` no longer moves focus out of an open menu, listbox, or dialog when the composer becomes interactive late, so a hydrating composer cannot dismiss a menu the person just opened.
- b85a966: Keep suspended browsers asleep when their viewer opens, and resume only after an explicit Open browser action.
- d0b6742: Detach live browser frames when the page has been hidden, and reconnect when it becomes visible.
- 2eaeec6: Publish the `@opengeni/react/accounts` subpath with its built JavaScript and declaration files. The previous release mapped that export to a source file name the package does not ship, so importing it failed.
- Updated dependencies [084616e]
- Updated dependencies [1a427e0]
- Updated dependencies [6eb431b]
  - @opengeni/sdk@7.2.0

## 7.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 24968dd: Keep retained image retrieval out of compact progress labels so they do not report a missing image loader while the full timeline image remains available.

## 7.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3d33f17]
  - @opengeni/sdk@7.1.1

## 7.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bf744ed: Add optional model-policy picker group labels, icons and description overrides for host branding, shared by menu, trigger, accessibility and search without changing model or billing behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 701ea95: Preserve the original shell command when adopting background processes, so running command rows and completion notices show the command instead of execCommand. Keep long command rows ellipsized and expose their saved preview on hover and expansion.
- e9c4379: Resolve published-file Markdown links through host navigation, expose message presentation in SessionConversation, and document exact retained-file link/embed syntax.
- d92af11: Keep original command text through ambiguous launch recovery and persist it separately from bounded previews. Preserve whitespace, mark clipped previews with an ellipsis, and show complete commands on expansion and hover.
- a463199: Increase browser conversation retention from 8 MiB / 10,000 events to 160 MiB / 200,000 events, reducing eviction during history navigation without changing fetch sizes or folding behavior. Account for appended event bytes incrementally instead of serializing retained history on every live batch.
- 2f8bc58: Use bounded readable MCP tool aliases while preserving exact account routing and historical approval rehydration. Retain action and account display metadata in native and Codemode timeline events and approval cards without changing execution or approval identity. Legacy opaque calls resolve only against the current authorized tool catalog.
- dd3387f: Preserve Markdown paragraphs and embedded media when host link callbacks change, preventing selection jumps and video preview restarts.
- a463199: Repair workspace control revisions behind their retained event frontier, preventing historical control replay on each fresh browser load. Reject subsequent revision rollback without altering pause state, timers, or historical events. Stop refreshing last-started model metadata for unrelated control changes.

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

### Minor Changes

- 3b73fc0: Add server-authoritative session-page sorting by last activity, creation date, or durable name and explicit active, archived, or all archive status. Pagination cursors bind these choices, and clients reject servers that do not acknowledge requested ordering or archive filtering.

  The stock sidebar offers compact Status, Group by, Sort by, and Show empty groups controls with workspace- and subject-scoped persisted preferences.

- 1c924ed: Add authorized, resumable literal search of saved user and completed assistant
  messages, including unloaded history. Workspace search can return one
  representative match per session; in-session Find returns every occurrence with
  stable event identity and original-text UTF-16 offsets. Requests and browser
  result batches remain bounded, with explicit continuation and provisional counts.

  Expose bounded exact-sequence history navigation and message highlighting for
  React hosts. The web console connects a contextual session-search dialog to
  full-history Find, preserves search state across navigation, and keeps ended
  conversations readable. Tool output, reasoning and unfinished delta-only
  assistant messages are outside the initial searchable scope. Exact Markdown
  matches use a labeled source excerpt that stays in place when Find closes;
  readers can explicitly restore the formatted message.

- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

### Patch Changes

- cf9249d: Keep document typing and paste after a trailing newline, ignore IME composition Enter, and show spreadsheet General numbers without binary residue while leaving stored values and formula-bar source unchanged.
- 4258aeb: Show browsable public Skill results before a search and align Skill and Plugin catalog grids across desktop and mobile.

  Give connection setup a clear primary authorization action and quieter recovery controls, with shared responsive styling.

  Reuse plugin and skill discovery results briefly across tab visits with client/workspace/query isolation, align installed shortcuts, and remove duplicate catalog headings and search affordances.

  Keep All available in Capabilities navigation and cap its ordered category previews at six results, with explicit navigation to the full filtered category.

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.
- d5dba2a: Respect composer delivery readiness even when attachments are ready. File-only messages remain supported when the delivery owner reports them ready to send.
- 667a90f: Keep available connection services usable when another catalogue fails or stalls, handle synchronous transport failures, and discard stale discovery results after scope changes.

  Keep the console's Gmail logo fallback independent of the complete service registry so it does not bundle unused provider icons.

- 47a37c8: Align the optional voice-model drill-in header and spacing with the composer's resource menus while preserving model availability and payment-source selection.
- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- aa09567: Preserve explicit host MCP delegation selections through durable composer Send and Steer admission, including exact retries after an uncertain response. Keep existing owner, generation, visibility, revocation and replay checks; omitted selections do not inherit authority.
- 9de8e51: Route missing integration setup through provider-neutral catalog discovery and the shared human authorization card, with an explicit next action for every eligible catalog integration. Continue account selection and installation through owner authorization without an extra launch click, and open repository configuration in a separate tab.
- f3920a7: Add a compact accessible mobile slide selector so presentation editors can jump to any slide when the desktop rail is hidden below `sm`, without changing desktop rail virtualization or keyboard selection.
- 132b945: Add organization-owned integration acquisition policy with a discoverable catalog,
  revisioned administration API and SDK, and organization settings. Enforce selected
  provider and custom-protocol permissions on supported setup and installation paths
  at preparation and persistence boundaries.

  Preserve ordinary ownership and authorization, exact completed-request replay,
  unchanged reconciliation, cancellation and other reducing operations. Existing
  connection execution and credential refresh are not revoked by this policy.
  Deployment-configured tools and embedding-host session-local MCP configuration
  retain their existing admission rules; this is not a network or execution allowlist.

  Apply the organization integration policy migration and matching role provisioning
  with the matching runtime before enabling the setting. Older runtimes do not enforce
  the new acquisition policy. See `docs/organization-integration-policy.md` for the
  administration, identity, persistence and recovery contract.

- 1cb688d: Add explicit permanent Skill removal review bindings and truthful removal receipts.
  Deletion approval is bound to the exact removal proposal; existing save approvals
  cannot authorize irreversible deletion. Review surfaces distinguish removal from
  activation and preserve conversations.
- 621201d: Distinguish queued sessions from running agents and expose durable dispatch wait
  evidence in session detail reads, including retry timing and recorded errors.
- f7e41e7: Show unavailable saved changes previews inside the affected Changes view instead of displaying capture-error notifications when a session opens. Preserve the existing explicit live-workspace action and the live-only Staged view.
- 9d9b94b: Allow plugin discovery to choose an initial registry while preserving all registry filters. The OpenGeni web catalog initially selects OpenAI.
- 6b32304: Reuse the shared activity row and running-command animation for incomplete previews, replacing the standalone loading card while preserving completion and interruption behavior.
- c9e2743: Accept an explicit null skill-review reference on structured human-input questions, matching the contracts wire type without changing API runtime validation.
- 0bf014d: Add a session-authorized Codex account projection. Capacity retry choices follow
  the waiting turn's accepted subscription pool after source changes, including
  Disabled. Running turns keep their accepted account label while next-turn
  choices and workspace settings continue to use the current source.
- c4a2775: Unify provider and MCP service discovery in the embedded connection panel. Preserve Gmail branding for personal accounts without workspace installation references, bundle Outlook branding, share service logo loading, and clarify ownership and tool-selection copy.
- b88890f: Show a neutral pulsing dot and command count on the session activity button, with reduced-motion support. Open command details directly when background commands are present.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 85cafd0: Add a shared workspace/session artifact catalog over existing Sites, editable artifacts, generated images, and published files. Keep file bytes and content authorization in their existing domains, expose bounded filtered discovery through the SDK, and retain explicit sandbox-file publication provenance. The web Artifacts library includes type/search/sort controls, grid/list views, retained image previews, and file viewers that do not wake compute. Published images use the shared chat image/lightbox presentation; ordinary HTML file downloads remain non-executable.

### Patch Changes

- 71ca29b: Preserve the current history window when loading later activity fails, expose the original error, and offer explicit timeline retry without repeated observer requests. Ignore late failures from a previous session or navigation lifetime.
- Updated dependencies [85cafd0]
  - @opengeni/sdk@6.1.0

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Minor Changes

- 750060c: Support inline HTML visualizations, retained images, and embedded Sites in chat. Add a plain HTML Site client, preserve application request headers through the shared bridge, document visualization workflows, and use Image 2.5 Sunburst for Codex image generation.
- 46a0267: Load authoritative goals on mount when reusing a shared event feed. Add optional native loading messages for accessible status, slow waits, and details controls, preserving English defaults. Expose SessionChrome's successful queue-checkout composer focus handoff.

### Patch Changes

- 48c624f: Show discovered desktop targets immediately so slow or failed semantic inspection cannot block the live view or switching windows and screens.
- d5582c1: Accept restarted frame sequences after a fresh desktop attachment so automatic renewal does not freeze the last image. Preserve frame ordering within a stream and reject detached sockets.
- 49d43e6: Show desktop connection errors and Reconnect after an established stream fails or socket retries are exhausted, and let Refresh desktops retry a failed stream.

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c1ad490: Allow hosts to localize user-message disclosure actions through direct component props and the default timeline composition. Each label falls back independently to English, while message expansion, accessible controls, and scroll anchoring retain their existing behavior.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0507f91: Retry timed-out composer draft reads with backoff and clear their warning after a successful refresh, including when the draft revision is unchanged. Keep draft-read failures separate from Send, Steer, and control failures, and identify draft sync timeouts in the composer message.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d40bd9b: Replace startup timing rows with a quiet animated genie and rotating loading copy. Retain timing evidence in diagnostics, support a browser-local detail preference, and keep failures visible. Add a replayable loading studio.

### Patch Changes

- 4e2b59d: Keep loading animation options self-contained in public declarations so NodeNext consumers do not need to resolve the renderer's internal type imports. Supported animation options and runtime behavior are unchanged.
- 4e2b59d: Route plugin discovery types and endpoint compatibility through the public SDK boundary, using a narrow contracts entry without schema-runtime imports.
- 9968ae5: Allow host rendering of DeviceAuthorization while retaining shared clipboard state and URL validation. Restore the native Codex and SuperGrok subscription sign-in panels without changing embedded defaults or integration setup.
- 488a69b: Expose bounded current-failure evidence on session detail reads so recovery diagnostics do not depend on timeline pagination. Show recorded consecutive retry streaks without inventing lifetime totals, and distinguish Codex account assignment, affinity/lease reuse, and actual switches without changing allocation policy.

  Read session status and its replay cursor coherently, decode bounded diagnostics through the lossless storage codec, and record account transitions atomically against the current assignment with attempt-keyed replay and compatible switch reasons.

- 5ef34cf: Allow hosts to open a workbench tab with `openTabRequest`. The stock console routes Site links into the session artifact panel and retains a session return link when expanding Sites or editors full-page.

## 5.0.5

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/sdk@5.0.5

## 5.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 3d9ab25: Keep wide markdown tables stable while subsequent message text streams by preserving their layout observer and remeasuring content without resetting the expanded width.

## 5.0.3

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/sdk@5.0.3

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 05957ee: Keep the workbench's initial tab unresolved while a signed capture manifest is loading, so pending capture metadata cannot permanently select Files instead of Changes. Preserve host overrides, settled empty/error fallbacks, and the user's later tab selection.

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- be17b8e: Remove the SDK Skill loader capability and use eager sandbox-free Skill reading
  with a turn-prepared descriptor index. Keep on-demand checkout and repository
  Skill discovery separate, and render Skill tool calls consistently in the timeline.

## 5.0.0

### Minor Changes

- f8be7df: Allow hosts to render inline connection setup for timeline authentication requests. Add an optional safe return path to Fiken OAuth so setup can return to the originating conversation.
- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 39adecb: Let top-level assistant tables expand into available chat panel space while keeping surrounding text at its normal reading width. Tables remain contained when a side panel opens or the conversation is narrow, and keep horizontal scrolling when content still cannot fit.
- 1b0f4f2: Expose unavailable background command observations separately from command lifecycle state, and render that uncertainty in command and session status.
- 87fbd92: Preserve full session messages and tool output through database paging, compact
  event delivery, SSE, browser rendering, and copying. Remove browser per-event
  preview truncation while retaining history pagination and backpressure. Events
  larger than a page or loaded-window byte target are delivered intact on their own.
- Updated dependencies [1b0f4f2]
  - @opengeni/sdk@4.0.2

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 068be26: Complete a Skill save in the same transaction as its one verified human chat decision. Show the full immutable Skill folder, preserve exact scope and revision checks, and refuse delegated, stale, or mismatched approval. Autonomous saves activate directly; declining a proposal preserves existing active guidance.
- d1cb266: Keep automatic history filling from evicting the latest reply or cycling between older and newer pages. Preserve explicit history navigation and stable jumps back to latest. Retain provider message identity so assistant chunks interleaved with tool activity remain one message without merging distinct replies.
- Updated dependencies [068be26]
- Updated dependencies [2fa33e4]
  - @opengeni/sdk@4.0.1

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- c915b0f: Remove the separate `@opengeni/react/chat` component. Use the existing
  `SessionConversation` or compose the timeline and composer for the full agent
  experience. The server-side `@opengeni/sdk/chat` wrapper and adapters remain
  unchanged; their protocol requires a custom or compatible frontend.

### Minor Changes

- 9827c25: Add message action slots and an optional source message boundary for managed-human forks. The web UI places turn feedback and Fork from here beside Copy and the timestamp. Message forks preserve existing authorization and idempotency, copy only the selected canonical history prefix, and reject ambiguous, compacted, or incomplete boundaries.

  Migration 0429 requires draining the API and both worker pools and provisioning the updated runtime routine contract before starting the new binary.

### Patch Changes

- 0c5e2fd: Group composer timeline annotations into one count chip, pin numbered badges on the quoted source text, and keep Add note available for long highlights that end in message chrome. Dense and long notes stay in a viewport-clamped review list, overlapping badges pack onto distinct in-viewport points instead of stacking, Enter moves to the next empty note, and sent cards collapse instead of growing without bound.
- 231b103: Apply explicit Codex account switches and unpins to capacity-blocked turns, preserving the same turn and history through recovery. Display current account selection separately from future preferences and report when a switch requests a capacity recheck.
- 9d36a0f: Keep the latest streamed answer visible outside collapsed steps when an input wait ends a turn without final output.

  - @opengeni/sdk@4.0.0

## 3.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- 107aa14: Support standard SDK/React conversations in Sites and sandbox previews, direct
  HTML/source uploads, exact deployment package pins, and embedded layout/queue
  defaults. Refresh exhausted Grok capacity after external resets.

### Patch Changes

- 0ca6728: Label child-result receipts without claiming task completion, explain pending input, and let hosts open the exact child from incoming and delivered updates.
- fa2b99a: Preserve workflow wake retries until pending input is admitted, while future waits stay parked at their deadline, and expose current session waits and waiting descendant counts. Refresh wait status on live events and retain the status projection sequence so newer session reads cannot be overwritten by older events.
- 1fc0889: Group deployment-provided models under OpenGeni regardless of upstream provider. Badge only explicitly free models, keep paid rows compact, and preserve separate workspace, organization, and subscription connections with accurate payment descriptions.
- e271780: Replace nested model selection with a searchable list grouped by payment source. Select models immediately, keep thinking and speed controls visible in the picker footer, and preserve supported settings when switching models. Prioritize model names in compact composer controls.
- 952331e: Restore click-to-expand previews for ready image attachments after their composer remounts, while keeping signed preview URL creation lazy.
- ecffc88: Use the selected appearance for message-detail backgrounds instead of the operating system theme.
- 8be8a72: Show failed live-file wake requests with a retry that renegotiates the workspace, instead of leaving a permanent waking spinner. Preview complete PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP files without enabling binary editing or waking machines during passive capture browsing.
- ba890d1: Keep selected models in their provider groups, consolidate subscription descriptions, and simplify reasoning controls. Show image compatibility warnings only when a draft contains images.
- 730b78b: Identify the goal explicitly in compact status chips so its state is distinct from the session status.
- e9d092a: Resolve goal landmark icons when rendered so circular production chunks cannot leave continuation rows permanently unavailable.
- ca2b4e2: Offer the session-chrome queue when chrome is idle and at least one authoritative prompt is waiting. Closing it dismisses that session until occupancy drains; a different session on the same chrome instance may still offer. A live Send stays a paint-only chip receipt.
- 3673900: Preserve reading position during session history pagination, keep folded history loading, and prevent false retries across stream reconnects.
- 3a29372: Keep embedded conversation foreground and background theme-matched. Support filtering published Sites by creating or publishing session for the session Artifacts panel.
- eeb5500: Label preserved wait outcomes with their recorded date and time and expose them as static notes, keeping historical agent text distinct from current session state.
- 0f3dc9a: Keep an unpinned timeline reader in place when older history prepends into a compact tail. Restoring the row offset no longer looks like a scroll back to the live tip, so the view does not snap to the bottom after loading earlier messages.
- fe73da9: Keep hidden composer height measurement out of document overflow after responsive resizing. Allow session chrome hosts to identify an active goal blocked by failed session execution without changing the goal state.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.
- f0f1e17: Keep a durable wait reason visible after a tool-only turn settles, including legacy goal holds, while preserving collapsed step detail and recovering missing or partial terminal responses from authoritative turn output.

## 3.7.0

### Patch Changes

- 6b65383: Replace goal-scoped long waits with self-only session-level `wait_for_input`, add provider-neutral `command_wait`, and deliver terminal background-command proof as exactly-once durable agent input with workflow wakes for nonterminal sessions while preserving event-only audit for terminal sessions.
- 6f84c02: Make durable Codex credential leasing unconditional, preserve rotation-off as an active-account-only capacity policy, and recover definitive credential failures through same-turn failover or durable capacity waiting.
- Updated dependencies [6b65383]
- Updated dependencies [6f84c02]
  - @opengeni/sdk@3.7.0

## 3.6.0

### Patch Changes

- d63ee0f: Keep Connected Machine file links in the target's canonical filesystem namespace, including Windows drive and UNC roots, and reject stale file requests with a retryable route conflict.
- fab39d2: Keep lazy session-history reads sub-second on large sessions by fitting each browser window and its continuation lookahead into one byte- and count-bounded database query instead of walking the page through sequential reads. Fresh and foreground tail loads may use one additional bounded page to preserve a complete turn boundary, and foreground replacement keeps the prior timeline visible until the new window is ready.

## 3.4.1

### Patch Changes

- a8da2c5: Stabilize release admission checks under loaded CI runners.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.
- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.
- dd98677: Fail browser uploads before any network request with a typed `secure_context_required` error when HTTPS-only Web Crypto is unavailable, and surface actionable HTTPS guidance directly on failed attachment cards.
- 9af1666: Keep backward session-history pagination advancing across oversized legacy events by applying the canonical bounded read projection instead of failing the page, and report when a forensic response is no longer byte-for-byte exact.

- fd05df1: Cancel abandoned session detail, lineage, and goal reads after their final mounted consumer leaves while preserving shared reads for consumers that are still active.
- 7988c84: Fence the initiating browser tab before account-changing mutations and cancel abandoned session-page, draft, turn-policy, model-catalog, and realtime-catalog reads without interrupting remaining shared consumers.

### Patch Changes

- ff4af61: Promote a normal human Send to Steer-equivalent replacement when an active session is waiting for human action, cancelling the stale decision surface and placing the conversational message directly in chat.
- 0bbaee2: Harden live and historical session timelines: preserve reader ownership through cumulative pointer movement and animated layout shrink, keep bidirectional history windows density-bounded and compact-cursor correct, schedule large window swaps without blocking the browser, and prevent unmatched tool outputs from settling unrelated calls.

- c525324: Add clickable composer attachment previews through the shared route-level lightbox with safe retained object-URL lifetimes, localized preview and lightbox control messages, full-chat file drag-and-drop affordances, and the updated reduced-motion-aware working indicator.

### Patch Changes

- c52c841: Show the timeline's Jump to latest control while a pinned session is catching up from meaningful pre-existing tip debt.
- 3887ad2: Bound composer draft read retries and ignore unchanged soft-reload projections to prevent request feedback loops during reconnects and transient gateway failures.
- 3a004ff: Preserve optional structured human-input answers, replay terminal settlements idempotently, and retain Slack replies when expiry or cancellation wins a response race.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d4edd4: Add a public atomic composer application command shared by HTTP and in-process hosts, including atomic host-authorized resource augmentation without a trusted draft rewrite; add a receiver-safe narrow React session client constructor with host submit overrides and draft projection; and add presentation-only file-node filtering across the packaged workbench surfaces.
- 986f5fe: Add provider-neutral browser login session sets with bounded independently revocable slots, explicit actor switching, isolated add and re-authentication, scoped logout, non-enumerating cross-slot deep-link recovery, and rolling legacy/dual/broker compatibility.

### Patch Changes

- f1f7c22: Keep controlled composer inputs on the latest local draft while older autosave settlements render.
- 720ca4a: Render controlled composer edits synchronously before deferred host delivery settles.
- 27f3364: Clear ordinary Send drafts before host submission callbacks can re-project the submitted text.
- 82e72ce: Preserve the latest controlled composer edit across synchronous child-controller renders.
- 1135a6b: Keep pinned session streaming at the rendered layout tip so the viewport no longer reveals already-rendered output through a delayed catch-up glide.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.

### Patch Changes

- 85e4f3c: Release committed older-history pagination ownership when projected rows stay unchanged, while preserving the legacy public callback return compatibility.
- d741f38: Make fresh session reads generation-aware, expose authoritative detail and list read revisions plus causal read generations, and keep retained pagination and independently polled pinned projections from overriding newer session channel authority.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: `requireSessionAuthorization` denies `session.approval.write` to every agent attempt on every surface: tool approvals stay human-only, while structured human input (`session.human_input.write`) remains answerable by a live attempt. The React queue chrome and timeline label the new child lifecycle notice kinds (`child_requires_action`, `child_requires_action_resolved`, `child_paused`, `child_waiting_capacity`, `child_progress`) instead of dropping them.
- 5d664d8: Surface why a goal is not pursuing and how long children have waited for a human. `Session.treeStats` gains optional `attentionSince` (earliest `requires_action` entry among the counted attention descendants), `Session` gains optional `requiresActionSince` on list and lineage reads, and the goal continuation projection gains optional `holdReason` for a `held_for_input` hold. `SessionChrome`'s goal pill spells out the pause reason ("Paused · cap" / "budget" / "by you" / "agent"), explains an idle-backoff check time and an agent `goal_wait` hold, and exports `sessionChromeGoalPillLabel` / `sessionChromeGoalPillExplanation`.

### Patch Changes

- e6ffdc7: Add the `backoff_pending` goal continuation reason (idle pacing between consecutive no-input continuations, `nextAttemptAt` at the pacing deadline) and the `SessionGoalResumedReason` / `SessionGoalResumedEventPayload` contracts for `goal.resumed` (`api` for the operator PATCH, `external_input` for the system resume of a `max_auto_continuations` pause). The React goal pill treats `backoff_pending` as ordinary scheduled work.
- 5e9795c: Derive Connected Machine list state from the durable heartbeat cursor instead of a live ControlRpc ping on every `GET /machines`, and share one `useMachines` poll per workspace+session.
- acd38d1: Retire Browser and Desktop resources when their source task leaves the Connected Machine that owns their controller, stop retrying the terminal placement conflict, and let Desktop create one replacement on the task's current placement.
- e91d89e: Open Markdown `sandbox:` file links in the current session's Files workbench, preserve exact decoded paths through the selected filesystem authority, reveal deep lazy-tree ancestors, and handle malformed references safely.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ab81e47]
  - @opengeni/sdk@2.1.1

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- fbc760e: Add the first-party `goal_wait` MCP tool and a durable goal continuation hold.
  An orchestrator whose active goal depends on child sessions or an external
  event records a bounded hold (reason plus mandatory deadline, at most 7 days)
  with a `goal.held` timeline fact instead of busy-polling. The continuation
  materializer returns `held` while the declaring turn is still the latest
  finished turn and the deadline is ahead: it never consumes the goal wake
  revision and re-arms a delayed workflow wake at the deadline on every idle
  evaluation. Pending machine input wins with `queue`, and any newer finished
  turn, a passed deadline, or a human/API/agent goal mutation clears the hold.
  The goal projection reports a current hold as `blocked` / `held_for_input`
  with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline (rolling migration 0317).
- c9faa51: Replace the horizontally scrolling workspace tabs with a responsive vertical
  activity rail, add a panel-local Hide workspace action, and distinguish managed
  sleeping compute from genuinely offline Connected Machines.

### Patch Changes

- 66593eb: Reconcile and verify the session-list visibility predicate grant when a fresh
  deployment runs migrations before creating its restricted application role,
  and keep app-supplied composer controls shrinkable within a single footer row.
- 650d6f9: Route OpenSandbox browser and computer streams through the API frame-proxy so the workbench can show live JPEG/RFB when the lifecycle proxy cannot carry browserd WebSocket grants.
- 52456f9: Expose the personal-resource attachment contracts from the SDK and preserve
  atomic attachment intent through durable React composer Send/Steer delivery,
  including exact uncertain retries and authoritative stale-epoch
  reconfirmation. The managed web console can now choose fixed personal Variable
  Sets and Rigs for create and attach them with once, session, or always scope.
- 5880ec8: Keep channel/project hooks cache-coherent across mounted consumers, including immediate confirmed-create projections with stale-read protection and failure rollback.
- 428300c: Open agent `sandbox:/workspace/...:line` links in the Files workbench at that line, and accept `/workspace/...` hrefs as the same session-local file shape.
- 0e5a644: Keep structured human-input decisions in the main conversation: pending forms
  render at the timeline tip, settled history preserves both the agent's question
  and the human's readable answer, the duplicate generic Ask step is omitted, and
  every choice question offers an inline Other answer without losing exact text.
- 7918925: Keep optimistic user messages continuously mounted while their canonical durable events arrive, and show actionable delivery failures without an ordinary sending label.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f61d6e: Mint public `wss` live-view proxy URLs behind TLS terminators. Drain existing sandbox leases even when ownership is off. Treat ownership-disabled stream-capabilities as no live sandbox.
- 21728f0: Preserve in-progress structured human-input answers when live session updates refresh the same pending request.
- Updated dependencies [6f61d6e]
  - @opengeni/sdk@2.0.1

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c78ed0: Separate new-session and established-session composer policy authority. Exact draft submission now atomically freezes queued-turn text, resources, model, reasoning, and latency, then rotates the server draft; queue Edit restores that exact snapshot and stale revisions surface as conflicts instead of silent rebases.

### Patch Changes

- 5dc88ef: Terminalize attached Chrome Browser/Computer sessions when the device connection generation changes, stop Reconnect from retrying the stale placement, and physically stop ScreenCaptureKit helpers so replayd cannot accumulate.
- Updated dependencies [1c78ed0]
- Updated dependencies [79ee99b]

  - @opengeni/sdk@2.0.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b05130a: Hard-cut editable spreadsheets to authored-only canonical state, deterministic formula projections, and explicit current compatibility protocols. Preserve React compatibility with artifact-tool 0.1 and 0.2 while adding the 0.3 line.

### Patch Changes

- 0a6c577: Keep periodic workspace snapshots off the first provider-request critical path, clarify the overlapping runtime/model-preparation timing in the session timeline, and promote the complete signed Agent 0.1.16 bundle as the default stable installer target.
- Updated dependencies [b05130a]
  - @opengeni/sdk@1.2.0

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/sdk@1.1.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f860f0: Add durable publication and authenticated download support for session sandbox files. Agents can publish bounded `/workspace` outputs through a first-party tool, raw sandbox links can recover through the session API, retained file receipts render with downloads, and retained screenshots expose an explicit download action.

### Patch Changes

- 987742d: Reduce turn-start overhead without reducing admitted history, rig variables, or
  user-visible content. Active history loads in one admitted query, automatic
  compaction skips duplicate history work below threshold, unchanged Codex
  credential pointers avoid redundant session-activity writes, rig defaults
  load at bounded concurrency for admitted worker attempts, and the attempt-scoped
  MCP wrapper no longer reuses a broader process-global tool list.

  Improve large-session interaction by measuring rich-message disclosure without
  a second React commit, showing truthful pending queue actions immediately, and
  replacing the false zero-step placeholder with the session's real lifecycle.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 2a69f65: Keep versioned direct-session web builds within the measured release bundle contract.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e0e0102: Unify browser, computer, identity, realtime, and Codemode behavior across managed sandboxes and connected machines.
- 4d1ed07: Preserve complete bounded lazy-search tool schemas across durable model history, expose Linux desktop application launch when the image supports it, suppress the managed Chrome sandbox warning, label Computer sessions as Desktops in the UI, and keep AnyDoc available in headed desktop sandboxes.
- 79f57b5: Present an active goal yielding to a foreground human turn as waiting instead of blocked, and keep active-goal elapsed time advancing.
- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- d34dd9a: Add revision-fenced per-command memory and CPU policies for Connected Machines, exact live runner capability gating, and lifecycle-safe Linux operation accounting without introducing default resource limits.

### Patch Changes

- 8bb860b: Keep embedded client configurations synchronized with the exported API contract revision and document the fail-closed host integration boundary.
- Updated dependencies [8bb860b]
  - @opengeni/sdk@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 083387e: Replace the removed per-turn `turnInstructions` system-prefix contract with generic per-message `modelContext` content. This is a breaking release-train cutover: old mutating clients are rejected after migration 0240. Context now enters canonical user history without standard timeline rendering, preserves the persistent prompt-cache prefix, and works across initial, queued, steer, realtime delegation, and transcript handoff paths.

### Patch Changes

- 1ef18cc: Deduplicate realtime model catalog loads and reuse settled catalogs across embedded control remounts.
- Updated dependencies [083387e]
- Updated dependencies [11913b7]
  - @opengeni/sdk@1.0.0

## 0.57.0

### Patch Changes

- d86610d: Prevent deterministic model-generated worker-spawn failures, hide exhausted nested-agent creation, and show bounded structured session orchestration diagnostics in worker timeline rows while preserving the advanced public REST/SDK create contract.
- d86610d: Run published HTML artifacts as exact source in an opaque-origin sandbox, raise their UTF-8 ceiling to 4 MiB, and expose reusable React rendering. Add deployment-configurable default and allowed built-in session tools plus configured shared-key delegation fallback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b0b2bed]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.56.0

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- 8beed26: Add managed-human organization membership discovery. Expose the exact active
  self-membership and personal-workspace identity returned by the existing
  narrow provisioning capability through a managed-session-only API route and
  typed SDK method, while denying delegated/API-key principals and terminal
  memberships.

### Patch Changes

- @opengeni/sdk@0.53.1

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- d2def0c: Add the complete browser-native and semantic computer interaction system across managed sandboxes, Connected Machines, attached Chrome, and external browser placements. Ship durable browser identities, authentication repair, network routing, downloads/uploads, shared causal control, public SDK and React workbench surfaces, and one exact MCP/Codemode execution catalog with native Connected Machine access.

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.52.0

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- 76e54a9: Keep mobile voice-input Cancel and Stop controls visible while recording in crowded composer footers.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.
- 90eea29: Make connected-machine removal show every dependent session and support an explicit canonical move-to-default-sandbox confirmation before revocation. Default moves prove managed sandbox readiness through the existing fleet route, active turns remain fail-closed, and typed swap rejections surface as visible errors instead of false success.

  requests, and a GitHub owner-consent flow that returns to the initiating session.
- d1189ba: Add the OpenGeni-owned document, spreadsheet, and presentation authoring engine,
  its durable API/domain/live-sync surfaces, first-party React workbench, and
  editable-artifact client SDK. Publish independently lazy, identity-pinned browser
  WASM runtimes for each editor modality.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [fed43cf]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.48.0

## 0.47.1

### Patch Changes

- 5dfb93d: Keep derived design tokens available through both the compiled stylesheet and the Tailwind source bridge while sharing compact public fallbacks, so SessionChrome retains its complete default presentation without duplicating color formulas in application bundles.

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.46.6

## 0.46.5

### Patch Changes

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.46.4

## 0.46.4

### Patch Changes

- b783f12: Keep optional MCP setup authentication out of unrelated chat timelines while preserving actionable tool-call reconnect events.
- 34c5cdb: Retain validated computer screenshots as authenticated, integrity-checked session artifacts with bounded event/history receipts, SDK range assembly, and React rendering while preserving historical inline-image compatibility.

  receipts; add bounded scheduled-task list/detail projections and preserve worker
  session references across receipt and legacy timeline results.
- Updated dependencies [5d1d0c2]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.46.2

## 0.46.1

### Patch Changes

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.44.3

## 0.44.2

- 48ae722: Smooth tip-follow camera and streaming timeline motion (settle folds, tool enter, fence soft-close).
- Updated dependencies [c52acc0]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.32.1

## 0.32.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f413e6c]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.32.0

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 42428a2: Add per-session Codex remote compaction v2 (`remote_v2` / `portable`), with UI landmarks, Codex-only model locking, and opaque token accounting aligned to Codex CLI.

### Patch Changes

- b2e975f: Advance the merged knowledge release train to fresh publication identities without changing runtime behavior. This corrective source is derived from current main and does not reuse generated release output.
- Updated dependencies [0199108]
- Updated dependencies [42428a2]
- Updated dependencies [b2e975f]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.31.0

## Unreleased

- Copy affordances: fenced code + tables in `Markdown`, hover copy on user/assistant messages, and "Copy turn" on settled turn chips (includes the lifted final answer).
- Session timeline history navigation: `loadOldest` / `loadNewer` / `jumpToLatest` on `useSessionEvents`, plus Jump to start / Jump to latest chrome on `MessageTimeline` (bounded windows; no middle gap walk).
- Add `SessionChrome` — production/embed session-signal dock (incoming / queue / goal / agents) with token overrides (`--og-session-chrome-*`), token tooltips, crossfade panel switches, and queue hover actions wired to `UseTurnQueueResult`. Replaces stacked `QueueSurface` + host goal/agents chrome in the web session route.
- Export shared `Tooltip*` primitives used by SessionChrome (portal-token aware).
- Fix SessionChrome tooltips: inverted tip surface uses inline fg/bg so `.og-root` cannot blank the text; tip only icon actions; Steer copy matches QueueSurface (`Make this the next direction`).
- Light ChatComposer spacing/token freshen (quieter focus border, tighter footer/input padding).
- Replace host-adapter composer transcription with native MediaRecorder capture and immediate server transcription.
- Compact composer voice chrome: live/fallback waveform, separate cancel vs stop-and-transcribe actions, and a quieter transcribing state.

## 0.30.2

### Patch Changes

- 84fb671: Prevent a ready file restored during reconnect from being counted twice across the durable composer draft and the still-live attachment card. Canonical duplicate refs are removed before draft persistence and composer submission while custom mounts and exact draft revision/content conflict protection remain intact.
- 96eb64b: Advance the reviewed knowledge release package graph to fresh publishable identities after the previous version projection was invalidated. This changes release metadata only and does not alter runtime behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 8dca209: Remove redundant success glyphs from collapsed turn summaries while preserving failed, cancelled, and active state indicators.
- 821f664: Seed shared session-event cursors from loaded history to prevent historical replay storms, and preserve the MCP SDK's exact request-timeout classification through safe transport-error sanitization.

## 0.29.2

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.29.0

## 0.29.1

### Patch Changes

- 8478e60: Default workspace-tracking sessions to every configured MCP server while
  preserving exact explicit API allow-lists. Keep OpenGeni's internal carrier and
  default-on Files surface out of the web picker's visible choices and counts.
  Settle provider-native web searches from their own terminal status, render each
  web action truthfully, keep completed searches before the answer they informed,
  and hide unresolved private citation handles from the human timeline.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [33dc88f]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.29.0

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- 1c4018e: Replace one-turn tool overrides with one durable session tool policy, expose
  OpenGeni-native tools in the same selection, default available tools on, and
  render delivered machine inputs as compact typed timeline updates instead of
  raw protocol JSON.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 29ad09b: Persist typed machine inputs into canonical model history at turn claim, expose
  authoritative pending-input queue projections and lifecycle events, render
  delivered batches in the timeline, and preserve append-only prompt-cache
  prefixes across tools, later turns, recovery, and explicit compaction.

### Patch Changes

- 8eaa377: Add per-timeline `add`, `remove`, and `replace` customization for collapsed turn summary facets while preserving the existing defaults.

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.26.3

## 0.26.2

### Patch Changes

- f92af07: Give each session-only React hook an exact structural client contract so embedded hosts can use session reads, goals, lineage, file attachments, structured human input, and MCP approval policies without implementing unrelated composer, queue, workspace, or workbench APIs.

## 0.26.1

### Patch Changes

- ffd246c: Keep workspace-capture Git status, diffs, and untracked files below provider retained-output limits, and publish an explicit degraded revision instead of an authoritative empty diff when repository reads fail.
- Updated dependencies [ffd246c]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.26.1

  - @opengeni/sdk@0.25.0

## 0.25.0

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ed0f01: Add per-member session pin preferences with isolated server persistence, bounded/reused stable
  pagination snapshots, snapshot-free pin polling, typed SDK and React reconciliation, and accessible
  list and header controls.

### Patch Changes

- 744a93d: Add default-off, bounded adaptive Codex fleet decision telemetry with strict deterministic replay, cache-aware and work-conserving policy simulation, secret-safe event/UI observability, and independent future policy gates.
- Updated dependencies [744a93d]
- Updated dependencies [0ed0f01]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.24.0

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

- Updated dependencies [ff23da5]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.21.1

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d1dee7a]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.21.0

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f84cc9: Add durable host-provided per-turn instructions, headless structured-input hooks, host-local queue
  focus, and reusable approval and human-input surfaces for embedded session consumers.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9f84cc9]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.20.0

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 3aee519: Add a workspace-accepted, provider-agnostic transcription policy and host-adapter contract, plus an accessible composer microphone that keeps partials ephemeral and appends non-empty accepted finals to the editable draft exactly once. Policies explicitly accept automatic language detection and speaker diarization, events can carry strict neutral result metadata, pending starts and cleanup are abortable/bounded, and adapter failures stay behind controlled UI copy with redacted non-UI diagnostics.

### Patch Changes

- 136227e: Add an immutable, versioned curated skill library with explicit workspace selection and inspectable provenance, and preserve WCAG AA contrast for dark-theme primary actions.
- Updated dependencies [136227e]
- Updated dependencies [3aee519]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.19.0

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 5547b2f: Let embedders allowlist Changes, Files, Terminal, and Desktop workbench surfaces while keeping disabled surfaces behaviorally dormant.
- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- 2dfd415: Let embedders keep composer drafts in local React state while leaving message, attachment, steer, and control behavior active. Queue checkout is withheld because its atomic API contract necessarily creates a durable composer draft.
- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 4498714: Preserve tool names and arguments when projecting serialized approval items through the session-only React API.
- 51f45a3: Publish the session-only React entry point and typed session control surface in a stable registry release.
- 44ff327: Fence queue, composer, and control hook state to the active workspace and session so target switches cannot expose or accept stale private state.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 717a7ef: Add a headless chat-composer controller, compound composer primitives, and typed message overrides while preserving `ChatComposer` as the default preset.
- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- bb09be8: Add a session-only React entrypoint and mirror MCP approval policy in
  the public SDK type.
- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.
- Updated dependencies [bb09be8]
- Updated dependencies
- Updated dependencies [dbb6232]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.17.0

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 4e9c48c: Preserve the exact autosaved composer text when sending or steering so trailing whitespace cannot trip the draft consistency fence.
- 9a7dec2: Keep captured workspace files and diffs usable when the live sandbox provider is temporarily unavailable, surface a truthful retryable degraded state, and distinguish provider failures from invalid workspace paths.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0697a: Ship the production-hardened captured workspace workbench, physically verified Steer/Pause cancellation across cloud, local, and self-hosted model tools, pre-model preparation, sandbox provisioning, and lifecycle/setup commands, durable quiescence admission fencing, cancellation-aware SDK reads and turn cleanup, single-round-trip pruned workspace indexing, truthful shutdown states, a responsive and accessible review dock, Unicode coverage, and package-safe CSS/SSR integration.

### Patch Changes

- 14ce2e3: Bound model-facing textual tool output with Codex-compatible, replay-idempotent semantics, account
  for complete current model input, make compaction failure/progress transitions
  durable and convergent, and replace recursive session discovery with a compact
  paginated projection.
- Updated dependencies [ec0697a]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.16.0

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f42cd4a: Replace the old queue and interruption surface with one revisioned prompt queue, durable composer drafts, atomic Steer, recursive Pause/Resume, workspace control invalidation, stale-client contract fencing, and a shared accessible queue UI for first- and third-party consumers. Remove the obsolete passive child-notification setting so every child terminal result follows the one bounded, coalescible internal-update contract.
- 0399277: Add a per-machine telemetry detail view and upgrade the machine cards. The card now leads with a fused health verdict (connection + resource pressure + sample freshness), previews a CPU trend, and shows live freshness; opening a card reveals full metric history (CPU, memory, disk, load, GPU) over 15m/1h/6h/24h with threshold guides and a hover crosshair — rendering the downsampled series the API already served but nothing consumed. Resource meters now read as a coherent green/amber/red traffic-light aligned with the health verdict, and load average renders neutral (it is not core-normalized) with the run queue carrying the real saturation signal.

### Patch Changes

- 215d01d: Render normalized persisted MCP text outputs in custom timeline tool cards.
- Updated dependencies [f42cd4a]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.15.0

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- dc79905: Harden the workspace dock with persistent tab state, authoritative live-versus-capture defaults, accessible mobile navigation, guarded-file routing, and deterministic browser acceptance coverage.

## 0.13.0

### Patch Changes

- 7a7126d: Fence session events, workspace capture, file tree, git state, warm intents, and tab latches by session identity; bound signed-manifest fetches; refresh same-shape diffs when hunk content changes; and clear stale file metadata during reconciliation.
- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- fbf029c: Make the workspace dock usable on narrow and touch surfaces: replace the cramped two-column diff with an identity-stable changed-file picker, preserve selection across reordered captures, provide accessible target sizes for dock and file controls, and raise text/diff contrast to WCAG 2.2 AA.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.
- 810542f: Commit workspace capture announcements atomically with their revision rows and keep harmless late capture bookkeeping out of the user timeline.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f0ce46c: Credit exhaustion renders as a first-class failure with a top-up CTA (was: silent idle). A budget-exhausted `turn.completed` (`segmentLimit: "budget_exhausted"` / `detail: "insufficient OpenGeni credits"`) now projects as a failed turn-end plus a failed notice instead of a clean completed turn, and `turn.failed` credit errors collapse to one canonical sentence via `humanizeFailureReason`. New exports: `isCreditExhaustion`, `creditExhaustedFromEvents`, and `CREDIT_EXHAUSTION_MESSAGE`. The web console (unversioned app) rides along: a credit-specific banner with an "Add credits" link to organization settings — shown also on idle sessions whose last turn died of budget exhaustion — replacing the "send a message to revive" copy that cannot work without credits.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

- Updated dependencies [602db89]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.11.0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

- 351665b: Completed activity clusters of a still-running turn now fold behind neutral chips (facets + a quiet pulse dot; no verdict glyph — the turn has none yet), keeping only the live tail expanded. This bounds the DOM of very long autonomous turns the same way settled folding bounds history; on settle, everything collapses into the single turn fold as before. TurnSummary's `outcome` prop is now optional (absent = in-progress cluster).

### Patch Changes

- 550b055: Fresh-eyes review fixes: sandbox command output uses its canonical `chunk` wire field end-to-end — the projection and the compact coalescer previously read only legacy `text`/`output`, so compact history windows dropped terminal output entirely (and the resume cursor skipped the raw events that carried it); coalesced sandbox runs now also break on stream and commandId so stdout/stderr never merge. Live-cluster folding is re-based on the true invariants: a cluster with running/streaming items never folds, and folding happens only when the NEXT group is agent progress (activity/turn/narration) — so a pending queued message or an approval pause no longer folds the work the reader needs in view.
- Updated dependencies [7bfe593]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.10.0

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- ea8757a: The timeline projection's event-grammar contract is now pinned by a golden fixture suite (8 realistic event-log fixtures → committed projection snapshots, including compact/raw equivalence and legacy/malformed tolerance). Intentional grammar changes regenerate snapshots so the diff is reviewed; unintentional ones fail CI.
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.9.0

## 0.9.0

### Patch Changes

- 445fb78: First paint of a session is now a single compact fetch (deeper history loads via the scroll sentinel), and the hook exposes `initialLoading` so hosts can suppress genesis fallbacks while the tail window is still fetching — on large sessions the web console painted the session's initial message at the top for the whole fetch.
- Updated dependencies [e513236]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.9.0

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 3d708b5: Add compact event replay support for history windows and switch React session-event loading to capped compact pages with coalesced-delta resume cursors.
- Updated dependencies [3d708b5]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.8.0

## 0.7.0

- 068c647: A no-op pinned-follow scroll assignment left the programmatic-scroll mark set (no scroll event fires to consume it), which made the reader's next real scroll-up read as programmatic and get eaten — the view snapped back to the bottom and upward backfill could never engage. The mark now self-clears when an assignment doesn't move the scroller.
- d84eef8: Session load and backfill no longer flicker: the timeline stays invisible until its first bottom-anchored frame (a flash of the window top is structurally impossible), rows decide at mount whether they animate so bulk paints never replay entrance animations across the timeline, the scroller disables native browser scroll anchoring (it fought the reader-anchor corrections during backfill), and programmatic scroll echoes can no longer unpin the bottom-follow (which could strand the view just short of the bottom).

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- a63bc1f: Anchor queued user messages at the turn that actually executes them in the timeline projection, show still-pending queued messages quietly, and ignore cancellation events for queued turns that never started.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- d935316: The timeline no longer renders queued / running / idle status dividers — they are machinery telemetry the header pill, live shimmer, and turn-chip duration facet already carry. Only attention-worthy statuses (requires_action, failed, cancelled) still earn a divider. Applies retroactively to historical traces since the filter lives in the pure projection.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a4f370f: Carve the connected-machine UI into a dedicated `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and add `workingDir` to the SDK create-session request.

  - **`@opengeni/react`**: the bring-your-own-compute surface (`useMachines`, `MachinesDashboard`, `MachineCard`, `MachineDockBar`, `SharedMachineDisclosure`, `MachineStatusPill`, `ConnectionStatusPill`, `ConnectionDot`, `MachineMetrics`, `EnrollmentDeviceFlow`, `EnrollmentConsent`, `connectionStatusForState`, and the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MachineKind` / `MachinesResponse` / `MetricSample` view-model types) now lives at `@opengeni/react/machines`. The root keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility — **non-breaking** — but the root re-export is **deprecated** and will move in a future major. Import from `@opengeni/react/machines` going forward.
  - **`@opengeni/sdk`**: `CreateSessionRequest` gains an optional `workingDir?: string` field — the host working directory for a connected-machine target (the agent runs there; defaults to the machine's launch dir). Ignored for managed sandboxes.

- d9d7743: Render the self-hosted desktop stream: a PNG-frame canvas client for `transport: "relay-frames"`.

  Self-hosted machines stream their desktop as PNG-per-frame protobuf datagrams over the relay (not RFB), so the noVNC/RFB viewer could never render them — the desktop went "warm" but the live stream never came up. This adds `useRelayFrameStream`, a view-only canvas renderer that opens the relay channel, decodes each PNG frame, and paints it (latest-wins backpressure so a slow decode never queues). `useDesktopStream` now dispatches on `DesktopStream.transport`: `"vnc-ws"` → noVNC (Modal boxes), `"relay-frames"` → the frame renderer (self-hosted machines). The `DesktopStream.transport` / `client` unions gain `"relay-frames"` / `"frames"`. View-only in v1 (matches the machine's read-only mode); interactive input is a follow-up.

- ccebacd: Completed, failed, and cancelled turns now fold their activity behind a TurnSummary chip in MessageTimeline, with failed turns starting expanded so their failure text remains visible.
- 5a289d0: Settled turns now collapse the entire turn span behind one summary chip, leaving only the final agent message visible until expanded. Expanding the chip reveals mid-turn narration and nested per-cluster activity summaries.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1c82c5: Add the world-class timeline tool-call renderer module and the sandbox workspace client surface to `@opengeni/react`.

  - **Timeline renderers**: per-tool disclosure cards (full-row toggle, keyboard-accessible), screenshots → lightbox, theme-aware Pierre diffs, turn-collapse summary chips, sub-agent worker/goal landmarks, a consumer-extensible tool registry, and complete state handling (running / complete / failed / cancelled), each with its own affordance.
  - **Sandbox surfacing**: file/terminal/git/desktop hooks and components (`useSandboxFiles`, `useSandboxTerminal`, `useSandboxGit`, `useDesktopStream`, `useTerminalStream`, `useSessionCapabilities`, `SandboxFiles`, `SandboxTerminal`, `DesktopViewer`, `WorkspaceDock`, Pierre diff/file views, `CodeEditor`).

  All additive; `MessageTimeline`'s `items` contract is unchanged. The internal `compactPayloadPreview` helper was removed from the public surface.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- daaffd7: Chat `MessageTimeline` now renders message bodies as **markdown by default** (react-markdown + remark-gfm, themed to the `og-*` design tokens — headings, lists, GFM task lists, inline/fenced code, blockquotes, tables, links). The `renderMessageText` prop still overrides the default renderer.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
