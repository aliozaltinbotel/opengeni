 * includes the follow-on failure after Vite's preload recovery has cancelled
 * the import error and requested a reload: the router then sees an ordinary
 * `TypeError`, but the document has already observed the chunk-load failure.
 * Both actions are full document loads so a failed router state cannot trap
