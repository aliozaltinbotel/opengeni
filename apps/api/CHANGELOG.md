## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f9c757: An organization service key can change an existing external member's
  permissions in one shared workspace without removing and re-adding them:
  `PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/workspaces/:workspaceId/external-members/:membershipId`
  (`updateExternalWorkspaceMember` in the SDK) with `{ operationId, permissions }`.
  It is keyed and idempotent like a grant, capped by the key's permissions, and
  never cancels or tears down work. Narrowing also advances the member's
  organization authorization revision so frozen authority re-checks on next use.
  Rolling migration 0540 adds the `update` action to the external membership
  operation ledger.
- f986809: Scheduled tasks can post to one Slack channel as the OpenGeni workspace bot. A person chooses the channel in the schedule editor ("Post to Slack" under Advanced), stored as `agentConfig.slackBotChannelId` next to `slackBotConnectionId`. Choosing or changing it needs a signed-in person with `connections:write`, and the bot must be a member of an active channel that is not shared with another organization. Agents, services and API keys cannot set or change it. `listScheduledTaskSlackChannels` in the SDK lists the eligible channels.

  Runs of such a task get two tools, `slack_bot_prepare_message` and `slack_bot_send_prepared_message`, which take no channel. Prepare saves the exact text; send posts it to the task's channel with the saved server-owned id as the Slack post operation id, so a retried send never posts twice. Both re-read the task at every call, so clearing or changing the channel takes effect immediately and never redirects an already prepared message. Rolling migration 0530 adds the private prepared-message table and its two capabilities.

- 1ea4c69: Show when a scheduled task's frozen access is out of date, let its owner refresh it, and tell the owner when a run could not use a connector.

  For the task owner (or, for a task without an owner, people who manage schedules), scheduled task reads include a read-only `policyDrift`: workspace default connectors the task lacks, connectors the workspace no longer sets up, default OpenGeni tools missing from an agent-created task's frozen creator policy, connectors whose chosen account can no longer be used, and connectors with no account although one is now available. `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/scheduled-tasks/:taskId/refresh-access` (SDK `refreshScheduledTaskAccess`) re-freezes exactly that with the calling person's current authority through the ordinary owner update path. Only a signed-in person may call it; API keys, services, delegated bearers and agents cannot, a changed task returns 409, and a refreshed creator policy keeps a frozen permission only while that person holds it, adds only the permissions its newly added tools need (within the default worker set and that person's grant), and never changes the creator session policy.

  Scheduled runs whose own turn recorded `tool.auth_needed` carry `accessFailures`, and `GET .../scheduled-tasks/attention` (SDK `listScheduledTaskAccessAttention`) lists schedules whose latest run failed that way until a later run succeeds. It also lists schedules the scheduler refuses before creating a run because a chosen connector account can no longer be used (`unavailableAccounts`, with a null `runId` and `firedAt`), checked at read time with the same account plan as the drift; each item carries the task's `executionDigest`. The web console shows a dot on the Schedules navigation item, a badge on the schedule's row, a notice on the schedule's page with a one-click refresh, and the failure on each run row.

  The refresh accepts an optional `leaveOut` naming default connectors and OpenGeni tools to keep off the schedule; it only narrows what the refresh adds. The schedule page's "Keep without these" hides those defaults in that browser for the reviewed task head and passes them as `leaveOut` when the owner refreshes.

  `@opengeni/contracts` exports `ScheduledTaskPolicyDrift`, `ScheduledTaskAccessConnector`, `ScheduledTaskRunAccessFailure`, `ScheduledTaskAccessAttention`, `ListScheduledTaskAccessAttentionResponse`, and `RefreshScheduledTaskAccessRequest`; `ToolAuthNeededReason` is unchanged but now declared earlier in the module. `@opengeni/db` adds `listScheduledTaskCreatorPolicies`, `listScheduledTaskRunAuthNeededEvents`, `listScheduledTaskAccessAttentionEvents`, `listActiveScheduledTasksWithConnectionAccounts`, and `ScheduledTaskHeadChangedError`, and `updateScheduledTask` accepts `expectedExecutionDigest` and `creatorFirstPartyPolicy`.

- 30414a0: Add the first-party `session_set_model` MCP tool for changing an existing session's future model and reasoning defaults without waking it or rewriting accepted work. Preserve ordinary target authorization and exact-attempt fencing, provide stable idempotent receipts across reconnects, and report canonical model, reasoning and latency settings in full session readback. Share effective defaults across prompt admission, goal continuation, compaction and scheduled snapshots so older queued or resumed turns cannot undo an explicit choice. Deploy API and workers from a matched source cohort before using the new operation.
- b37af05: New Slack tasks post a shorter first message. It is one sentence that links to the session ("OpenGeni started this task", with the routed workspace named inline when routing made a choice) and carries a single Stop button while the task runs. It no longer lists the connectors, repositories and Sandbox Environment the task started with. Stop (or replying `stop`) now swaps the button to Resume on the same message instead of posting a task controls card, and the button leaves the message when the task settles. New tasks have no Status button, no task controls card and no Make recurring link, and later messages in the thread no longer repeat the workspace. The one-time first-task hint is shorter, and `<command> info` suggests asking OpenGeni in the thread to repeat a task on a schedule when the person may and the Slack task tools include scheduling.

  The opening sentence is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0537 adds `slack_interactions.start_message_line`), so repairs and button updates re-render identical bytes for the digest-bound post and update ledgers. Interactions bound before this change keep their previous messages byte for byte, including their Status, Stop and Resume buttons and task controls cards; their control buttons now render from their reserved handles whatever the handles' status, so an acknowledgement repair after a press no longer conflicts. `@opengeni/db` adds `listPendingSlackInteractionMessageActionHandles`, a `supersedeSiblings` option on `settleSlackInteractionActionHandles`, and `startMessageLine` on `SlackInteraction` and `bindSlackInteractionSession`.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/db` `bindSlackInteractionSession` no longer accepts `sessionDefaultsLine` (nothing writes that column any more; existing values are still read), and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`, which only rendered that line, is removed.

- 14990d0: A task started from Slack now starts from what the workspace offers every new session instead of the person's last website composer selection. Connectors follow the workspace default connector policy (including the person's own personal connections when that policy includes connected servers, still executable only through the frozen delegation snapshot), OpenGeni tools follow the workspace default selection, and the Sandbox Environment and its Variable Sets follow the workspace default. Only an explicitly chosen model carries over. Mentions, commands, DMs and shortcuts now always add the read-only Slack context tools, including when the workspace has its own default OpenGeni tool selection; reactions still do not.

  Repositories are the person's own recently used repositories in that workspace: those on the top-level sessions they started there in the last 30 days, most recent first, at most five, and only through their current entry in the workspace GitHub App catalog (same catalog and `github:use` permission as the website picker), on the default branch. Archived and empty repositories are skipped. A person with no recent repositories gets none; GitHub is asked only when there is something to look up, and an outage starts the task without repositories. These repositories are attached best effort.

  Repository resources gain an optional `optional: true` flag (contracts and SDK). A failed clone of such a repository logs a warning, is reported as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone` operation event, and no longer fails sandbox setup; a repository without the flag keeps the strict behavior. `GitHubRepository` gains optional `archived` and `sizeKb`, filled from GitHub when reported.

  The Slack acknowledgement adds one line naming what the task started with, for example `Using connectors: Gmail, Linear; repos: opengeni.` It names only connectors the first accepted turn can reach, so a personal-only connector the person never connected is not claimed. The line is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0529 adds the nullable `slack_interactions.session_defaults_line`), so a repaired acknowledgement re-renders identical bytes. A Slack message or a reacted-to message that links a workspace or session on a different deployment under the same parent domain (for example staging versus production) now carries a model-context note, so the agent says the link is for the other deployment instead of reporting the session as not found.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/core` removes `getActorNewSessionDefaults`. Use `getActorNewSessionModelChoice`, which returns only an explicitly chosen model policy. `@opengeni/db` adds `SlackInteraction.sessionDefaultsLine`, an optional `sessionDefaultsLine` input to `bindSlackInteractionSession` (written only by the bind that wins), `listRecentSessionRepositoryResources`, and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`.

### Patch Changes

- 01f50bf: Add a public, content-free `POST /v1/analytics-consent` beacon that counts
  answers to the web console's optional-analytics banner in
  `opengeni_analytics_consent_total{decision}` (refusals in
  `opengeni_analytics_consent_reports_rejected_total{reason}`), with a streamed
  128-byte body limit, a same-deployment `Origin` check and per-decision
  admission bounds, so product reports can state how much of the audience
  consent-gated analytics never sees. The wire grammar (path, closed `granted` /
  `denied` decision list, and body size limit) is exported from
  `@opengeni/contracts/analytics-consent-report`.
- 3f9c757: Bad client input no longer answers `500`. A request body that fails its schema
  is `400 validation_failed` naming each offending field (malformed JSON too); a
  server-side projection failure stays `500`. An unknown `/v1` method or path
  answers `405` (with `Allow`) or `404` before authentication, instead of the
  retryable `503` the session authorization layer used to return (for example
  `GET .../sessions/:id/tool-policy`). `PATCH /v1/workspaces/:id` with `settings`
  points at `PATCH /v1/workspaces/:id/settings`, and an Integration install whose
  `allowedTools` names a preview `operationKey` (or any unknown value) is a `422`
  listing the valid tool ids and the id each operationKey maps to.
  `PUT /v1/workspaces/external` (`ensureWorkspace`) accepts an omitted
  `accountId` from an organization API key, which creates the workspace in the
  key's own organization; every other caller must still send it.
- 304ddc5: Make the public API compatibility policy explicit and enforced
  (`docs/design/api-compatibility-policy.md`). Deprecated public routes now answer
  with standard `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, and `Link: rel="deprecation"` headers
  (exposed through CORS), and `OpenGeniClient` reports each deprecated route once
  through the new `onDeprecation` option (default: one `console.warn` per route;
  `false` silences it; `parseDeprecationNotice` is exported). The API no longer
  advertises its `x-opengeni-api-contract` revision to a bearer-authenticated
  caller that announced a different one, so published SDKs, which reject any
  other revision on every response, keep working across additive contract bumps.
- 3f9c757: The `x-opengeni-api-contract` fence is now a stale-browser-tab guard only.
  Cookie-authenticated (and unauthenticated local) mutations still need the exact
  revision and receive `409 API_CONTRACT_CHANGED` otherwise, but
  bearer-authenticated callers (API keys, delegated tokens) are admitted with an
  older revision or none, so a backend pinned to an older `@opengeni/sdk` keeps
  working across deployments. A truly breaking revision can still be refused for
  every caller through `REFUSED_API_CONTRACT_REVISIONS`. The SDK gains an
  `apiContract: "strict" | "compatible"` option: it defaults to `"strict"` only for
  a browser client without an `apiKey`, and otherwise no longer throws
  `OpenGeniApiContractMismatchError` from `getClientConfig()` or responses when
  the API advertises a newer revision.
- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- 3f9c757: A non-UUID resource id in the URL path (for example a newer SDK calling
  `GET .../scheduled-tasks/attention` against a server without that route, which
  falls through to `.../scheduled-tasks/:taskId`) now answers 404
  `invalid_path_identifier` instead of an unhandled 500. Malformed UUIDs that do
  not come from the request path stay server errors.
- 6f28afd: A definitively lost managed Modal sandbox no longer dead-ends its sessions. Shared sandbox groups (a parent with its children) now get the automatic checkpoint fallback, and every member receives the durable filesystem-discontinuity warning. When no checkpoint can be restored automatically (no archive, an unverified or legacy archive, an invalid artifact, or a definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure of the selected checkpoint), the whole quiescent group continues on a new empty workspace after a separate audited decision that warns every member the previous files are not available. Loss must be proven by a loss transition (a failed replacement box never counts), the empty workspace waits until the lost box is past its hard provider lifetime, other restore failures (including a missing archive object, now `archive_object_missing`, or unconfigured archive storage, now `archive_storage_unavailable`) retry the checkpoint with backoff and then wait for an operator, and a complete archive is never bypassed. Ambiguous provider states and live writers in any member still block, unknown command outcomes are never replayed, and the lost archive evidence is kept. Sessions stuck before this release recover on their next turn or Retry. The recovery projection adds `automaticLane` (`checkpoint` or `fresh_workspace`) and, for a timed wait, `availableAt` (when a Retry or a new message can decide again), and the failed-session banner says what Retry will do and when. Rolling migration 0548 requires warning protocol v3 to claim a session with an empty-workspace receipt.
- 32598eb: Expose content-free MCP phase timings and host-owned outbound trace correlation across gateway, credential, transport and persistence boundaries. Preserve W3C sampling flags, credential header semantics, exact execution authority and existing retry behavior.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 3f9c757: `deleteOrganizationWorkspace` (`DELETE /v1/organizations/:organizationId/workspaces/:workspaceId`)
  now accepts an organization API key with `workspace:admin`, so an integrating
  backend can delete the organization workspaces it provisions with
  `ensureWorkspace`. It previously answered 401 "managed human session required"
  to every key. Personal workspaces stay undeletable by keys, a read key gets 403,
  and the existing quiescence rules still apply.
- 3f9c757: Another member's private session is now indistinguishable from a missing one
  on every session route. Request-facing session authorization refuses a target
  the caller cannot see (including one that does not exist) as `404` before the
  route runs, instead of letting routes such as `GET .../queue`,
  `GET|PUT .../composer-draft`, `POST .../events` and `POST .../control` fail
  with a retryable `500` on the absent row. A missing session is now refused
  before request-body validation.
- 126a395: Make agent effort proportional to the request. The operational contract now asks for a direct answer with minimal tool use on simple asks, reuse of the earlier approach on repeat asks, one-sentence progress updates without a forced opening update, answer-first final responses, answers from web or published sources that are short but not partial (the best-supported finding, figures in the user's terms, and a source link beside each study or figure), and reading each Skill once without announcing it. A question asked mid-run gets an answer instead of restarting work; while work is still in flight the agent answers in one or two sentences in the user's terms, naming a blocker only when the user must act on it, and registers the wait again with the earlier reason and remaining time, even with an active goal, so its result still resumes the agent without pushing back a timed recheck, and a question alone no longer resumes a paused goal. Answers stay in chat by default; a document Artifact is created only when the user asks for one or the deliverable is large or meant to be kept or shared, and a session no longer creates a goal only to declare a document. The default persona is a general assistant; it works on a branch with a pull request only when the repository has a remote and git provider credentials, and otherwise leaves changes in the working tree without branch or pull request talk unless the user asks, saying only that the changes are not pushed when the repository has a remote, and the Sites and visualize Skill descriptors apply when the user asks or clearly benefits.
- 7a08660: Make a finished child's result carry its answer. An idle `child_terminal_result` now includes optional `payload.finalAnswer`: the child's newest result-bearing answer, frozen by the idle settlement, bounded to 8 KiB UTF-8 with a head/tail truncation marker and a `session_events` pointer to the full text (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswer`, `CHILD_TERMINAL_RESULT_FINAL_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES`). No answer is copied when the child's newest turn failed, was cancelled or superseded, or stopped at a segment limit. A turn claimed only to continue the child's goal (for example one that confirms and completes the goal after the answer) no longer replaces the answer: the answer is reported with that turn's output after it as `finalAnswer.goalContinuations`, whole when the parts fit the bound (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswerWithGoalContinuations`). Parts that do not fit are reported as the newest part, marked truncated, with `omittedSequences` and a `nextAction` that reads every part, so a child working across goal continuations still reports its final report. The walk stops at a non-answer outcome and at the child's newest goal activation, and a window holding only continuations reports the newest answer alone. The worker's enrichment upsert now keeps the committed answer and evidence instead of replacing them, and an untruncated answer serves as the parent claim's consumption evidence. When a parent's exact live attempt reads a direct child's complete answer through `session_wait` or `session_events` in its own model call (the worker now marks first-party calls with `_meta.opengeniCaller`, `FIRST_PARTY_MCP_CALLER_META_KEY`; Codemode calls do not count), the answer is recorded on the reading turn (`metadata.consumedChildAnswers`, `recordConsumedChildAnswers`) and `session_wait` stops counting that child's result as own pending input (`listOutstandingSessionSystemUpdatesForAttempt`). The attempt's successful completion settlement supersedes each still-pending idle result whose every part it received (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and a result the child commits after that completion is inserted already consumed, without a wake. A read by an attempt that fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing. The operational contract and the `session_create`, `session_wait`, `session_get`, `session_send_message`, and `wait_for_input` descriptions now price a child, prefer a direct answer or reusing an existing child, and steer multi-minute waits to `wait_for_input` instead of alternating `session_wait` and `session_get`. No tool is capped or removed.
- 11151c6: Support a lossless scheduled-task model and reasoning patch through MCP, HTTP and the SDK. Preserve unrelated stored configuration and existing-session settings, keep normal authority validation, and reject concurrent execution-config changes instead of overwriting them.
- 1ffeb7c: The session terminal, Files, Git and desktop viewer open again for sessions whose Sandbox Environment has default Variable Sets the session did not select itself. A Variable Set the session can no longer use now answers 403 with its id instead of a bare 500, and the API logs the cause.
- 769300e: Slack task delivery now converts model-authored Markdown to Slack mrkdwn at the Slack sink. Progress posts, the recorded `reply`, final results, the terminal update of a coalesced progress post, and approved shared-result publications turn headings into bold lines, `**bold**` into `*bold*`, `[label](https://...)` into `<https://...|label>`, and bullets into `•`, while fenced code blocks and inline code stay byte for byte. Provider citation handles (U+E200 `cite` tokens) are removed before posting. Stored session events and history keep the exact text. An operation that an earlier release already bound to the unformatted bytes keeps them: the post and update ledgers report the digest conflict before any Slack write, and delivery retries once with the unformatted bytes under the same operation id.
- bcd9988: Give the model the current time without a tool call, and ask supported models for shorter answers. Each claimed user message now carries a separate `[Message sent <weekday> <date> <HH:MM> UTC]` part taken from the turn's durable acceptance time, and each delivered machine-input batch states its `deliveredAt` and every member's `createdAt` (scheduled occurrences add `Delivered:` and `Created:` lines). The times are persisted with the history row, never computed at inference time, and never enter `Agent.instructions`. Agent turns on the Codex subscription, direct OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses routes send `text.verbosity: "low"` for GPT-5-family and later models; the new optional `textVerbosity` agent option is omitted everywhere else, so Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, chat and other compatible routes are unchanged. `reasoning.summary` is unchanged. Realtime voice-call history now keeps a user message's separate parts on separate lines.
- b5a77df: Make rejected tool arguments actionable. When a call does not match the tool's advertised input schema, the gateway error now names each missing, mistyped, or unexpected property (for example `missing required property "context"`), reports up to eight problems plus a count of the rest, and never quotes argument values. `ToolGatewayInputValidationError` gains `issues`, `omittedIssueCount`, and `summary`. The accept/reject decision still stops at the first error; the all-errors pass runs only after a rejection, only for arguments up to 64 KiB serialized, and never runs a `pattern` on a string longer than that subschema's `maxLength`.

  A model MCP call rejected this way now reads "The tool was not called because its arguments do not match the tool's input schema: ... Correct the named properties and call the tool again." instead of "Please try again", so the model fixes the arguments rather than resending the same call. Other thrown MCP failures keep the existing wording. The workspace tool HTTP call and approval routes return the same summary on their `422` (`code: "validation_failed"`, `details.code: "invalid_tool_arguments"` with `issues` and `omittedIssueCount`); the previous body carried only the bare code as its message.

- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

- c823664: New scheduled tasks and new web sessions now pick up the workspace default Sandbox Environment and the default Variable Sets it carries. A scheduled task that omits `rigId` stores the workspace default at creation, the way session create resolves it (an existing-session task keeps its target session's environment, a Connected Machine task stores none, and `null` still opts out); a later change to the workspace default does not move an existing task. Binding an environment to a task's generated sessions, whether by default, by an explicit `rigId` on create or edit, or by switching an existing-session task to generated sessions, now requires permission to attach that environment's default Variable Sets, as session create already did. In a workspace with a default, a Sandbox Environment picked in the composer applies to that session only and is no longer carried into the next new-session form, so later sessions return to the workspace default.

### Minor Changes

- 585f2c1: Add an operator-disabled ephemeral Chromium BrowserSession mode for disposable sandbox verification. Explicit requests use isolated browser contexts within a trusted actor and placement partition, preserve existing private-profile defaults, and become terminal after shared process loss instead of silently recreating or replaying work.

### Patch Changes

- e18f72b: Allow explicitly selected headless Lightpanda BrowserSessions on Connected Machines with a provisioned, digest-verified native executable. Preserve Chromium as the default and reject engine substitution on attached or external placements.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- f48191e: Key managed sign-in, sign-up, verification, and password-reset rate limits, the address recorded on auth sessions, and every other API abuse quota on one trusted request source address, with IPv6 clients keyed on their /64. Managed auth adds explicit per-client-address limits and two-tier per-email throttles (per email and address, then per email), the browser session-set sign-in returns `Retry-After` on a per-email refusal, and the managed-auth database pool keeps serving when the server closes its connections instead of crashing the API.

  Breaking: `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (optionally narrowed by `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`) replaces `OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` and `Settings.mcpOauthTrustedProxyHops` is now `Settings.apiTrustedProxyHops`. API startup and runtime-artifact generation fail while the old variable is set to anything but `0`; rename it. Managed deployments behind a proxy must now set `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`: Better Auth previously read a single-value `X-Forwarded-For` by default and now ignores forwarding headers unless the hop count is declared, so without it every user shares the proxy's address and its sign-in and sign-up limits.

### Minor Changes

- b6d65a1: Add `OPENGENI_API_METRICS_PORT`. When it is set, the API serves `GET /metrics` only on that dedicated internal listener and never on the public API port, so an ingress that forwards every path to the API cannot publish Prometheus metrics. The listener applies the same deployment-key rules as before. Leaving it unset keeps the existing single-port behavior. The Helm chart now sets it by default (`api.metricsPort: 9464`). Upgrade note: on a cluster that enforces NetworkPolicy, only the bundled collector and `networkPolicy.monitoring` reach that port, so set `networkPolicy.monitoring` for any other Prometheus that scrapes the API. Managed-auth email verification now signs the user in on the first successful link click in the default `legacy` session-set mode, and every verification email tells a recipient who did not sign up to ignore it.
- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.
- d582db0: Guard the unauthenticated local development API against browser attacks. In `local` access mode with `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT=local`, the API now answers only requests whose `Host` names this computer, which blocks DNS rebinding: loopback and the hosts of `OPENGENI_WEB_BASE_URL`, `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENGENI_GITHUB_APP_MANIFEST_BASE_URL`, and the new `OPENGENI_LOCAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for browsers, plus sandbox-only names (`host.docker.internal` with the Docker sandbox, and the hosts of `OPENGENI_MCP_URL` and `OPENGENI_MCP_INTERNAL_URL`) that serve only the Codemode, first-party MCP, and Git broker routes and refuse browser requests. Refused requests are logged once per distinct `Host` or `Origin`. Browser requests are accepted only from the configured web origin, the API's own address, or an exact origin listed in `OPENGENI_LOCAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; any other `Origin` gets 403, and local mode no longer answers with wildcard CORS. Requests without an `Origin` (the SDK, servers, sandbox callbacks) are unaffected. Managed and configured access modes, and local access mode under any other `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT`, are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 9cd1d23: Integration OAuth callbacks now land on a real page when they fail. A callback whose correctly signed state is only too old returns to that workspace's Plugins page with `reason=state_expired`; a tampered or foreign state returns to `/integrations` with `reason=state_invalid`, which the web app forwards to the current workspace. Atlassian, Google Drive, and Fiken now report those reasons (and `state_replayed` for a reused link) instead of `http_400`, `invalid_state`, `state_reused`, or `callback_failed`. Clicking Cancel at the provider reports `reason=access_denied` instead of an expired attempt. MCP, Integration Definition, social, Fiken, and personal GitHub OAuth starts default their return path to `/workspaces/:id/plugins`; Atlassian, Google Drive, and the Slack bot install keep their validated `/workspaces/:id/capabilities` path, which the web app's legacy redirect now forwards with the callback outcome. GitHub App browser routes (connect, setup, install and OAuth callbacks, installation select and configure, manifest callback) render a readable page with a way back instead of a JSON error body, including an organization policy denial and unexpected failures, keeping the status the API error handler gives. `@opengeni/github` adds `inspectSignedState`, which verifies a signed state without its age limit for explaining failures only.
- 6fd328b: Restore a browser session when ending fails before controller dispatch.
- 9b9c6df: Mark a BrowserSession lost when its controller definitively reports that the browser no longer exists during suspension.
- fa12bd4: Keep detached NATS subscription loops from rejecting the process: a poison message or throwing consumer is dropped and logged, and a subscription error such as a permissions violation ends only that subscription instead of reaching the API's fatal unhandled-rejection boundary. A session or workspace-control SSE stream whose live subscription ends fails retryably so the client replays from Postgres, and the auth-callout, Codemode request, and agent-event responders resubscribe with bounded backoff; every unexpected end is counted in `opengeni_nats_subscription_terminations_total` and alerts. Long-lived NATS connections keep reconnecting through repeated auth errors. A freshly created sandbox that misses its command-readiness budget is terminated and replaced at most once per turn attempt after a jittered pause, with outcomes in `opengeni_sandbox_readiness_replacements_total`, and Codex/xAI capacity-wait wakes are spread by a bounded replay-safe jitter so a capacity reset no longer resumes every waiting turn at once.
- bd365b7: Add a public, content-free `POST /v1/client-errors` beacon that counts web
  client failures in `opengeni_client_errors_total{kind}` with per-kind admission
  bounds, a streamed 512-byte body limit and a same-deployment `Origin` check, and
  admit its grammar-validated route pattern and bundle revision in public
  structured logs. The shared wire grammar is exported from
  `@opengeni/contracts/client-error-report`.

### Minor Changes

- 86c710a: Expose a first-party Connected Machine enrollment-token tool with existing enrollment-management authority, short-lived tokens and deployment-bound installer commands. Include agent guidance without introducing an additional approval flow.

### Patch Changes

- f60ca2b: Raise Skill folder limits eightfold to 1,024 files, 2 MiB per file, and 8 MiB total, while retaining bounded reads and existing validation.
- 38b9857: Track child unread attention from meaningful content rather than housekeeping, and acknowledge complete parent-consumed results for the exact initiating human. Preserve newer unseen work and manual attention intent, decode retained evidence losslessly, and reconcile proven historical consumption conservatively. Requires maintenance migration 0503 before starting the matching attention-aware writers.
- 90e089a: Add a rollout-gated short MCP OAuth state that stores encrypted, time-limited callback context in Postgres. Preserve legacy in-flight callbacks and one-use replay protection.
- 58eb331: Trust successful immutable Site upload writes instead of requiring immediate read-after-write visibility. Observe conditional-write winners and editable source with the existing bounded missing-object retry policy, preserve provider errors, and never replay writes during read recovery.
- 59682ac: Fix Slack workspace picker cards rejected with invalid_blocks by separating repeated action IDs into distinct provider blocks. Preserve existing operation receipts and click handles for safe retries and apply the same serialization to message updates.
- b1ad0c6: Start Slack tasks with the initiating user's saved website repositories, variable sets, compute and tool selections in the destination workspace. Preserve draft content, explicit empty tools, and ordinary resource authorization.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

### Minor Changes

- 1c924ed: Add authorized, resumable literal search of saved user and completed assistant
  messages, including unloaded history. Workspace search can return one
  representative match per session; in-session Find returns every occurrence with
  stable event identity and original-text UTF-16 offsets. Requests and browser
  result batches remain bounded, with explicit continuation and provisional counts.

  Expose bounded exact-sequence history navigation and message highlighting for
  React hosts. The web console connects a contextual session-search dialog to
  full-history Find, preserves search state across navigation, and keeps ended
  conversations readable. Tool output, reasoning and unfinished delta-only
  assistant messages are outside the initial searchable scope. Exact Markdown
  matches use a labeled source excerpt that stays in place when Find closes;
  readers can explicitly restore the formatted message.

- 132b945: Add organization-owned integration acquisition policy with a discoverable catalog,
  revisioned administration API and SDK, and organization settings. Enforce selected
  provider and custom-protocol permissions on supported setup and installation paths
  at preparation and persistence boundaries.

  Preserve ordinary ownership and authorization, exact completed-request replay,
  unchanged reconciliation, cancellation and other reducing operations. Existing
  connection execution and credential refresh are not revoked by this policy.
  Deployment-configured tools and embedding-host session-local MCP configuration
  retain their existing admission rules; this is not a network or execution allowlist.

  Apply the organization integration policy migration and matching role provisioning
  with the matching runtime before enabling the setting. Older runtimes do not enforce
  the new acquisition policy. See `docs/organization-integration-policy.md` for the
  administration, identity, persistence and recovery contract.

### Patch Changes

- a6d3e4a: Route persistent behavior to scoped workspace instructions or applicable Skills
  instead of retrieval-only Knowledge. Make the routing and safe instruction-edit
  guidance unconditional, reinforce it in save tools and Skill guidance, and retain
  the existing scope and Agent learning controls.
- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.
- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- 9de8e51: Route missing integration setup through provider-neutral catalog discovery and the shared human authorization card, with an explicit next action for every eligible catalog integration. Continue account selection and installation through owner authorization without an extra launch click, and open repository configuration in a separate tab.
- c702159: Stop retrying permanent runtime database posture and configuration failures as
  connection errors. Validate local startup prerequisites, prevent overlapping
  launchers from rotating live database credentials, and check database posture
  before building the development sandbox.
- c45ce34: Return MCP OAuth clients through 200 HTML after consent, and keep the clicked Authorize or Deny decision when the form disables its buttons.
- 3977932: Polish MCP OAuth consent for every client: shared OpenGeni chrome, organization and workspace pickers at authorize time, tokens that follow the chosen workspace, and token exchange that accepts any registered redirect URI.
- 855f1dd: Use webview-safe OAuth consent CSS and return clients to the app automatically after approve, without a second Continue click.
- c8bb974: Accept native MCP OAuth clients during dynamic registration: ignore extra RFC 7591 metadata, allow custom-scheme redirect URIs, and return a continue page after consent instead of a raw redirect that embedded browsers drop.
- 9d9b94b: Keep the published dependency closure aligned with the updated plugin removal
  contracts. The SDK exposes named removal outcomes and optional preview-token
  confirmation alongside the existing installation-version check.
- a6251eb: Add isolated async trace context, parent/link export, bounded trace batching and
  retry health, and opt-in protected failure diagnostics independent of the
  application database. Preserve the public telemetry privacy projection.
- d3672c0: Measure workspace capture gate waits on every routed sandbox operation, including
  mid-turn and API-direct operations, without changing provider-call accounting or
  admission guarantees. Record physical warm capture and publication duration at
  actual settlement, including captures that outlive the initiating caller.
- 6ed7dfb: Give session-message search a dedicated bounded HTTP metric label so its request latency and failures can be distinguished from unknown routes without recording search text or workspace IDs.

  The stock web app debounces committed search queries, keeps partial results on transient failures, and resumes failed scans from their last successful continuation instead of discarding progress. Authorization failures still clear retained content.

  Reduce long-message search database work by reusing the already-authorized event identity and scoped transaction, and coalescing adjacent scalar windows within the existing per-request budget. Literal Unicode matching, lossless offsets, live visibility checks, and ordinary conversation slice bounds are preserved.

- f7c9169: Support verified-email Google and GitHub sign-in linking and personal sign-in
  method management. Preserve canonical user ownership and email-verification
  checks, require recent authentication for sensitive changes, prevent removal of
  the last usable method, and respect explicit provider disconnection until a
  verified reconnect. Surface actionable callback feedback and security
  notification outcomes without granting integration access.
- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.

### Patch Changes

- 084e56b: Apply the curated source size limit consistently when parsing Microsoft's Graph definition while preserving the smaller limit for custom sources. Keep OneDrive file and sharing operations within the tool limit by excluding the nested Excel workbook API.
- de5569f: Allow native full organization API keys to administer host MCP resolver registrations. Align request authorization, live-key revalidation, and the database write trigger with the public key contract without granting human organization-admin permissions. Read-only, workspace-scoped, delegated, external-user, expired, and revoked credentials remain denied.
- 7746251: Prevent agent-authored workspace instruction changes from replacing the complete active policy, fence unsafe older pending revisions at approval, and show reviewers the current and proposed instruction text before approval.
- 37f16c2: Keep curated Microsoft Graph integrations within storage and MCP schema limits by explicitly exposing provider-validated JSON bodies instead of expanding the recursive entity graph. Preserve request parameters, body requirements, media types, authorization and write approvals. Reject oversized compiled revisions during preview before installation begins.

  Request People.Read for the signed-in user's people suggestions. Keep OneDrive to file scopes and omit the organization-only followed-sites surface, allowing personal Microsoft accounts to complete consent.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Patch Changes

- 50ac837: Add explicit accepted-turn host binding selection for shared conversations. Capture each participant's exact owner delegation without changing the configured destination or borrowing creator credentials, preserve fixed bindings and scheduled/child live authority checks, and apply session-local server configuration to follow-up selection. Document the supported empty-session then first-text admission flow.
- 71fd840: Accept Microsoft's token responses that omit offline_access from access-token scopes. Require a refresh token as proof of offline access, preserve that capability after refresh, and continue rejecting missing resource permissions.
- 123cf57: Make agent-authored workspace instruction changes non-destructive: append new rules by default, require one exact anchor for edits or removals, and reserve complete replacement for an explicit mode while preserving baseline conflict checks and instruction budgets.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 935af4e: Add an authorized standalone session inline MCP credential rotation operation with durable idempotent receipts, exact destination and credential-version fencing, and atomic quiescence checks. Expose the operation through HTTP and the SDK without sending messages, scheduling work, retrying external mutations, or widening connection or attempt authority. Keep existing message-bound credential updates unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 8a60104: Record Gmail startup authorization failures in diagnostics and let agents request in-conversation consent for enabled personal integrations whose tools are unavailable. Personal access continues to require the owner's explicit session grant.
- d08dbb6: Support capability-gated transactional large-file edits on Connected Machines,
  with bounded transfers, verified outcomes, and live authorization checks. Keep
  legacy agent writes compatible and report oversized outbound requests accurately
  instead of marking a healthy agent offline. Native agent support is required;
  unsupported filesystem semantics fail closed.

## 2.12.4

### Patch Changes

- e1a50ba: Spool Linux host-backed workspace archives through capture, object storage, and cold restore instead of materializing whole JSON/base64 payloads. Isolate each upload at a fresh physical locator and verify stored bytes without assuming conditional-PUT support. Preserve legacy locators, archive format, configured restore limits, and lease capture/publication authority; retain candidates after ambiguous publication outcomes.

## 2.12.3

### Patch Changes

- a9cc903: Allow workspace artifact mutations from service turns that retain an immutable causal human only while the exact live attempt, selected artifact tool, publish permission, and interruption fences all hold. Document that the causal-human field is never standalone authorization, and continue to reject pure service work and stale attempts.

### Patch Changes

  - @opengeni/runtime@2.5.1
  - @opengeni/core@2.9.1

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Use authenticated canonical users instead of session end-user labels. Session
  creation rejects caller-supplied identity scope; list filters use scopeSubjectId.
  Chat user mode uses asUser and explicit workspace membership, while collaborators
  address the same session ID. Reopen legacy user-namespaced chats by session ID.

  Retire active session Memory in favor of task notes. Historical session Memory
  remains stored and old selectors hydrate as off, never workspace. User Memory
  uses the verified active-turn user. Preserve frozen scheduled agent-reach policy.
  Migration 0457 requires the documented maintenance cutover and matching writers.

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

  larger than a page or loaded-window byte target are delivered intact on their own.

## 2.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 29551cb: Clarify that ancestor Pause interrupts the calling agent and that accepted coordination messages require identity-correlated delivery and result verification. Preserve existing recursive controls and discourage duplicate unconsumed messages.
- 14dd6fe: Add workspace transcription provider preferences and optional fallback after explicit rejection, preserving recording pins after uncertain or successful attempts. Refresh expired SuperGrok credentials and recover the provider's invalid-credential 403 response.
- f04243d: Preserve durable wake acknowledgment receipts through API and worker signalers. Report pending admission and unconfirmed legacy signal delivery separately from acknowledged revisions, so transport acceptance cannot be mistaken for agent execution progress. Existing wake retries and admission fences remain authoritative.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 4536385: Expose independently configurable GitHub action approval policies for routine writes, review submission, and pull-request merges, while preserving capability-first defaults, explicit policies, and attempt-frozen execution authority.
- fa12951: Separate command interaction from session history. Add bounded retained-output command reads and use the same operation for command waits. Terminal reads observe completion and suppress only still-pending completion notifications; running reads, claimed notifications, and historical tool results remain unchanged.

  Make session history conversation-first with complete-message pagination and explicit results, tools, and debug views. Preserve cursor detail selection, provide oversized-message continuation, and keep queued prompts distinct from processed conversation. Update concise model guidance for the new surfaces.

  `command_wait` now uses `waitSeconds`, an output cursor, and the same flat result as `command_read`; clients using the previous command wrapper must update. Apply the additive command-observation migration before starting the new readers.

- d9dbd5d: Add authenticated general feedback and session/turn ratings with exact comments,
  author attribution, idempotent submission, and private-session isolation.
- 0c39126: Add per-connection turn-model permissions and organization workspace assignment
  for subscriptions and model gateways. Migration 0424 requires draining APIs and
  workers; do not restart older workers after policies are enabled.

  Fix organization Codex sign-in in local mode without granting managed-human reset-credit ownership to the local administrator.

- 575af5b: Expose workspace project management through MCP, including shared pins/order, session filing, project-filtered discovery and project selection at session creation. Bundle concise, on-demand project organization guidance for every agent, independent of compute backend and retain existing session authorization checks.
- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- 0a81cc8: Add durable workspace pause/resume timers with duration controls, countdowns,
  manual cancellation, and idempotent worker execution. Migration 0420 requires a
  maintenance deployment: drain old writers and deploy matching API/workers.

### Patch Changes

- a7f101f: Restore API-direct sandboxes from workspace archives stored behind durable object-storage references. Reject malformed archive locators before creating a replacement workspace.
- 22a6704: Correct oversized session-message continuation with bounded source slicing, preserve typed runner terminal failures during command observation, and keep retained command output readable when live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure. Refresh fallback rechecks API authorization and explicitly marks unavailable freshness; it does not mask integrity or authorization errors.
- 7dac7e3: Decode bounded session-monitoring progress scalars with their persisted lossless codec version. Preserve canonical prefixes and explicit truncation without reporting encoded storage lengths as original character counts. Clarify that completion joins use the last consumed event cursor, not a session snapshot watermark that may already include an unread child result.

  Validate the complete stored progress scalar before decoding its bounded prefix, preserving literal malformed codec markers even when an invalid suffix lies beyond the read boundary.

- 582dc62: Inherit only repository resources when spawning child sessions. File attachments now require explicit selection; document this in the session creation tool.
- 694c1ff: Add GPT-6 Astra to the static Codex subscription catalog using the current Codex client version and the existing 272k context policy.
- c1dc59b: Default sessions_list and session_get MCP results to compact actionable discovery and child-management state. Retain the legacy bounded projections through detail: full, including effectiveToolPolicy for configuration inspection. Make related-work evidence opt-in for plain compact browse while automatically retaining search evidence and its advisory-only authority facts. Preserve exact cursors, goal completion evidence, pause reasons, and REST/UI defaults; keep target-only ancestor control redacted in both detail modes.
- cc1bfe0: Keep filtered session rows consistent with their selection, track concurrent folder detachment in activity revisions, bound sparse creator lookups, and reject timestamp precision that cannot be preserved.
- d8a70ec: Enforce the first-party MCP tool ceiling on current-human gateway and OAuth consent surfaces, propagate MCP OAuth deployment settings, and hide the undeliverable Sites Skill on Connected Machines.
- 1c4b707: Expose goal_resume so agents can resume any paused goal without a pause-reason restriction; include it for existing sessions with goal_pause.
- cc1bfe0: Add cursor-bound project, creator, and date filters to session pages so grouped sidebars can load older sessions independently within the group being viewed.
- 7772511: Let verified Personal workspace owners manage preferences, model configuration,
  runtime controls, and instruction/Skill autonomy without granting membership or
  API-key delegation powers.
- 64c7c5c: Allow Personal workspaces to inherit their organization's Codex subscription pool and select an explicit source while retaining organization-only credential management. Keep Personal session creation available when optional Only-me session tenancy is unavailable.

  Activate inheritance through maintenance migration 0422 after draining old API and worker processes. Include Personal workspaces in organization Codex source-change protection and capacity wakeups.

- 1f33e54: Report upstream OAuth metadata HTTP denials with a safe stage and status instead of a generic discovery validation error.
- cda46e8: Resolve session schedule indicators from current indexed schedule targets, including paused schedules. Add a session-filtered schedules list so existing chats link to all schedules targeting them without reading workspace schedules in the browser.
- a37a4e6: Allow session_get to omit sessionId only for the authenticated current agent session, preserving live-attempt and target authorization. Sessionless callers still require an explicit ID; compact and full results remain bounded.
- e80f52c: Keep Slack delivery open across empty-result waits and pacing yields instead of announcing premature task completion and losing the later result.

  Notify Slack requesters when billing or usage limits stop execution instead of silently waiting for a result that requires an owner to resolve the limit.

- deb9578: Search every descendant depth when agent topology is scoped to an explicit root session. Explicit parent filters still narrow the query to that parent, and cursor validation preserves the original scope.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f81b57: Add authenticated, bounded GitHub branch suggestions for exact workspace App
  repositories and exact selected personal OAuth repositories, including focused
  contract and SDK subpaths. Recheck repository authority around provider
  requests, keep provider credentials server-side, and preserve arbitrary refs at
  the session resource boundary. Add lazy branch pickers, verified public GitHub
  URL attachment with immutable commit fencing, explicit anonymous-clone warnings
  for other HTTPS hosts, render-safe manual drafts, idempotent unlink
  reconciliation, and debounced live repository refreshes across new and existing
  sessions.

### Patch Changes

- e0ecc8a: Keep account-scoped external workspace provisioning out of workspace UUID actor middleware so organization API keys can idempotently provision tenant workspaces.
- 7266b42: Return existing OpenGeni users directly to the exact pending organization invitation after an invited-email-bound sign-in, explain wrong-account states with an account-switch action, and preserve the global invitation list as an email-independent fallback.
- c0e06c3: Keep the GitHub installation account chooser available when a workspace owner
  has exactly one existing installation, so they can install the App on another
  personal account or organization instead of being forced into the existing one.
- 9af1666: Keep backward session-history pagination advancing across oversized legacy events by applying the canonical bounded read projection instead of failing the page, and report when a forensic response is no longer byte-for-byte exact.

### Patch Changes

- 26006f3: Bound Connected Machine event backlogs per exact runner. Separate connections now ingest with bounded concurrency, while consecutive queued heartbeats collapse to the newest sample without reordering lifecycle events.
- 7e67729: Prevent parent agents from duplicating delegated work. Child creation now requires an independent integration plan, and `session_wait` can ignore messages, goal/progress events, maintenance turns, and continuation segments until a child produces a result-bearing final turn or blocks.
- 478f572: Harden organization API keys with explicit credential provenance, fail-closed revocation of ambiguous legacy account keys, bounded delegation, atomic organization-key and workspace limits, and safer rotation and one-time-secret UI behavior.

### Patch Changes

- b471a90: Add an organization-owner Off, Review first, or Autonomous policy for agent-managed organization identity, including owner-only API and SDK controls, exact-attempt automatic activation, immutable receipts, and the organization settings control.
- 96624a7: Move agent computer interaction to managed ComputerSession tools. The legacy runtime desktop API remains exported only as a deprecated, fail-closed migration shell; because direct sandbox desktop control and model-bound tools are no longer functional, release `@opengeni/runtime` as the next major. Managed observations now carry bounded native image content for visual model input while preserving viewer control, explicit manual/on-verify recording, and historical contract parsing.
- 4bacdd3: Add fixed-scope organization API keys, idempotent external tenant workspace provisioning, Personal-workspace exclusion, and the matching SDK and integration guidance.
- 72de39c: Retain low-cardinality workspace deletion phase, inventory, and total transaction metrics with exact workspace identifiers confined to structured logs.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 699477a: Restore autonomous agent Workspace Memory writes whenever workspace Memory is enabled. Agents can save and correct active facts, decisions, incidents, fixes, and outcomes independently of Learning mode while all existing Memory kinds remain retrieval-only through search. Autonomous learning may activate eligible concise Workspace instructions and focused Skills through their governed, auditable, undoable lifecycles; Review first keeps proposals inactive and Off creates no derived change.
- ddce5cc: Allow scheduled generated sessions and nested workers to target an exact Connected Machine, and fail closed without leaving an unstarted generated session behind when that route cannot be established.
- 132c8d3: Require self-hosted-only session defaults to resolve to a reachable Connected Machine. Keep the composer blocked when no eligible machine exists instead of submitting an unroutable session.

- 9787ca2: Close authorization-revoked SSE responses cleanly and cycle browser streams with server- and browser-owned HTTP/1 lifetimes so stale or orphaned native requests cannot exhaust the shared connection pool or starve ordinary API reads.
- 34a05ca: Deliver browser HTTP/1 events as immediate, vendor-typed snapshots read from the durable event store, without opening a timed live subscription or closing the reusable socket. Preserve cursor-based replay while preventing replaced documents from starving ordinary API reads across tabs and account changes.

### Patch Changes

- 09beefa: Attribute fatal API startup and runtime failures with secret-safe structural diagnostics, drain pending OTLP exports for a bounded interval, and preserve the required nonzero process exit.
- 92f227f: Make session and workspace Pause/Resume desired-state mutations report authoritative changed, unchanged, and replayed outcomes. Represented no-ops no longer allocate control revisions, events, interruptions, or wakes, while newer descendant overrides and missing lifecycle repairs still produce real mutations. First-party MCP session control now returns the same versioned mutation receipt for agent-bound and sessionless callers.

- 6e12f3a: Add canonical-human organization recovery custody with exactly three accepted custodians, two-person approval, a fixed seven-day cooldown, promotion-only co-owner execution, durable notification evidence, and immutable workspace organization ownership.

### Patch Changes

- a7912ea: Add a one-click, owner-authorized OpenGeni Lens GitHub App installation flow for the PR Review Pack, backed by durable single-use OAuth authority, shared signed-webhook routing, and exact-repository least-privilege installation tokens. Keep bring-your-own GitHub App, GitLab, and Azure DevOps registration as the provider-neutral advanced path.
- d7ab403: Bundle Workspace Insights usage and model projections into bounded analytical reads while preserving filter, visibility, and UTC boundary semantics.
- 9ef491b: Add the Agent Knowledge product surface, Personal workspace knowledge views and defaults, workspace learning-autonomy administration, explicit routing guidance between Memory, Skills, and Workspace instructions, authority-first organization Document search, exact replay-safe confirmed Memory materialization, and the narrower organization identity/mission boundary with richer facts retrieved from organization knowledge.
- 5d4edd4: Add a public atomic composer application command shared by HTTP and in-process hosts, including atomic host-authorized resource augmentation without a trusted draft rewrite; add a receiver-safe narrow React session client constructor with host submit overrides and draft projection; and add presentation-only file-node filtering across the packaged workbench surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.
- b5071cf: Require every Rig to layer setup and checks on the deployment-managed platform sandbox, reject new explicit Rig image overrides, keep provider-native image ids out of durable lease identity, and verify Browser, Terminal, and Computer services before publishing a Rig provider image.

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8fabf12: Document the one-way deployment boundary for named signup and invited-user
  setup. Migration 0348 requires every API, control worker, and turn worker to be
  stopped and drained before it runs, with the exact old/new application database
  roles supplied to the migration runner. Start only binaries built for schema
  ordinal 0348 or newer after it commits; never restart a pre-0348 image, and
  remain in maintenance to fix forward if the new runtime cannot start.
- 8fabf12: Repair realtime human-authority routing and metrics, personal Document reads
  under FORCE RLS, private-session visibility transition checks, and
  tenant-scoped session-tenancy fencing through migrations 0343-0345.

  Migration 0345 is a one-way maintenance cutover. Stop and drain every API,
  control worker, and turn worker before applying it, then start only binaries
  built for schema ordinal 0345 or newer. Never restart a pre-0345 image after
  the migration commits: its session-tenancy writes do not enter the required
  workspace fence and will fail closed.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 47b88d3: Add explicit managed onboarding: ordinary verified signup completes an organization-name-only setup that creates only the owner membership and canonical Personal workspace, while unregistered invitees can use a digest-only one-time account setup link before signing in normally.
- c5e4684: Expose bounded organization-admin audit APIs and SDK methods for Default-collection backfill runs, operations, workspace receipts, and organization-wide Document authority reclassifications.
- dc10a36: Let an administrator see and set which OpenGeni workspace each Slack channel starts work in, from the Slack capability sheet. A channel with no choice is not broken: it asks the first person who uses it and remembers the answer, and the sheet says so.
- dc6cfff: Turn per-channel and per-DM Slack workspace routing on by default, and stop counting a personal workspace as a routing choice in a channel.

  A personal workspace is now a candidate only in that person's own bot DM. It is the wrong destination for a channel - a shared thread routed into one member's private space is invisible to everyone else in the channel - and because managed tenancy provisions a personal workspace for every member, counting it meant nobody ever had exactly one candidate. That defeated the sole-candidate rule, so an organization with a single shared workspace would have been asked to choose in every channel despite having no choice to make.

  With that fixed, an organization with one shared workspace sees no change. For an organization with several, an unrouted channel asks the first person who uses it and remembers the answer, and a bot DM goes to that person's own personal workspace. Two things are worth knowing before upgrading: someone who has lost live organization authority in the routed workspace now receives a refusal in their bot DM where the previous code failed silently, and someone whose only workspace is their own personal one is now refused in a channel rather than having channel work land somewhere nobody else can see. Apply migrations through 0342 before running the new image. Set `OPENGENI_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ROUTING_ENABLED=false` to restore the short-circuit to the installation's own workspace.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f30555c: Add atomic same-workspace session forks with an explicit private or workspace destination. Private-to-workspace copies require a durable acknowledgement, workspace members may fork a shared source into fresh authority of their own, and private sources remain owner-only. Exact applied receipts remain recoverable by the same live workspace actor after mutable source authority changes, while changed requests conflict and fresh keys still require current source authority. Every fork receives fresh authority, provenance, root, and sandbox-group identity without inheriting live grants, credentials, Connections, turns, goals, MCP, resource attachments, processes, or pins. The managed web control now exposes the generic Fork dialog to authorized shared-session members and verifies the returned owned destination before navigation.
- b74e557: Add an explicit, replay-safe Document authority-reclassification lifecycle and
  a resumable organization Default-collection backfill. Reclassification requires
  the exact expected authority tuple, updates the Document and every chunk in one
  transaction, and retains immutable before/after receipts. The SDK and API expose
  the account-admin and actor-fenced operations, bounded cursor-paginated receipt
  history, and same-organization portable-personal behavior without making
  collections an authority boundary.
- 6fd5aee: Codex reset-credit overview responses now explain whether redemption belongs to the current managed human, an unowned legacy connection, another human, or an unavailable managed identity. Eligible admins can follow an explicit same-account reconnect path that claims only a null owner; existing ownership remains non-transferable without disconnect.
- b2cd0f0: Slack can notify the human when work they started stops making progress, **off by default and switched on per workspace**. The new `slackOrchestrationNotices` workspace setting carries one boolean per notice (`childRequiresAction`, `goalPaused`), two checkboxes sit beside the reaction shortcut in the Slack integration settings, and `resolveWorkspaceSlackOrchestrationNoticeSettings` fails closed: absent, malformed, or partially invalid settings resolve to both disabled, so only an explicit opt-in ever posts. An unsolicited Slack post is worse than a missed one, and the in-app rail and priority feed already surface this work.

  When a workspace opts in, a Slack-originated session's `child_requires_action` notice becomes one bounded pointer card ("A worker you started needs input", a single-line first-question or waiting-approval preview, and an **Open in OpenGeni** link to the child session), and a goal that pauses for `limits` or `max_auto_continuations` becomes one bounded line. Deferred child lifecycle notices, `user_pause` / `api` / `agent` / `no_progress` pauses, and `goal.resumed` stay silent, and so does a blocked-worker notice whose exact `(child, turn, generation)` boundary already carries a resolution or whose own row is `superseded` or `cancelled` - Slack delivery runs behind the session, and a card announcing a worker that is no longer blocked is worse than no card. Both notices draw on the same durable per-interaction slot budget as assistant progress, so an orchestration that fans out to many blocked children cannot turn one thread into a feed; a slot is claimed only when a card is actually going to be posted.

  A disabled notice takes the same "nothing to post for this event" path as an undeliverable one - no post, no ledger row, and the delivery cursor advances identically - and every pre-existing Slack card type is unaffected. Both reuse the durable per-event post-operation ledger, so reaper retries and replica claims cannot double-post. Rolling migration `0329_slack_orchestration_delivery_events.sql` adds `system.update.pending` and `goal.paused` to the Slack delivery claim's event types, and `@opengeni/db` exports the read-only `getSessionSystemUpdateById` and `childRequiresActionResolutionExists` used to resolve the exact typed notice and prove it is still current.

- 1789977: Ask once where an unconfigured Slack conversation should work, remember the answer, and re-queue the request that was interrupted by the question. One live card per person per conversation is enforced by a partial unique index, an aged-out card is settled by the writer rather than holding the slot, and the answer commits the choice, the remembered route and the re-queued request together.

### Patch Changes

- ff56d96: Let a Slack access-request link name the workspace a routed conversation actually works in, instead of only the installation's own. Both intent routes now assert that the installation binding resolves for the token's team, that it is the same connection the token was minted against, and that the named workspace belongs to that installation's organization.
- e720d3e: Add a quiet "-> Workspace" line to Slack acknowledgements and deliveries when routing actually chose a workspace, and bump all five Slack post operation-id seeds to v2 in the same change so no interaction with a claimed-but-unposted delivery row can wedge on a digest that will never match again.
- 92324b5: Preserve lazy tool preparation while fencing every actual local tool call on the shared attempt preparation promise. Codemode now distinguishes a catalog that is still preparing from invalid or stale attempt authority, and repeated same-turn provider or MCP recovery stops after five automatic replacements with explicit terminal exhaustion evidence.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: The first-party `opengeni` MCP server gains `session_human_input_respond` (`sessions:control`, `session.human_input.write`): a live attempt answers or skips another session's structured human-input request, recorded as `agent_attempt:<attemptId>`, and signals that session's workflow exactly like the REST route. `session_wait` reports `ownPendingImmediateUpdates` and `ownPendingDeferredUpdateKinds`; only immediate-class own input ends the wait. The API and both workers install `OPENGENI_CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_ENABLED` into `@opengeni/db` at boot. The worker delivers a child's `child_requires_action` outbox row to the parent right after the `requires_action` settlement (generalized `deliverChildLifecycleOutboxToParent`; the reaper covers crashes) and the goal-continuation prompt explains every child notice kind, offering `opengeni__session_human_input_respond` only when it is in the session's effective first-party selection.
- de3f376: Bound and shape the durable text an agent authors on a user's behalf. The budget
  follows the destination, on every agent surface that reaches it. A mandatory
  workspace rule is composed verbatim into the prompt of every session it applies
  to, so `remember`, `instruction_policy_propose`, and `task_note_promote_instruction_policy`
  are all capped at 600 characters; the preference destination is capped at 1,200
  across its three surfaces, because only its short descriptor is composed and the
  content is retrieved on demand. Task-note promotion is checked in the database
  layer, where the content is the note rather than a request field, and is rejected
  rather than truncated before any evidence, claim, or proposal row is written.
  `company_profile_propose`, the largest always-on surface, is capped for agents at
  400 characters per scalar, 200 per list entry, and 4,096 UTF-8 bytes total. The
  Knowledge lane keeps its 4,000-character retrieval-evidence ceiling, and every
  human editor limit is unchanged so nothing a person already typed becomes
  invalid. Tool descriptions now state the prompt cost and the authoring shape, and
  the `remember` confirmation card names the character count and destination so a
  human can judge the cost before saving. Existing stored revisions are never
  rewritten.
- e6ffdc7: The agent-facing `goal_set` MCP tool no longer accepts `maxAutoContinuations` (the ceiling stays on `CreateSessionRequest.goal` and scheduled tasks), and the operator PATCH resume emits `goal.resumed{reason:"api"}`. The worker passes the configured idle-backoff policy to the goal materializer and treats a `deferred` result like `held`: the workflow closes and the delayed wake-outbox row (or any new input) restarts it, with no Temporal timer.
- 0b3b8df: Add an explicit organization-owner-confirmed agent path for company-profile and
  strategic-goal administration. The two-step MCP flow stages an immutable inactive
  full-profile proposal, binds activation to the initiating human's exact
  structured confirmation, revalidates current organization authority and profile
  CAS in PostgreSQL under the canonical workspace/session lock order, and remains
  independent of workspace learning mode. The manual `account:admin` route keeps
  its admission contract, and the earlier proposal-only `company_profile_propose`
  tool (`durable_learning` provenance) is retired in favor of this path.
- bbd19e0: Add an owner/admin organization setting that enables Only-me chats in shared
  workspaces for organizations holding the session-tenancy readiness receipt
  (`GET`/`PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/private-session-settings`,
  `@opengeni/sdk/organization-private-session-settings`, and the organization
  settings page). Already activated organizations are backfilled enabled.
- 8e2361b: Slack bot message ergonomics. The acknowledgement now carries exactly one **Open in OpenGeni** link plus the **Status**/**Stop** buttons and drops the how-to prose the buttons already say; the private-handoff and human-DM variants keep their distinct privacy sentence, and the reaction-summon acknowledgement is unchanged. That prose appears once per Slack identity per installation, inside the same acknowledgement message. The decision is resolved and frozen through `resolveSlackInteractionFirstTaskHint` before the provider post, so an acknowledgement repaired after a crash, a lost response, or a replica race re-renders byte-identically for the digest-bound post ledger; a resolution failure raises into the retryable inbox path instead of binding that ledger to a hint-less message. A control click on the acknowledgement carries the hint forward, so pressing **Status** cannot destroy the only copy an identity is ever shown, while later control cards carry none.

  Completed results no longer append "Reply in this thread to continue." or **Make recurring**, which moves to the **Status** card for the requester who still holds `sessions:read` plus `scheduled_tasks:manage` (same schedules deep-link contract, now omitted rather than thrown when no absolute web base URL is configured). The configured slash command gains the single argument `info`: an ephemeral, workspace-aware Block Kit card that creates no session, never touches the durable inbox, and re-proves the exact Slack identity link plus the live workspace grant before echoing any workspace-identifying text (unlinked identities get the ordinary connect view, granted-but-revoked identities get request-access). Each of its lines is gated on the grant that authorizes it: `sessions:control` for continue/stop, `sessions:create` for starting, `scheduled_tasks:manage` for recurrence. Reply `stop`, the three-progress cap, human-input/approval cards, blocker/failure posts, requester mention rules, disabled unfurling, the post-operation ledger, and outcome-unknown reconciliation are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 1fc235b: Omit a human/API prompt whose turn was never claimed (still queued, or deleted/edited/cancelled before any claim) from `sessions_list` `includeLastMessage` previews and the MCP `session_events` monitoring read, so orchestrators do not mistake work the model never received for processed conversation. `queuedPromptCount` still reports waiting work, the exact stored row appears at its original sequence once the turn is claimed, and REST event pages, SSE, and forensic reads are unchanged. Rolling migration 0322 adds the partial index `session_turns_unclaimed_prompt_trigger_idx` (`workspace_id, session_id, trigger_event_id` where `started_at IS NULL`) that serves the unclaimed-turn probe.
- 26042f9: Prefer OAuth Dynamic Client Registration whenever an MCP authorization server advertises both DCR and Client ID Metadata Documents. This avoids provider authorization failures caused by treating the metadata-document URL as a universally accepted client ID while retaining explicit provider-profile overrides for either registration mechanism.
- 72f8fc6: The first-party `github_repositories_list` MCP tool now attaches `githubInstallationId`/`githubRepositoryId` to every allowlisted repository resource, public or private, so sessions and scheduled tasks built from it receive a scoped installation token instead of an anonymous read-only clone.
- acd38d1: Retire Browser and Desktop resources when their source task leaves the Connected Machine that owns their controller, stop retrying the terminal placement conflict, and let Desktop create one replacement on the task's current placement.

### Patch Changes

- b2dd2f7: Bound the remaining request-scoped workspace control-row mutations and make the lock budget a first-class setting: `updateWorkspaceSettings`, `deleteSessionTreeIfQuiescent`, queue move/edit/delete, composer draft save, and the MCP agent message accept an optional `controlLockTimeoutMs` that API routes and core commands pass (lifecycle callers keep the unbounded wait), so a busy workspace yields the same typed retryable 503 `WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`. `OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` is now parsed and validated once at boot by `@opengeni/config` (`workspaceControlLockTimeoutMs`, positive integer ms, default 20000), installed into `@opengeni/db` by `createApp` through `configureWorkspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs`, and rendered by the deployment runtime-env generator as an optional passthrough.
- ab81e47: Allow the managed staging Slack app and bot to use the visibly distinct `OpenGeni Staging` identity. The manifest, runtime configuration, installation verification, durable binding contract, SDK, web projection, and deployment artifacts now preserve one closed environment-qualified display-name setting while production continues to default to `OpenGeni`.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2027bc3: Stop silently creating personal Connections when the caller never asked for one.

  ## Read before upgrading

  **1. `configured` product-access-mode deployments lose personal Connections
  entirely.** If your deployment runs `OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE=configured`
  (a shared operator key rather than managed sign-in), personal Gmail, hosted
  Slack MCP, Google Drive, and Atlassian connect will stop working after this
  upgrade, and there is no workspace-owned alternative for the personal-only
  providers. The shared configured key resolves to
  `principalKind: "configured_key"`, and its subject comes from a caller-supplied
  `x-opengeni-subject` header that proves nothing — a shared operator key cannot
  supply the per-human consent a personal Connection represents. Existing personal
  Connections in such a deployment keep working until their refresh token fails
  (see below), but no new one can be created and none can be re-consented. Move to
  `managed` mode if you need personal Connections. `local` mode is unaffected: its
  bootstrap `dev` subject is a `human_session` and genuinely is the sole operator.

  **2. Breaking for direct API/SDK callers of
  `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/integrations/oauth/start`.** An omitted
  `ownership` is now a **422** when the resolved provider profile allows both
  ownerships; the caller must choose. Reconnects and single-ownership profiles
  (Gmail, hosted Slack MCP) are unaffected, as is the web app, which always sends
  an explicit value.

  **3. Machine-owned personal Connections have no re-consent path.** See
  "Existing rows" below for the remediation and a survey query to run first.

  ## What changed

  The Integration Definition OAuth start resolved an omitted `ownership` to
  `personal`, inverting the documented workspace-owned default. It no longer
  guesses. Resolving the omission to `workspace` instead was rejected
  deliberately: an executed probe confirmed it flips a newly connected Outlook
  mailbox (and Drive/OneDrive) from subject-scoped to workspace-shared, which is a
  real narrow-to-broad widening, and this change must only narrow or make
  explicit. The MCP OAuth start keeps its existing, already-correct
  `defaultOwnershipFor` behaviour.

  Personal ownership is now restricted to a managed human on every path that mints
  a new personal owner: MCP OAuth start, Integration Definition OAuth start,
  manual `POST /connections`, first-party social OAuth start, and the
  personal-only Google Drive and Atlassian install routes. An API key, the shared
  `configured:` key, a service principal, an agent attempt, a grant that fails
  `contextIntegrity`, or a principal substituting another subject now gets an
  explicit **422** instead of a machine-owned personal Connection. That is a
  refusal, never a silent downgrade — Gmail and Slack's hosted MCP are
  personal-only and must not become workspace-owned. This helper shares the
  following core checks with the pre-existing `requireConnectionAuthorityOwner`:
  `contextIntegrity`, exact authenticated/grant subject identity,
  `principalKind: "human_session"`, and no service-initiator provenance. This
  ownership-value helper intentionally adds a stricter defence-in-depth rejection
  for OpenGeni's reserved machine-subject namespaces; the predicates are not
  identical. Start-time ownership-value rejection is a 422, while the sibling
  self-owner authority surface uses a 403.

  An OAuth callback carries signed state, not a live principal, so it cannot
  re-evaluate `principalKind`. Every start path that may persist a personal owner
  now stamps a `personalOwnerVerified` claim into its HMAC-signed state, and **all
  five** callbacks that can persist one — Integration Definition OAuth, MCP OAuth,
  Google Drive, Atlassian, and social — require it. A state minted before the
  claim existed lacks it and fails closed, which closes the one `oauthStateTtlMs`
  in-flight window across a rolling deploy and is why the MCP callback's legacy
  `?? "personal"` decode can no longer land a machine-owned row.
  Callback refusals use each flow's existing bounded redirect/error projection;
  they are not uniformly surfaced as HTTP 422 (for example, Integration
  Definition OAuth reports `connection_conflict` and social OAuth reports
  `not_authorized`).

  ## Existing rows

  No schema change and no data migration. Existing personal Connections owned by a
  machine subject already sit on the `legacy_user` authority lane
  (`bind_connection_authority` mints the `user` scope only for a subject with an
  active organization membership), they remain listable and readable, and they
  **are** runtime-resolvable today: `personalConnectionDelegationSourceForGrant`
  returns a subject source for an `api_key` grant, so an api_key-owned Connection
  still resolves for that api_key. Credential-broker refresh-token renewal is
  untouched.

  What they lose is any **re-consent path**: interactive OAuth start refuses the
  machine principal, callbacks fail closed through their flow-specific
  redirect/error projections, and migration 0256 makes the owner column immutable,
  so the owner cannot be converted in place. When such a Connection's stored
  refresh token finally fails, the remediation is to create a replacement
  Connection as workspace-owned (or personal, connected by the human who should
  own it), repoint the capability at it, then revoke the stale row. Survey the
  population before upgrading:

  ```sql
  select coalesce(authority_scope, '(pre-0256)') as scope,
         split_part(subject_id, ':', 1) as subject_prefix,
         count(*)
  from connections
  where subject_id is not null
  group by 1, 2
  order by 3 desc;
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 3e1ad07: Add turn-atomic personal Variable Set and Rig attachments for create, Send, and
  Steer, including logical-turn once receipts, recovery-safe snapshots, warning
  acknowledgement, and SDK contracts.
- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- dc8c73f: Add professional organization administration with canonical rename and a
  Personal-safe shared-workspace access inventory, explicit Organization /
  Workspace / Only-me scope at Rig and Variable Set creation, and activation-gated
  atomic private visibility when creating sessions.
- fbc760e: Add the first-party `goal_wait` MCP tool and a durable goal continuation hold.
  An orchestrator whose active goal depends on child sessions or an external
  event records a bounded hold (reason plus mandatory deadline, at most 7 days)
  with a `goal.held` timeline fact instead of busy-polling. The continuation
  materializer returns `held` while the declaring turn is still the latest
  finished turn and the deadline is ahead: it never consumes the goal wake
  revision and re-arms a delayed workflow wake at the deadline on every idle
  evaluation. Pending machine input wins with `queue`, and any newer finished
  turn, a passed deadline, or a human/API/agent goal mutation clears the hold.
  The goal projection reports a current hold as `blocked` / `held_for_input`
  with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline (rolling migration 0317).
- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- fe54954: Add an authorized, quiescence-fenced API and SDK operation for permanently deleting a root session tree.
- 8cb165d: Add the default-off personal GitHub smart-HTTP broker and managed-sandbox runtime consumer.
  Short encrypted attempt-bound bearers and stable repository-bound routes keep broad OAuth
  credentials server-side while exact connection, selection, live provider permission, and
  read/write authority are revalidated before every streamed Git request.
- f7497fd: Add a disabled-by-default, user-owned personal GitHub OAuth lifecycle with
  separate deployment credentials, signed PKCE state, encrypted token custody,
  verified GitHub identity, typed SDK routes, reconnect fencing, and idempotent
  disconnect.
- ff011e6: Add bounded owner-only personal GitHub repository discovery, immutable selected-repository
  authority storage, full-replacement and verification APIs, typed SDK methods, and exact
  accepted-turn/scheduled-task authority snapshots for explicitly bound repository resources.
  The dedicated `connectionType: "github_personal"` resource discriminator preserves existing
  host-opaque Git credential bindings without reclassifying them as personal OAuth authority.
  Runtime Git and GitHub API execution remain unavailable until their separately audited broker
  and provider-consumer phases land.
- ba0be3d: Add activation-gated owner management for personal-resource session and standing grants, with kind-derived actions and permissions, exact session authority epochs, route-workspace-fenced revocation, RFC3339 lifecycle timestamps, bounded keyset pages, complete credential-free delegation receipts, FORCE-RLS-safe expiry and invalid-action settlement, and SDK methods that intentionally exclude standalone `once` and custom expiry.
- c7cafb1: Activate owner-only session visibility changes and same-workspace private forks
  through the public API and SDK after per-organization tenancy activation.

  Expose activation-gated session tenancy metadata, typed quiescence and
  idempotency conflicts, exact durable event fanout, and explicit retry fences.

- 5a651c8: Add the blocking first-party `session_wait` MCP tool so an agent can wait for new durable events on child or peer sessions, or for its own pending machine input, in one bounded call instead of sleeping and polling `session_events`/`session_get`/`sessions_list`.
- 48b9f09: Allow organization administrators to invite an email before registration, bind
  the invitation only after exact Better Auth email verification, and apply its
  initial shared-workspace access when the invited user joins without creating a
  redundant fallback organization.

### Patch Changes

- 3825727: Normalize legacy or malformed workspace-membership permissions before member listing and authorization, without restoring any obsolete authority.
- 9b4d5d5: Create Stripe invoices for prepaid-credit Checkout payments and expose an authorized Stripe Customer Portal session for invoices and payment information.
- 650d6f9: Route OpenSandbox browser and computer streams through the API frame-proxy so the workbench can show live JPEG/RFB when the lifecycle proxy cannot carry browserd WebSocket grants.
- d8ba09d: Make private children inherit their parent's visibility through an exact live-attempt capability, expose effective tool policy in session monitoring, keep late child results from restarting settled parents, and preserve private-owner authority on internal-update turns.
- 3b6b30e: Make the workspace control prefix fair and bounded: `lockWorkspaceInferenceControl` takes a FIFO transaction advisory lock before the row lock so Pause/Resume cannot be starved by continuous shared claim/settlement/append traffic, Send/Steer/queued Steer/realtime sync hold the prefix shared while the target branch is active and escalate through a savepoint only for a paused branch, and request-scoped API mutations fail with a typed retryable `WorkspaceControlBusyError` (HTTP 503) instead of parking a pooled connection and snapshot when the prefix stays busy.
- 3eb159a: Give the API a wider postgres pool so rail polls no longer jam a 10-wide checkout, and make the workspace switcher open and list every accessible workspace.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2cb04e0: Retire Memory V1's standing prompt block and its agent writes. `memoryPromptMode` is now always `retrieval_only`: no pinned/recency working set is injected into any agent prompt, and the `legacy_standing` rollback opt-out can no longer be selected. The `memory_save` and `memory_correct` first-party tools are removed; durable agent writes go through `remember` (explicit user-directed) and task-note promotion (the agent's own findings), while `memory_search` remains so an agent can still read what a workspace knows.

  Nothing is rewritten or deleted: `knowledge_memories` rows, human REST/UI audit, search, correction, export, and the Memory Slack publication path are unchanged. A workspace that stored `legacy_standing` keeps the stored value in its passthrough settings bag, where it simply stops meaning anything, and already accepted turns keep the mode they recorded because those snapshots are immutable facts about what was composed. Migration 0295 changes no data; it reports whether anything was still relying on the mode rather than assuming it was unused.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- c297fc0: Add permission-first Company Brain guidance, Knowledge, proposal, and content-free accepted-turn context inspection surfaces.
- c297fc0: Add the permission-filtered Company Brain read and deterministic OKF export
  surface, subject-scoped full guidance history, and the Company Brain discovery
  and export experience.
- c297fc0: Route derived Company Brain proposals through the immutable workspace learning-policy snapshot before destination admission.
  Add exact rooted Task-note to proposed workspace Knowledge promotion with immutable value-free provenance and replay-safe MCP tools.
  Add atomic Task-note correction/revert with immutable old/new lineage, strict attempt/version fencing, and replay-safe first-party tooling.
- e9aabaa: Wire the governed-learning evaluator and activation controller into the Company Brain learning-policy router. Ways-of-working proposals now record a content-free decision receipt after they commit; under `automatic`, an eligible preference decision is activated through the destination lifecycle (instruction policy keeps a human activation boundary). The route receipt gains `learning`, `learningFailure`, and activation receipt/destination facts; `activation.activated` is no longer always `false`.
- 1f860f0: Add durable publication and authenticated download support for session sandbox files. Agents can publish bounded `/workspace` outputs through a first-party tool, raw sandbox links can recover through the session API, retained file receipts render with downloads, and retained screenshots expose an explicit download action.
- c297fc0: Add atomic rooted Task-note promotion into inactive instruction-policy and
  preference proposals while preserving exact source evidence, replay identity,
  and human-only activation.
- 4eb7abd: `remember` with `lane: knowledge` now returns `confirmation_required` bound to the Knowledge claim, and `remember_confirm` (`claimId`) approves the claim through the Knowledge review lifecycle after the exact initiating human answered the bound canonical question with `save` (rolling migration 0274, `confirm_remember_knowledge_claim`, immutable `remember_knowledge_confirmation_receipts`). `remember_confirm` accepts either `proposalId` + `decisionReceiptId` (preference / instruction policy) or `claimId` (knowledge); the confirm receipt carries `claimId` and a `knowledge` activation summary with `undo: knowledge_review`.
- 89d4ab3: Add the explicit user-directed `remember` / `remember_confirm` agent tools. Content becomes exact task-note evidence promoted through the learning-policy router; a preference activates immediately under `automatic`, Knowledge stays proposal-only, and everything else returns a bound `request_human_input` payload whose `save` answer authorizes activation through the new rolling migration 0272 `activate_human_confirmed_learning_decision` capability (`authority_kind = human_confirmed`, human-input request id recorded on the receipt).
- 7454580: Retire the legacy Memory V1 `memory_save` agent tool from the default retrieval-only surface: it is now compatibility-only, excluded from the default first-party tool catalog, and registered only when a workspace opts into the `legacy_standing` rollback mode. Agents save user-directed knowledge through `remember` and their own findings through task notes and governed promotion; `memory_search` and `memory_correct` remain.
- f72563d: Slack now has exactly two authorities: the personal hosted Slack MCP grant and the OpenGeni workspace bot. The workspace-owned hosted Slack MCP connection is removed: OAuth start, reconnect, the callback fence, and capability enablement reject an explicit non-personal ownership for `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`, an omitted ownership on that resource defaults to personal, and `listEnabledMcpCapabilityServers` no longer runs a workspace-scoped Slack MCP installation enabled by an earlier release. The bot manifest and canonical bot allowlist gain the bot-token Real-time Search scopes `search:read.public`, `search:read.files`, and `search:read.users` as requested-but-not-required extras; apply them to the Slack app before deploying, since the install URL requests every requested scope. The bot search tool itself is a separate change.
- c297fc0: Complete governed goal rewrites with strict agent change metadata, immutable
  proposal rejection and CAS-fenced rollback, bounded revision pagination, and
  accepted-turn root constraints that child agents may inherit or narrow. The
  original raw-array goal-revision list remains unchanged; bounded pagination is
  available through a separately named API and SDK surface.

### Patch Changes

- 1aa02d4: Ship the branded macOS Connected Machine icon from every control plane and
  promote the existing signed agent 0.1.15 release as the default stable channel.
- db758f3: Publish governed-learning activations and undos to the configured workspace Slack channel through the existing durable publication outbox. The dead durable-learning adapter (`publishDurableLearningOutcomeToSlack`) is replaced by `publishGovernedLearningEventToSlack`, which projects only content-free receipt facts, uses `governed-learning:<event>:<receiptId>` idempotency, and fails closed for Slack-derived evidence.
- 6a8954f: The `remember` and `memory_search` tool descriptions now state where saved facts actually live: a confirmed `lane: knowledge` fact enters the human-reviewed Knowledge claim lifecycle (not workspace memory), and indexed workspace documents are searched with `knowledge_search`/`knowledge_get` on the separate Document Search (docs) MCP server rather than through workspace `memory_search`.
- 16cbd7b: Make `retrieval_only` the default Company Brain memory prompt mode. An absent or unrecognized workspace `memoryPromptMode` now removes the broad Memory V1 standing block, excludes legacy preference-kind rows from agent search, and omits the company profile from child prompts; an explicit `legacy_standing` remains the per-workspace rollback opt-out. Rolling migration 0271 applies the same fallback at turn acceptance so frozen snapshots and the contracts resolver agree.
- 6860c5f: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private scopes for Rigs and Connected Machines. Personal machine use and Rig materialization now revalidate exact-attempt grants, membership, workspace access, authority epochs, and generations before runtime access.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

### Patch Changes

- a551666: Fix local Gmail provider OAuth callbacks, Google scope equivalence, stable
  Discovery compilation, and installed API integration visibility in session
  tool selection.

- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- 234a5e7: Replay exact completed Integration facet configure receipts before mutable instance, Connection, or provider validation while preserving request conflicts and exact-subject isolation.
- c056063: Project exact Integration Facet ownership so shared or externally managed bindings are read-only and direct removal reports retained owners truthfully.

  from execution progress, and add policy-controlled rewrite proposals with API,
  SDK, MCP, and runtime support.

### Minor Changes

- 8beed26: Add workspace-governed Slack shared-conversation task policies with durable enforcement and public contracts, and enforce vertical-only agent session authority across core and persistence.
- 8beed26: Add managed-human organization membership discovery. Expose the exact active
  self-membership and personal-workspace identity returned by the existing
  narrow provisioning capability through a managed-session-only API route and
  typed SDK method, while denying delegated/API-key principals and terminal
  memberships.
- 8beed26: Activate server-authoritative session visibility and content forking. Add user-private session ownership, authority-epoch transitions, explicit cross-workspace fork operations, session-scoped RLS actor propagation, and API authorization that preserves workspace-shared access while enforcing private-session ownership.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace provider presets and nullable integration identities with immutable Integration Definitions. Curated and workspace-authored integrations now share one definition-based contract, provenance model, OAuth callback, SDK route, runtime projection, and maintenance migration with no legacy API alias or fallback authority.
- 1e78f58: Make Facet definitions and bindings authoritative throughout the Integration domain. Public routes, SDK methods, Pack components, owner identities, physical tables, persisted manifests, and runtime projections now use one Facet vocabulary with a maintenance cutover and no compatibility aliases.
- 746bbbe: Add canonical human identities with multiple verified login bindings, revisioned and audited lifecycle operations, immediate session invalidation, fail-closed recovery and collision handling, and metadata-minimal managed identity API routes.
- 1e78f58: Make normalized Plugin, Version, Skill Facet, and component-owner records authoritative for curated and imported Skills. Add reviewed library install, list, update, preview, and uninstall contracts; preserve Pack and Plugin ownership independently; and retire every non-MCP row from the generic capability catalog and installation ledger through a collision-free maintenance migration.

### Patch Changes

- d15d3e8: Repair the Slack reaction-task experience with initial-only session links, disabled link/media unfurls, workspace-service-principal delivery, conservative terminal-output coalescing, direct execution of safe specified requests, and bounded deterministic import of exact reacted-message PNG/JPEG/WebP attachments as reference-only workspace files.

### Minor Changes

- aeb07f4: Add durable workspace decision publication to verified Slack bot channels with immutable configuration revisions, outbox attempts and receipts, bounded retries and terminal states, admin review/history UX, typed SDK methods, and a post-persistence governed-learning outcome adapter.

### Patch Changes

- 87e9ae6: Add durable Google Drive Changes cursors, Shared Drive-aware delta draining,
  bounded full reconciliation, cursor-invalid repair, and a default-off
  Workspace Events wake seam. Normalize My Drive's root alias before ancestry
  checks and preserve cumulative item, provider-request, and elapsed budgets
  across delta, continuation, and full-repair checkpoints. Carry bounded
  per-object revision floors across delta-to-full and checkpointed full scans so
  older or equal Drive revisions cannot regress accepted metadata/current-version
  state, fail closed on conflicting fallback identities, and keep the first
  observation in one scan generation as a durable monotonic floor. Fence item
  version/metadata writes plus checkpoint and terminal cursor settlement to the
  exact lease, initiating subject, scan, checkpoint generation, and accepted
  floor, so a lost full-page checkpoint cannot replay version 8 as version 7.
- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.
- ff7203c: Add a read-only Atlassian Jira and Confluence connector with shared OAuth setup, selected-source live agent search and reads, and optional governed knowledge synchronization.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- b46f4de: Add a compact, cursor-paginated agent-topology read surface with root, direct-child, and search filters for lazy hierarchy browsers.
- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.
- a858835: Add unambiguous Slack installation bindings and a token-free, subject-bound workspace access-request lifecycle for signed Slack identity links.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- 7954468: Recognize threaded Slack mentions delivered as message events, include bounded invocation context, and avoid duplicate final replies or repeated session links.
- d1db1d3: Make agent-spawned workers inherit omitted model, reasoning, and latency settings from the exact calling turn so Codex subscription sessions do not silently fall back to OpenGeni-credit models.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.
- 90eea29: Make connected-machine removal show every dependent session and support an explicit canonical move-to-default-sandbox confirmation before revocation. Default moves prove managed sandbox readiness through the existing fleet route, active turns remain fail-closed, and typed swap rejections surface as visible errors instead of false success.

- 7b65614: Keep over-limit viewer-only sandboxes drained until a fresh serialized balance
  or monthly-cap evaluation clears a durable workspace admission gate. Viewer
  reattach can no longer re-arm a draining box or spawn a cold successor, while a
  turn-held sandbox remains viewable.

- 387cb73: Return the canonical validation envelope when a knowledge-search request exceeds the maximum result limit.
- ddff8db: Add the read-only Workspace State inventory with bounded, authorization-scoped
  Documents aggregates and a deterministic metadata-only Memory projection. The
  projection explicitly labels legacy `knowledge_memories` preference-kind counts
  as non-authoritative observations while preserving the structured preference
  registry as the sole active preference authority.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f6f13f: Add the isolated, versioned organization/workspace/user preference registry,
  including audited proposal and activation flows, deterministic attempt-bound
  descriptors, authorized full-content retrieval, REST/MCP tools, and SDK types.
  Attempt reads revalidate current generation and immutable-human authority in one
  locked transaction; lifecycle writes use scope-version CAS and database-owned
  audit functions that prevent direct head mutation or history erasure. Snapshot
  creation is database-canonical and lifecycle governance requires a signed
  `human_session` principal; expiry filtering and supersession are transactionally
  enforced before bounds or terminal mutation.

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f9305b: Add a host-owned session authorization port for embedded deployments. The port
  receives server-resolved root lineage and live agent-attempt authority, scopes
  session listing inside database queries, distinguishes exact from whole-tree
  projection access, gates HTTP/core/first-party MCP/Toolspace surfaces, and
  periodically reauthorizes idle SSE streams while standalone deployments retain
  their existing behavior when the port is unset.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- 8c66185: Let agent-created child sessions inherit omitted repository, MCP tool, and
  per-session MCP server context from their trusted immediate parent. Explicit
  arrays remain authoritative, mixed Git providers and multiple bindings are
  preserved, and credential headers are copied only as encrypted ciphertext.
- 3ce795b: Route Toolspace token seeding, renewal, agent commands, and Channel-A terminal
  commands through deterministic per-session files when several sessions share a
  sandbox group. Preserve the box manifest's stable legacy pointer for warm-box
  compatibility, remove any legacy bearer during seeding, and prevent the
  group-global ttyd process from inheriting session-bound Toolspace authority.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- 0c4796d: Bound opt-in `sessions_list` latest-message previews by a deterministic aggregate UTF-8 budget.
  Rows that exceed the budget remain discoverable with explicit omission metadata and a
  `session_events` drill-down route, while the existing response envelope and pagination cap remain
  independent.
- 5529945: Support Temporal Cloud and secured external Temporal endpoints across every API
  and worker connection. API-key authentication enables TLS automatically, while
  optional server-auth TLS, SNI override, custom root CA, and paired mTLS
  certificate settings share one validated connection policy.

### Minor Changes

- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

### Patch Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

### Patch Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

### Patch Changes

- b34b912: Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

  Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

  When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.
