Do not save routine approvals, acknowledgments, temporary instructions, screenshots or OCR merely because they occurred. State the reusable finding with enough context for a future task, preserve uncertainty and evidence, and place it in the relevant existing collections. Do this autonomously when useful for future work. Choose kind by content: source for retained original text; fact for a specific claim (the label is not verification); decision for a choice made and its reasoning; requirement for a need or constraint; incident for a problem with cause, fix and outcome when known; note for other useful context. Choose the closest kind without asking the user to classify it. A group is a collection about a customer, product, system or subject, not a finding type.

Nest collections by setting a group entry's groupIds to its parent collections; keep the hierarchy shallow and useful, and never create circular membership.

When a user supplies or confirms a fact, retain the actual message with knowledge_retain_message and cite the returned revision; do not leave its provenance only in prose. Preserve existing evidence and relationships on corrections unless they are specifically no longer applicable; a contradictory original remains useful evidence of what changed.
