# Vue conversation: Harbor guest desk

A genuinely non-React host: Vue 3 single-file components and a Composition API
composable, Vite, and the packaged `createSessionProxyHandler` mounted on
`Bun.serve`. Embedding Opengeni stays one backend route plus your own UI: the
browser talks only to its own origin, and the proxy acts as your authenticated
user with the server-held organization API key. It uses the **published**
`@opengeni/sdk@1.1.0`; no repository SDK aliases, React packages, runtime
embedding, new backend framework, or public deployment are needed. The UI is
Harbor's, not Opengeni's. For a React product, mount `OpenGeniChat` from
`@opengeni/react` behind the same proxy instead (see the
[SDK README](../../packages/sdk/README.md#embed-the-conversation-default)).

## Install and run

Requirements: Bun 1.3.10+, Node 22.12+ on `PATH` (`bun run` executes the
Vite and `vue-tsc` CLIs with Node; `vue-tsc` does not typecheck `.vue` files
under the Bun runtime), and an existing managed Opengeni deployment with a
server-held full-access organization API key.
The deployment needs agent configuration admission and human input enabled,
session tenancy/private chats activated, and an available model/credits for the
acting user. Single-user `local` access mode does not admit external actors.

```sh
cd examples/vue-conversation/app
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill the **server-only** `OPENGENI_API_BASE_URL` and `OPENGENI_API_KEY` in
`.env.local`; the organization id is derived from an organization API key, so
`OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_ID` is needed only for a key that is not bound to one
organization. Choose stable host tenant/user/source IDs. Generate an onboarding operation UUID with
`bun -e 'console.log(crypto.randomUUID())'`, save it as
`OPENGENI_MEMBER_OPERATION_ID` **before** the next command, and reuse it on
retries. Do not put credentials in a `VITE_` variable or browser config.

```sh
bun run onboard
```

This explicit onboarding step ensures the tenant's organization workspace and
grants only `workspace:read`, `sessions:create`, `sessions:read`, and
`sessions:control` to the admitted external user. Save the printed
`OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_ID` in `.env.local`. It does not enable private chats,
configure models, grant admin, or repair revoked memberships. For an existing
mapping, omit onboarding and use the already-admitted user/workspace.

Run in two terminals from this directory:

```sh
bun run server
bun run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3104` and select **Sign in to local demo**. Vite forwards
`/api` to the backend on port 4104; the browser only contacts its own origin.
Ask a question, refresh the page, choose the saved conversation, send a follow-up,
and pause/resume it. Status, queued-message notice, reconnect state, errors and
saved-request retry are visible.

For the built app on a single origin:

```sh
bun run build
# Change HOST_ORIGIN in .env.local to http://127.0.0.1:4104 first.
bun run start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4104`. Only `/` and built `/assets/*` are served; source,
environment files and arbitrary service paths are not public.

## Authentication and tenancy boundary

The launcher is intentionally **loopback-only** with `HOST_DEMO_AUTH=1` and an
explicit local demo login. It issues an opaque, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict,
one-hour cookie backed by a server-side map. Browser request bodies cannot select
a tenant/user/workspace. The demo map is ephemeral: restart requires signing in
again, but the upstream conversations remain durable.

For a real host, reuse `createHostHandler` from `app/src/host.ts` in its existing
backend instead of deploying this demo launcher. Supply:

```ts
const handler = createHostHandler(serverOnlyClient, {
  origin: "https://your-host.example",
  authenticate: async (request) => {
    const user = await yourExistingVerifiedSession(request);
    if (!user) return null;
    const tenant = await yourAuthorizedTenantMapping(user);
    return {
      tenantId: tenant.id,
      userId: user.id,
      workspaceId: tenant.openGeniWorkspaceId,
      source: "your-stable-identity-namespace",
      csrf: await yourSessionCsrfToken(user),
    };
  },
});
```

Those placeholder functions belong to the host's existing authentication and
mapping store; they are not SDK functions. Use verified cookie sessions and
server-side tenant membership, never raw actor headers, query IDs, browser
storage, a Personal/default workspace fallback, or the organization key itself
as user authority. Switch storage/UI context when your host changes accounts.

Each request resolves this identity; the packaged proxy pins that workspace,
acts via `asUser(userId, { source })`, and enforces its native route allowlist.
Cookie writes require both the configured exact Origin and `x-host-csrf` from
the authenticated host context. No wildcard CORS. Private sessions enforce
creator visibility; listing is the proxy's default `mine`. For a conversation
bound to a business record, also provide the proxy's `authorizeSession` hook
using your record ownership store.

Creation policy stays on the server: private chat, no sandbox, no tools, no
bundled implementation Skills, Harbor identity, `renderer: "markdown"`, and
`humanInput` from otherwise-minimal capabilities. The browser supplies only
initial text and an idempotency key. Files and browser model selection are off.

## Durable lifecycle and supported UI

- `createSession`: a pending initial message + idempotency key is retained in
  tenant/user-scoped `sessionStorage` before sending. Explicit retries reuse it.
- `sendMessage`: the saved request keeps its `clientEventId` and exact text after
  an uncertain failure or reload. Retry does not invent another ID.
- Reopen: list the current user's sessions, restore the selected ID, replay from
  sequence zero to rebuild the in-memory projection, then continue the SDK's
  stream. Never persist only a cursor while dropping its projection.
- `streamEvents` owns replay, reconnect/backoff, duplicate suppression and gap
  backfill. Selection changes and unmount abort old streams; generation guards
  prevent old-session state/errors replacing the new selection.
  Identity epochs additionally fence context loads and mutation completions;
  account changes reset UI/drafts and never clear another account's saved retry.
- Session read and pending human-input reads reconcile at stream connection and
  lifecycle changes. Unknown additive event types are tolerated, not displayed
  as accidental tool prose. Text deltas reconcile with completed messages and
  terminal output; failure/status are separate from prose.
- Pause is resumable, not terminal cancel. Messages sent while paused queue.
- Approvals fold `session.requiresAction`'s stable `approvals[].id/name/arguments`
  shape; decisions remove old cards and turn settlement clears only that turn's
  approvals. Responses use `sendApprovalDecision` with a stable operation ID.
- Human input supports text, single/multi-select, required fields, Other,
  selection bounds, expiry and optional Skip via `submitHumanInputResponse`.
  The service remains the authority for validation and stale-request conflicts.

This is a deliberately small **escaped text** UI, not a full rich Markdown,
artifact/file/tool timeline or workbench renderer. Vue interpolation never runs
agent HTML (`v-html` is not used). Runtime error copy is host-owned; raw upstream
diagnostic messages are not exposed in the host UI. The sample attaches no
business tools, so approvals need your reviewed tool configuration in a real
host; preview approval events are synthetic, not proof of a hotel booking.

## Verify and preview

```sh
bun run test
bun run typecheck
bun run build
# With bun run dev already listening (no API key/backend needed):
bun run preview:check
```

`app/src/visual-check.ts` renders the **actual** Vue components with clearly
synthetic HTTP/SSE fixtures. It verifies replay, refresh, create/send, approval,
human input, error/retry, pause/resume and mobile layout, then writes desktop,
decision and mobile PNGs into `/workspace/previews` in the managed sandbox,
or `app/previews` on other hosts (override with `VUE_PREVIEW_OUTPUT`). Set
`VUE_CHROMIUM` to an installed executable, or run `bunx playwright install chromium`.
Without an override it uses the sandbox binary when present, otherwise
Playwright's installed default browser, including on ordinary Linux hosts.
No production or public host is provisioned. Synthetic checks are separate from
live service/model execution, which needs the deployment prerequisites above.

The standalone `app/bun.lock` is intentional. The app is one level below the
root Bun workspace glob (`examples/*`), so `bun install` in `app` resolves the
published SDK from the registry and a root install cannot silently substitute
the unpublished local SDK source. Run consumer commands from `app`, not root
Bun scripts. Consumer checks use Bun's `.spec.ts` convention and the local
`bun run test` command; they are not discovered by the root workspace's
`.test.ts`-only CI unit shards.
