This guide is for a host application that embeds OpenGeni instead of running it only as the stock API + worker service. Embedding means binding host-owned concerns (identity, tenancy, billing admission, credentials, persistence, worker process, and event bus) into the same OpenGeni domain/runtime code the standalone stack uses.

The contract is simple: **all ports unset means standalone**. The defaults in `apps/api/src/index.ts`, `apps/worker/src/activities.ts`, and `packages/db/src/index.ts` preserve the normal local/self-hosted deployment behavior. An embedded host opts in by binding only the seams it owns.

## Consumption Shapes

### Participant-owned MCP connections

Use ordinary native connections, optionally scoped to the canonical user.
The integrating backend uses `asUser()` to provision that user's connection
through the ordinary connection API. Each accepted Send selects its own native
connection authority; configuration and conversation visibility alone do not
grant another participant's connection access.
An empty `startMode: "realtime"` create has no turn and takes no selection;
the first text `sendMessage` captures its own explicit selection normally.
Native OAuth refresh rotates credentials without changing the captured user.
Schedules and children use native captured execution context, not a callback
registry or the scheduler's technical identity. See the
[architecture map](architecture.md) and [cutover notes](remote-mcp-credentials.md).

### Skill reading in direct runtime hosts

For direct `buildOpenGeniAgent` use, pass `skillActivations` to provide immutable
Skill files. The runtime derives a bounded descriptor catalog and an eager
in-memory `skill_read` from those same files, independently of compute backend.
The reader supports default `SKILL.md`, explicit multiple `paths`, and
`listFiles: true` inventory. It does not start a sandbox or install a Skill.

Alternatively, a host that owns its catalog and reader supplies `skillCatalog`
and its authorized `skill_read` through the tool gateway, as the stock worker
does. An explicit catalog, including `[]`, prevents implicit runtime bundles or
a duplicate reader. Do not combine that host-owned mode with `skillActivations`.
The descriptor layer is rendered when the agent is constructed, not appended as
a history message or rewritten by lazy tool discovery. See
[turn-attempt catalog timing](run-lifecycle.md).

The stock worker also supplies lazy management and filesystem checkout tools;
direct runtime construction alone does not provision those workspace services.
Repository Skill discovery remains a separate index of files already on disk.

### Product UI

**Host-rendered product UI.** A host that keeps its own visual shell can consume
`@opengeni/react/session`. The subpath exposes the session event, composer,
queue and control hooks plus pure timeline projection, without importing the
styled workbench graph. Pass a proxy implementing the subpath's narrow
`SessionClientLike` plus host-safe workspace/session aliases through each
hook's `{ client, workspaceId }` override when workspace-global provider
behavior is not appropriate. The proxy does not need billing, sandbox environments, files,
terminal, workbench, or workspace-administration methods; workspace-level
Resume is optional.

**OpenGeni-rendered product UI.** A host that mounts the styled React surfaces
should use `SessionConversation` from `@opengeni/react` (or `/session-ui`) for
a complete existing-session chat: `<SessionConversation sessionId={id} />`
under `OpenGeniProvider`. A standalone product backs both with
`createSessionProxyHandler`. It wires queue actions, composer drafts, model policy,
pause/resume, tool approvals, attachments, human-input forms, optimistic delivery, and paged timeline history.
`ChatComposer` alone is only the input surface. Hosts with deliberately custom
flows can still compose the individual hooks and components.

The host owns available space; `SessionConversation` fills its container by
default. Use a sized page/panel with `min-height: 0` on intervening flex/grid
children. The SDK scrolls the timeline internally and keeps the composer at
the panel bottom. Do not add a second timeline scroller or fixed/sticky composer.

Agent replies link files, sandbox paths, editable artifacts, and Sites with
`artifact:`, `sandbox:`, and OpenGeni console paths that do not exist on the
host origin. `SessionConversation` downloads retained files by default;
sandbox paths require explicit proxy `sandboxFiles: true` and stay within the
session working directory without following symlinks.
route artifacts and Sites with its `resolveLink` prop (also on
`MessageTimeline` and `OpenGeniLinkProvider`), or `parseOpenGeniLink` from
`@opengeni/sdk` outside React. See
[links, files, artifacts, and Sites](product-integration.md#links-files-artifacts-and-sites-in-replies).

A host that mounts the styled React surfaces
can import `@opengeni/react/compiled.css` once. That package-owned artifact is
already compiled from the component source with Tailwind v4, contains no global
Preflight or `--tw-*` property registrations, and scopes rules to the `.og-root`
roots applied by the components. The host therefore needs no Tailwind compiler
or source scan. SDK form controls include a scoped baseline reset before their
utilities, so they do not depend on the host loading Preflight. Generic host
button styles do not replace those defaults; avoid targeting SDK descendants
with higher-specificity host selectors. `packages/react/demo/standalone-controls.html`
exercises this standalone path with deliberately conflicting host button CSS.
Tailwind runtime variables are initialized only within those
roots; independent defaults inherit without replacing host `--og-*` values,
while scoped effective values keep derived tokens live. The additive
`@opengeni/react/styles.css` bridge remains available when a Tailwind v4 host
intentionally wants to compile the package utilities itself. Import one styling
path, not both. Theme, density, and brand overrides remain runtime `--og-*`
tokens; portalled surfaces copy the effective tokens from their trigger onto
their own standalone `.og-root`.

**V1: mount the router.** Import `createApp(deps)` from `@opengeni/api-router/app` (`apps/api/src/app.ts`) and mount the returned Hono app under the host's route prefix. The dependency bag is `AppDependencies` from `@opengeni/core` (`packages/core/src/dependencies.ts`): `settings`, `db`, `bus`, and `workflowClient` are required; `documentIndexer`, `documentServices`, `observability`, `managedAuth`, `sessionAuthorization`, `sandboxClient`, and `resumeBoxById` are optional host bindings. The routes remain `/v1/...` inside the mounted app. If the mount prefix makes worker loopback wrong, set `OPENGENI_MCP_INTERNAL_URL` / `settings.opengeniMcpInternalUrl`. `OPENGENI_MCP_URL` remains the sandbox/external route used by Codemode and remote placements; `firstPartyMcpInternalBaseUrl` and `firstPartyMcpBaseUrl` in `packages/config/src/index.ts` own the split.

**V2: call core directly.** Import from `@opengeni/core` and call domain helpers without HTTP. The main session surface is:

```ts
createSessionForRequest(deps, grant, workspaceId, rawPayload);
acceptSessionUserMessage(deps, grant, workspaceId, sessionId, input);
submitComposerDraftForRequest(
  deps,
  grant,
  workspaceId,
  sessionId,
  submitComposerDraftRequest,
  {
    authorization,
    additionalResources: hostAuthorizedResources,
  },
);
controlHumanSessionWorkstream(deps, context, {
  action: "cancel",
  clientEventId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  reason: "host record deleted",
});
```

The create/message helpers live in `packages/core/src/domain/sessions.ts` and
expect the documented dependency slice plus an `AccessGrant`.
`submitComposerDraftForRequest` lives in
`packages/core/src/application/composer-submit.ts`; it is the composer-shaped
application boundary used by both the stock HTTP route and an in-process host.
It validates/accepts the exact durable draft revision, appends the event,
creates or steers the turn, rotates the draft, and returns the native
`SubmitComposerDraftResponse`. An in-process host may provide
`additionalResources`; they join the accepted command, idempotency hash, turn,
and durable session resource set atomically while the saved actor draft remains
the exact fence. This avoids a trusted draft PUT solely to add host-authorized
repositories or files. Terminal control lives in
`packages/core/src/application/session-commands.ts` and uses an explicit
authenticated command context. Scheduled-task validation/sync helpers live in
`packages/core/src/domain/scheduled-tasks.ts`. V2 skips Hono parsing/routing,
but it does not skip Postgres, EventBus, Temporal wakeups, or worker execution.

### Host prepare → native accept → host project

An embedding host may need its own business record before OpenGeni accepts
work. Keep that integration as three explicit phases rather than rebuilding the
composer protocol:

1. **Prepare:** authenticate the host actor, authorize the product operation,
   create or replay the host record with the browser's original
   `clientEventId`, and freeze host-owned policy/context.
2. **Native accept:** call `submitComposerDraftForRequest` once with the same
   `clientEventId` and return its exact response. Do not PUT a trusted draft,
   guess revisions, construct raw event JSON, or encode a host record id into
   the OpenGeni operation key.
3. **Project:** correlate the accepted event/turn/receipt back to the prepared
   host record. A projection failure after native commit must not mark native
   work failed; reconcile it from the idempotent receipt/export stream.

Host preparation and OpenGeni acceptance are not a distributed transaction.
A definite pre-acceptance failure may fail the host record. An ambiguous
network/process outcome must remain retryable and use the same request bytes and
`clientEventId`; OpenGeni then returns the committed replay or a hard
idempotency conflict.

For a host-rendered React session, construct the narrow client once instead of
copying/binding methods manually:

```ts
import { createEmbeddedSessionClient } from "@opengeni/react/session";

const sessionClient = createEmbeddedSessionClient(openGeniClient, {
  overrides: {
    // Calls the host's authenticated prepare/native-accept/project endpoint.
    submitComposerDraft: hostSubmitComposerDraft,
  },
  // Optional presentation/policy projection for read/save/submit responses.
  mapComposerDraft: (draft) => sanitizeHostDraft(draft),
});
```

Delegated SDK methods retain their original receiver, overrides retain the
override object as theirs, and construction fails immediately when a required
session method is missing. The native submit response is not replaced with a
fabricated success value.

**Runtime dependency isolation.** `@opengeni/runtime` bundles its OpenAI Agents
implementation together with the Zod 4 instance that defines those runtime
schemas. An embedding host does not need to adopt OpenGeni's Zod major and must
not patch or symlink the Agents dependency tree. The published type declarations
still reference the public Agents types, so the Agents packages remain declared
dependencies, but OpenGeni's executable `dist` contains no external Agents or
Zod import. The publish-closure guard enforces that boundary.

### Agent instructions and per-message application context

A host has two system-level instruction scopes, composed as **deployment default
template → workspace persona → per-session instructions**, with the
non-bypassable CORE (goal-loop ownership + variable set block) always
substituted in. Exact-message application context does not enter this prefix.

- **Workspace `agentInstructions`** (`Workspace.agentInstructions`, set at workspace create/update) — the white-label persona for _every_ session in a workspace. Use it for stable, tenant-wide branding/behavior. It may embed the `{{core}}` marker to place the non-bypassable CORE; if it omits the marker, CORE is appended.
- **Per-session `instructions`** (`CreateSessionRequest.instructions`) — an optional, per-_session_ refinement layered after the workspace persona. Use it to deliver a **per-agent-type prompt** (reviewer vs. planner vs. fixer) when many personas share one workspace, without minting a workspace per persona. It is org-visible metadata (returned on the session record, exposed like `title`/`goal`), never a timeline event, carries system-level authority, and is capped at 65536 characters.
- **Per-message `modelContext`** (`CreateSessionRequest.modelContext`,
  `SendMessageInput.modelContext`, and supported realtime inbound entries) —
  optional application context for one exact accepted message. OpenGeni stores
  it with the accepted turn/realtime entry, includes it as a separate
  `input_text` part in that same canonical user-role history item, and preserves
  it through queueing, steering, retry, approval resume, worker recovery, and
  realtime handoff. Standard timeline rendering displays only the visible
  message text; full event/audit reads retain `modelContext`. It is **not**
  secret, private, privileged, or system-level authority. For realtime voice,
  SDK/React hosts may provide `getModelContext`; OpenGeni captures its current
  bounded value once when each durable delegation or finalized transcript entry
  is created, without restarting the controller when the callback changes. A
  failing or oversized callback omits only that entry's context and does not
  discard or block the provider message.
- **Preallocated session identity** (`CreateSessionRequest.requestedSessionId`) — an optional UUID an embedding host may persist in its own projection before calling OpenGeni. OpenGeni creates that exact session and rejects collisions with `409`, so the initial worker claim cannot outrun the host link. Pair retries with the same workspace-scoped `idempotencyKey`; a replay that changes the UUID is rejected. The UUID is identity/correlation only and grants no access.

Use workspace `agentInstructions` for stable tenant-wide behavior and session
`instructions` for a durable session persona. Use `modelContext` for concise
submit-time route, selection, viewport, or entity context that belongs to the
user's current message but should not clutter the ordinary chat presentation.
Do not put secrets in it: authorized full event/audit surfaces may return the
exact value. When current product state must be read or mutated, prefer a
tenant-scoped tool over a large context snapshot.

Because `modelContext` is appended in the newest user history item rather than
composed into `Agent.instructions`, changing it does not rewrite the persistent
provider prefix or invalidate otherwise reusable prompt-cache bytes. OpenGeni
adds the message's acceptance time (minute-precision UTC with the weekday) to
that same history item as its own part, so hosts do not need to put the current
date or time in `modelContext`. Initial
`modelContext` requires `initialMessage`; a realtime shell attaches context to a
later delegation or finalized transcript entry instead. Values are trimmed,
non-empty, and capped at 32768 characters.

## Ports

### Identity Resolver Chain

Canonical source: `packages/core/src/access/index.ts`.

HTTP routes use `requireAccessContext(c, deps)` and `requireAccessGrant(c, deps, workspaceId, permission)`. The chain is selected by `settings.productAccessMode`:

- `local`: calls `bootstrapWorkspace` for the default local account/workspace.
- `configured`: accepts an `ogd_` delegated bearer when `settings.delegationSecret` is set; otherwise bootstraps a configured workspace using `x-opengeni-subject`.
- `managed`: tries a delegated bearer, then hashed API key, then `managedAuth.api.getSession(...)`.

There is no separate exported `IdentityResolver` type in this pass. A V1 host binds identity through `managedAuth`, delegation/API-key settings, and HTTP headers. A V2 host may resolve identity itself and pass an `AccessGrant` directly to core domain functions.

### Immutable turn identity

Canonical sources: `TurnInitiator` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`,
`packages/db/src/turn-initiator.ts`, and the producer transitions in
`packages/db/src/index.ts` / `packages/db/src/session-queue-commands.ts`.

Every session response carries a frozen `createdBy` principal and every turn
response carries its own frozen `initiator`. They are deliberately different
facts: the creator is used only for creation attribution and idempotent repair
of that create command's first turn. A later Send or Steer records the
authenticated actor of that command. Queue move/edit/resubmit preserves the
original turn authority. Recovery, approval, and retry update the existing turn
and cannot replace it.

`TurnInitiator.kind` is `subject | service`; `subjectId` remains opaque to
OpenGeni. Hosts must not encode or infer the kind from a subject-id prefix,
because the host owns that namespace. Agent-created work inherits the caller's
frozen principal only through the HMAC-signed session/turn/attempt claims minted
by the worker, and records a bounded `via` provenance chain. Scheduled,
compaction, goal-continuation, and mixed service-only internal-update turns use
named service principals. When ordinary machine notices coalesce with an Agent
Steer, the Steer's inherited subject remains authoritative and the notices are
context rather than a replacement principal. Pre-contract and rolling
old-writer rows are explicitly
`{ kind: "service", subjectId: "unattributed-legacy" }`; a host credential
resolver must deny that sentinel rather than substitute the session creator,
API-key owner, sandbox token, or current worker.

A trusted V1 embedding host may also sign `serviceInitiator` plus optional
`serviceInitiatorContext` into a domain-bound `ogd2_` delegated bearer. OpenGeni continues to
authorize the request with the bearer's ordinary `subjectId` and permissions,
but freezes the separately asserted service principal as causal provenance for
the new session/turn. The claim accepts only `kind: "service"`, cannot coexist
with exact agent turn/attempt claims, and is consumed only by commands that
create work; it cannot impersonate a human or change access. V2 core callers
can provide the same typed fields on their trusted `AccessGrant`. The optional
display label belongs on `serviceInitiator`, not in its context. Identity fields
and context are bounded; OpenGeni-owned lineage/backfill keys and the
`unattributed-legacy` migration sentinel are reserved.

Ordinary delegated and first-party/Codemode credentials remain `ogd_`. The
`ogd2_` prefix is included in its HMAC input so a service-provenance token fails
closed on an older verifier during rolling deployment and cannot be downgraded
by changing its prefix.

The normal first-party orchestration MCP and Codemode use distinct bearer
purposes but the same exact attempt authority. The worker re-signs first-party
requests with the current turn, attempt, and execution generation; an
agent-created child is accepted only while that attempt owns the turn, and the
ownership proof plus child insert share one transaction. The renewable sandbox
Codemode bearer carries that same attempt fence and can invoke every tool in the
frozen catalog—including admitted first-party tools—through the same executor.
It cannot widen the catalog, attach servers, mint authority, or survive a
successor attempt.

### Unified workspace tool gateway

Canonical sources: `@opengeni/tool-gateway`,
`prepareWorkspaceToolGatewayTools` in `@opengeni/runtime/workspace-tool-gateway`,
and the current-human adapters in `apps/api/src/workspace-tool-gateway.ts`.

Runtime preparation is the one provider-assembly seam for enabled first-party
and integration tools. Model MCP, Codemode, current-human MCP, HTTP/SDK, and
Site adapters project protocol-specific names from the same canonical catalog
and dispatch the same executor closures. Model names and generated JavaScript
paths are presentation only; authority is always the exact
`{ serverId, toolName }` identity plus the active catalog digest.

Attempt-frozen connector Allow/Ask/Block policy and connector-action request
rows belong to model/Codemode execution. Direct current-human HTTP/SDK and
workspace MCP calls use `requireApproval`; Sites use their separately verified
active-version bypass. Direct calls keep operation ids for provider-specific
handling but do not create a second generalized execution journal.

The ordinary browser SDK uses `/tools/catalog`, `/tools/calls`, and
`/tools/declarations`. Approval-required HTTP calls cannot trust a caller
boolean: the authenticated parent first creates a five-minute, hash-only,
single-use approval capability bound to the current human, operation, catalog,
identity, and arguments, then presents that token on the exact matching call.
After consumption, its hash-only row remains as an operation tombstone so the
same operation id cannot be approved again after an ambiguous provider outcome.
Live approval issuance and expiry queries use a subject-scoped partial index
that excludes consumed tombstones.
Sites use a different host-owned boundary: an active immutable Site version may
call its retained tool identities directly without per-call approval, while the
parent intersects that allowlist with the viewer's live catalog and the API
revalidates the active version on every call. The opaque-origin Site iframe
never receives a token. External MCP clients use the aggregate workspace MCP route;
deployments may opt into its resource-bound OAuth authorization server as
documented in `docs/deployment.md`. Because that MCP adapter has no
server-verifiable one-shot approval exchange, it omits tools classified for
human approval and rejects direct calls to their projected names. OAuth consent
does not satisfy that separate per-call approval requirement.

Workspace Sites retain a self-contained HTML runtime, bounded source bundle,
and requested tool identities per immutable version. The parent renders the
runtime in a sandboxed iframe and transfers one `MessagePort` only to that exact
`contentWindow`. It intersects the retained identities with the viewer's live
gateway, dispatches allowed calls directly, and aborts pending calls when the
Site reloads, stops, navigates, replaces its bridge port, or unmounts. Duplicate
live request ids are rejected, archived Sites receive no bridge, and no
credential, cookie, API URL, or parent DOM authority crosses into
publisher-controlled code. API response data may contain resource/workspace ids;
the Site cannot choose a different routing workspace.

### Session SDK inside a Site

`createOpenGeniSiteClient()` exposes `client` (the ordinary `OpenGeniClient`)
and `workspaceId` (the host-resolved `site-host` alias), alongside the existing
`tools` facade. Pass these directly to `OpenGeniProvider`. The shared session
HTTP surface includes sessions, durable drafts, and read-only provider context
(client config, workspace/model catalog and live event streams). Unrelated
administration endpoints are not exposed by this adapter.

Published frames forward requests through a response-specific MessagePort,
with pull-based chunks for SSE and cancellation on abort/unmount. The web host
supplies its current viewer authentication. Top-level sandbox previews use the
same `createCodemodeSiteRequestHandler()` mount: `/__opengeni/site-tools/sdk/*`
forwards to `/codemode/sdk/*`. That API validates the live attempt and frozen
catalog, then dispatches the ordinary REST handlers with an internal exact-
attempt credential limited to the session's existing session/workspace-read
permissions. It never changes the sandbox bearer or gives an agent human
approval authority. Normal resource authorization and command receipts apply.

See `examples/site-session-embed` for a standard React provider, timeline and
durable composer using this transport without knowing its execution location.

### Session Authorization

Canonical sources: `SessionAuthorizationPort` in
`packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, the enforcement helpers in
`packages/core/src/session-authorization.ts`, and the mounted HTTP/MCP/SSE
surfaces in `apps/api/src/`.

Workspace permissions answer whether a principal may use a capability at all.
An embedding host may additionally own per-session ownership, sharing, and
revocation by binding `AppDependencies.sessionAuthorization`:

```ts
type SessionAuthorizationPort = {
  authorizeSession(input: AuthorizeSessionInput): Promise<SessionAuthorizationDecision>;
  resolveListScope(
    input: ResolveSessionAuthorizationListScopeInput,
  ): Promise<SessionAuthorizationListScope>;
};
```

`authorizeSession` receives the account/workspace, requested operation and
surface, the immediate target plus its server-resolved lineage root, and either
the authenticated subject or a live exact agent attempt. Agent authority is
reconstructed from durable attempt ownership and includes the caller session,
caller root, turn, attempt, execution generation, and frozen initiator; caller
input cannot nominate those fields. A settled, superseded, interrupted, or
otherwise stale attempt is rejected before the host is called. Slack-private
and `user_private` owner checks also run before the host; the host may narrow
further and cannot grant those sessions. Cross-session agent access keeps
exact-target projection even when the host returns `relatedSessionAccess: "root"`.

An allowed decision may set `relatedSessionAccess: "root"` when the principal
may see the target's full tree. The fail-closed default is `"target"`: detail,
lineage, control, parent, and tree-stat projections remove information derived
from other sessions. This projection choice never authorizes an operation on a
second session; that target always receives its own authorization decision.

`resolveListScope` returns either `all` or a bounded database-applicable scope:
`rootSessionIds` include their descendants while `sessionIds` authorize exact
rows only. OpenGeni applies the scope inside search, pin, ordering, totals,
snapshot continuation, and MCP discovery queries. It does not hydrate a broad
page and filter afterward. Revocation between cursor pages skips newly hidden
rows and continues scanning to fill the next authorized page.

The same rule is load-bearing for advisory related-work discovery. The host
scope, OpenGeni private-session checks, and exact live caller authority are
materialized before title/active-goal/typed-claim matching, rank, counts,
relevance cursors, or ancestor expansion. A host must not filter a completed
discovery page in its adapter, because hidden rows would already have affected
those aggregates. Work claims remain non-exclusive evidence and cannot grant a
host or caller access; see [`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md).

Once the port is bound, unknown session-addressed HTTP routes fail closed. The
same policy is enforced by shared core mutation entrypoints, cross-session
first-party MCP tools, every session-bound first-party MCP transport request,
and Codemode. SSE performs an initial decision and reauthorizes even while
idle; hosts may request a 1–60 second interval and the default is 15 seconds.
Denied targets are externally indistinguishable from missing sessions; invalid
responses or an unavailable host return a retryable unavailable failure. All
ports unset preserves standalone behavior without the added lookups.

This port authorizes OpenGeni sessions; it does not replace OpenGeni's internal
delegated/MCP/stream credentials. The host still mints its ordinary user-facing
delegated token, while OpenGeni continues minting technical first-party tokens
and then consults this port with their durable caller authority.

#### Delegated tokens carry no personal-connection authority

A delegated grant never selects a subject's **personal** connections - not in a
personal workspace, and not in an ordinary shared workspace either. A session
created or steered through a host-minted delegated token gets workspace-owned
connections only; personal X/Reddit/Atlassian/Google Drive delegation is
omitted, exactly as it is for a member who never connected that provider.

This is deliberate and is a change in behaviour: before, a delegated grant did
pick up personal connections in shared workspaces, because a real
`workspace_memberships` row backed the lookup. A delegated payload's
`subjectId` and `workspaceId` are signed token fields with no database row
behind them (`delegatedAccessContext` builds the grant inline), so treating that
subject as authority to borrow someone's private provider credentials is not a
boundary OpenGeni is willing to hold. Denying it everywhere is the honest
version of the rule; scoping the denial to personal workspaces would have left
the same defect one room over.

Hosts that need agent runs to act on a user's personal provider account should
have that user connect it from a canonical signed-in OpenGeni session, which
freezes an ordinary personal-connection delegation onto the causal turn. See
`docs/organization-tenancy.md` for the authority model.

### Tenancy / Bootstrap Workspace

Canonical source: `bootstrapWorkspace` in `packages/db/src/index.ts`.

`bootstrapWorkspace(db, input)` receives external account/workspace identifiers, display names, a subject id/label, and optional permission arrays. It creates or updates the account, workspace, and membership rows, then returns an `AccessContext`.

The workspace remains the operational boundary. Route and core code must use the workspace id from the grant/path, not a resource id, as the access boundary.

### Entitlements / Admit Run

Canonical sources: `EntitlementsPort` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, core `checkLimit`/`requireLimit` in `packages/core/src/billing/limits.ts`, worker-side `ensureRunAllowed` in `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/admission.ts`.

`EntitlementsPort` is:

```ts
type EntitlementsPort = {
  admitRun(input: {
    accountId: string;
    workspaceId: string;
    action: string;
    quantity: number;
  }): Promise<EntitlementDecision>;
};
```

When bound on the worker through `ActivityDependencies.entitlements`, `admitRun` replaces local credit-balance admission for managed/Stripe-funded non-Codex turns. When unset, OpenGeni uses its local ledger/static limits exactly as standalone. The port is admission-only; metering remains the idempotency-keyed usage writer. In this branch the core API admission path still calls `requireLimit`; do not document an API-side entitlements binding until source wires one.

### Connection Credentials

Canonical sources: `ConnectionCredentialsPort` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`,
the worker consumers in `apps/worker/src/activities/`, and the exact attempt
catalog/dispatcher in `packages/runtime` and
`apps/worker/src/activities/codemode-dispatcher.ts`.

The port can bind any combination of its four legs:

```ts
type ConnectionCredentialsPort = {
  gitCredentials?(input: GitCredentialsRequest): Promise<GitCredentials>;
  sandboxSecrets?(input: SandboxSecretsRequest): Promise<SandboxSecrets>;
  runCredentials?(
    input: RunCredentialsRequest,
  ): Promise<RunCredentialsResolution>;
  mcpCredentials?(
    input: McpCredentialsRequest,
  ): Promise<McpCredentialResolution>;
};
```

`gitCredentials` is provider-aware and remains GitHub-backward-compatible.
`RepositoryResourceRef.credentialBindingId` names one independently mintable,
host-owned credential; it is opaque, bounded to 256 characters, and never used
raw in sandbox paths. `access: "read" | "write"` tells the host what token scope
the repository needs (omitted retains the historical write-capable behavior).
One session may attach any number of repositories across GitHub, GitLab, and
Azure DevOps, including more than one account/installation for the same
provider. A host must not use `provider` alone as credential identity.

Repository mounts are resource identity, not host-to-runtime mapping. An embedding
host may omit `mountPath`; OpenGeni then normalizes and persists
`repos/<encoded-host>/<owner>/<repo>`, including a non-default Git HTTPS port in
the encoded host segment. That keeps equal owner/repository names on GitHub,
GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts distinct. Explicit paths remain supported,
but are workspace-relative, separator-normalized, traversal-free, portable to
case-insensitive filesystems, and collision-checked before sandbox execution.
The normalized path is returned on the session resource and is the same value
used by the manifest, clone hook, agent filesystem, and workbench.
Repository URI normalization preserves the provider-defined HTTPS clone path;
OpenGeni never manufactures or removes a trailing `.git` suffix. Credential
routing and resource identity use an exhaustive provider capability policy:
GitHub and GitLab explicitly declare `.git` and suffix-free paths equivalent,
while Azure DevOps and provider-neutral remotes use exact paths. Adding a Git
provider therefore requires choosing its path semantics rather than silently
inheriting GitHub behavior. Mount-path and display-name derivation are separate
from the clone transport URI.

A repository resource may carry `optional: true` to make its materialization
best effort: when its clone fails (for example the repository is empty, the
ref no longer exists, or an anonymous remote is unreachable), the clone hook logs a warning, reports the
mount path in `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone`
`sandbox.operation.completed` event, and the session continues without it.
Without the flag a failed clone fails sandbox setup, as before. OpenGeni sets
it only on repositories it attaches on a person's behalf (a Slack task's
recently used repositories); it grants no access and changes no credential
routing. An optional clone is bounded to 60 seconds (90 seconds for all
optional clones of one setup command) when the sandbox has a `timeout` binary,
so a hung fetch is skipped the same way. Before each turn's strict GitHub App
allowlist recheck and installation-token mint, the worker also drops, for that
turn only, an optional GitHub App repository that the workspace allowlist no
longer admits or, when OpenGeni's own App mints the token (no host
`gitCredentials` port), that the installation can no longer reach; it reports
them as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on a `sandbox.operation.completed` event
named `optional-repository-access`. This only removes repositories from the
turn. A repository without the flag keeps the strict checks and still fails
the turn when its access is gone.

When upgrading existing sessions that omitted `mountPath`, the new default
materializes the repository at the host-aware location. A host that must retain
an existing warm workspace path should persist the session's former effective
`repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
case folding must be renamed. A repository whose name cannot itself be
used as a portable path segment (for example, a Windows-reserved device name)
can still be attached with a safe explicit `mountPath`.

Every request carries the current `sessionId`, root-session lineage,
turn/attempt/execution generation, frozen initiator, and immutable initiator
provenance. A host must authorize that authority against its own session binding
and selected repositories immediately before minting either a token or stable
Git identity. OpenGeni reuses the same frozen authority for initial provisioning,
deferred identity resolution, lazy provisioning, and proactive renewal; it fails
closed before calling a bound host broker when the authority is unavailable.

Legacy sessions with one binding for a provider retain the old request shape:
GitHub receives the authority plus `{ accountId, workspaceId, installationId, repositoryIds }`
with omitted `provider`; non-GitHub requests receive `provider` plus
`repositoryRefs`. An explicit binding, or multiple bindings for one provider,
adds `credentialBindingId`, `provider`, and (for a single canonical host)
`providerHost`. The host must echo those fields exactly in `GitCredentials`.
OpenGeni validates those echoes together with `workspaceId` before accepting a
token. Provider-neutral repository refs carry the same binding/access fields
plus `provider`, `repositoryId`, `installationId`, `projectId`, and
`connectionId`; GitHub aliases remain accepted. `expiresAt` is per binding;
without it OpenGeni uses a conservative bounded refresh cadence.

When the provider cannot mint a token whose authority is contained to those
selected repositories, the host may return `transport: { kind: "http_broker",
repositories }`. Every route must echo exactly one requested `repositoryUri`
and provide a unique, credential-free, canonical HTTPS `brokerUri`; the route
set must cover the binding exactly. `token` is then a short-lived bearer for the
host's smart-Git endpoint rather than a provider token. OpenGeni keeps the
persisted remote canonical and installs selected-remote Git `insteadOf` rewrites in a
replaceable include file. The path-aware helper supplies the bearer only to the
returned broker URI. It rejects missing, extra, duplicate, non-HTTPS,
credential-bearing, query-bearing, or fragment-bearing routes before sandbox
setup.

The worker never writes token values into the sandbox manifest or attach-time
environment delta. The runtime stores each token at
`OPENGENI_GIT_CREDENTIALS_DIR/<sha256(binding-id)>-token`, installs a Git
credential helper that selects by protocol + host + path with
`credential.useHttpPath`, and resets broader helpers so an unbound remote cannot
fall through to a sibling credential. Because that setup rewrites the executing
user's `$HOME/.opengeni` and global Git configuration, the generated scripts exit
without writing anything unless the runtime's sandbox lifecycle hook marks the
command with `OPENGENI_GIT_PROVISIONING_TARGET=sandbox`; running an exported
script builder directly on a host fails closed. Provider aliases (including
`OPENGENI_GIT_TOKEN_FILE`) are written only while that provider has exactly one
binding; they are removed when a second appears. `gh`, `glab`, and `az` select
an explicit `OPENGENI_GIT_BINDING`, then the current repository's `origin`, then
a sole direct-provider binding, and fail closed if selection remains ambiguous.
For a managed sandbox with multiple bindings for one provider, the model is told
to inspect the secret-free `$HOME/.opengeni/git-bindings.json` inventory. It maps
each opaque `credentialBindingId` to its provider, transport kind, repository URI,
and mount path, so an agent running outside a repository can deliberately set
`OPENGENI_GIT_BINDING` without guessing. The wrapper's ambiguity error points to
the same file. Connected Machines receive neither platform bindings nor this
instruction and continue using their own ambient Git authentication.
Broker bearers are never exported as provider tokens: a provider CLI selected
for a brokered binding fails with guidance to use the configured provider MCP
tools. Each binding renews independently, so one failed connection cannot block
or replace a healthy sibling token. Renewal may rotate a broker bearer but may
not change its exact routes during the admitted attempt; any route change fails
closed and waits for a newer turn. Renewal requires no model/MCP call and never
mutates the manifest.
`sandboxSecrets` receives the account/workspace/resource ids plus the exact
session/turn/attempt/execution generation, frozen turn initiator, and nullable
causal-human subject. Organization/workspace Variable Sets may be resolved for
a pure service initiator; user-scoped sets must reject a null causal human and
revalidate the exact admitted personal-resource grant. The provider returns
plaintext values plus exact scope/resource/attempt echoes, which the worker
checks before applying any value.

A standalone product can supply the same material without embedding: a
workspace credential provider ([`workspace-integrations.md`](workspace-integrations.md))
is a signed HTTP endpoint that OpenGeni uses as that workspace's `runCredentials`
resolver, in place of the injected port.

`runCredentials` is the session-aware seam for credentials that programs inside
the sandbox need: cloud CLI variables, kubeconfigs, provider configuration files,
or equivalent host-owned material. It is independent of `variableSetId`; the
request includes a variable-set id/name only as informational context. An
embedding host should resolve the OpenGeni session through its own durable
session binding instead of creating a marker variable set or copying host
connection rows into OpenGeni.

Every request carries account/workspace/session, parent and root session,
the shared `sandboxGroupId`,
turn/attempt/execution generation, frozen initiator and provenance, effective
sandbox backend and OS, and whether the call is initial provision or renewal.
The host decides which of its connections apply—including whether to deliver
anything to a connected machine—and returns provider-neutral environment
values, relative credential files, and environment names that point at those
files. One response may contain credentials for multiple providers and multiple
accounts; OpenGeni does not infer or constrain provider combinations.
`not_applicable` is the explicit per-attempt opt-out for a target OS/backend or
host policy; it carries no material and must remain stable for the frozen
attempt. On a compatible command surface OpenGeni still removes any prior
session credential root before agent or Channel-A commands run, so a worker
crash cannot leave an old pointer readable merely because the next attempt opts
out.

Run material is never added to the sandbox manifest or `/workspace`. The worker
validates scope echoes, paths, sizes, expiry, and reconnect metadata, then the
runtime writes an immutable generation under a session-specific `/tmp` root and
atomically replaces a small pointer file. Every new agent command and
session-scoped Channel-A terminal process sources that generation. Renewal is
single-flight and proactive; a stopped attempt rejects late host responses,
drains any physical write, and removes only its own generations before admitting
a successor or capturing the workspace. A successor's already-active generation
cannot be erased by stale cleanup; its initial provision also prunes orphaned
generations left by a worker crash after the prior attempt was fenced. Renewal
retains the active and immediately prior immutable generation, which gives an
already-running process one rotation of overlap while bounding disk growth;
processes do not receive live environment mutation and should restart or perform
their own provider refresh if they outlive rotating credentials.

Credential selection and renewal are pinned to the effective sandbox backend
and unproxied session established at turn start. If a user swaps the active route
mid-turn, OpenGeni does not copy that turn's host material onto the new target;
the next admitted turn resolves and seeds credentials for that target. This is a
deliberate authority boundary, especially when the new target is a connected
machine. A chat-only lazy turn still resolves the host port so reconnect state
and model context are deterministic even if no sandbox is ultimately created;
hosts should therefore keep resolution bounded, idempotent, and inexpensive.

`sandboxGroupId` is also a security fact, not bookkeeping. Sessions in one group
share an OS user and filesystem; separate session directory names prevent
accidental activation collisions but are not an isolation boundary. A host must
therefore select credentials that are valid for the whole shared-box trust
domain (commonly the intersection or root-session policy), decline delivery, or
place differently trusted sessions in separate sandbox groups. OpenGeni never
claims that `/tmp` path separation protects one same-user process from another.

OpenGeni does not register environment or credential-file values for output
rewriting. Accepted model, tool, event, history, failure, and diagnostic content
remains exact even when it contains configured-secret-shaped text. Hosts should
return only the materialization and renewal facts required by the run;
`auth_needed` can coexist with usable material and becomes both bounded model
context and a structured `credential.auth_needed` reconnect card.

The box-global websocket `ttyd` server remains credential-free because one box
may be shared by several sessions. Session-scoped terminal exec and PTY calls do
receive the active generation. A future websocket terminal implementation must
first isolate its server/process by session; pointing the current group-global
server at one session's credential root would be a cross-session leak.

Materialization uses a POSIX `bash` command surface. Base64 decoding is probed
across GNU, macOS, and OpenSSL variants, and every file's decoded byte count is
verified before activation. Pointer updates prefer
`flock(1)` and fall back to an atomic, stale-reaped directory lock so macOS does
not require an extra package. A host targeting a non-POSIX command surface (for
example native Windows without a compatible shell/toolset) must return
`not_applicable` for that attempt.

`mcpCredentials` is the request-time credential seam for connection-backed MCP
servers. Bind the same port through `activityDependencies` on the worker service
and `createApp(deps)`. The worker uses it for ordinary model-visible MCP calls;
the API router uses it for Codemode/Code Mode. When the leg is absent, both
surfaces use OpenGeni's standalone encrypted connection store and refresh broker.
When it is present, the host is the sole credential source: OpenGeni does not
create or require a duplicate provider connection.

Every request includes account/workspace scope, the immediate session and its
workspace-scoped `rootSessionId`, the exact durable turn and execution
generation, the immutable `TurnInitiator`, the non-authoritative technical
caller, the MCP server/tool, the opaque `connectionRef`, and whether a 401
forced a refresh. The same lineage is resolved for ordinary model tools and
Codemode, so a host can authorize a child through one durable root binding
without mirroring every child row. The frozen initiator—not `sandbox:<runId>`,
the session creator, or a synthetic worker subject—is the authorization
principal.

For provider-native developer tooling, `connectionRef.provider` identifies the
provider family, `providerDomain` identifies its host/tenant, `connectionId` is
the host's opaque binding identity, and `selectedResources` freezes the exact
repository ids the server may access. Multiple server entries may bind different
accounts for one provider or different providers in the same session. The
singular `resource` field remains the OAuth resource indicator; it is not a
repository selector.

OpenGeni-owned Connection refs omit `authoritySource` and remain subject to the
accepted-use snapshot and per-provider-request audit fence. An embedding host
that does not mirror its provider connection into OpenGeni sets
`authoritySource: "host"` beside its opaque `connectionId`; the id may use any
non-empty shape, including a UUID. With `mcpCredentials` bound, that explicit
provenance routes directly to the host resolver with the immutable turn lineage.
Without the host credential port, a host-owned ref fails closed as
`unsupported_auth` rather than falling through to OpenGeni's connection store.
For rolling upgrade compatibility, a bound host resolver also accepts legacy
refs that omit `authoritySource` only when their connection id is unambiguously
non-UUID. New host refs must set the marker, and UUID-shaped host ids require it.

Admission of explicit host authority is also behind
`OPENGENI_HOST_MCP_AUTHORITY_SOURCE_ADMISSION_ENABLED` (default `false`). Roll it out
in two phases: first deploy the supporting API, control worker, turn worker, and
web bundle everywhere with the flag false; after proving the old generation is
gone, set the flag true in a second rollout and only then admit or configure
`authoritySource: "host"` refs. The API rejects new explicit session/capability
refs while the flag is false and configured refs fail startup validation. Every
upgraded reader, inheritance path, and worker continues to preserve and execute
an already-stored marked ref regardless of its local flag value; the flag is not
an execution kill switch. The markerless non-UUID compatibility lane remains
available for pre-existing embedded sessions during phase one.

Once a marked ref has been persisted, do not restart an image from before this
contract. Setting the flag false stops new external marked writes but does not
rewrite, drain, or disable durable session/capability refs that already exist.
Remove those refs through ordinary forward operations before attempting any
pre-contract image rollback.

Successful results must echo account/workspace/immediate-session plus the exact
provider, provider domain, requested connection id, OAuth scopes/resource, and
selected-resource set. OpenGeni rejects a mismatched echo before any returned
header can reach the provider. Credential values never enter session events;
`auth_needed` carries only bounded connection metadata. A host that cannot
satisfy the configured endpoint's auth model returns `unsupported_auth`; one
that cannot enforce the selected repository set returns
`resource_scope_unavailable`. These reasons render as unavailable, not as a
duplicate OpenGeni reconnect flow, and a connection-backed optional MCP server
still degrades without breaking unrelated session tools.

Host-owned `tool.auth_needed` events use a rolling-safe public representation:
the legacy `reason` is pinned to `unsupported_auth`, while `hostReason`
retains the exact host result and `authorizationUrl` remains the host-minted
recovery target. A pre-contract browser therefore renders the notice as
unavailable and cannot send the opaque id into OpenGeni OAuth; an upgraded
browser reads `hostReason` and offers only the host URL. Successful host
credential results retain `authoritySource: "host"` through later provider 401,
403 `insufficient_scope`, and accepted-use revalidation failures so those
synthesized notices cannot lose provenance.

The standalone generic connection broker intentionally rejects a
`selectedResources` binding with `resource_scope_unavailable`: it can refresh a
connection token, but it has no provider-specific proof that the token or
adapter enforces those repositories. A standalone provider adapter must add that
proof before it may resolve the scoped binding.

The port is provider-neutral. A host can resolve its existing GitHub, GitLab,
Azure DevOps, or other connection from the opaque reference, and can return a
provider-supported token or a short-lived capability bearer for a compatible
host-owned adapter. OpenGeni does not imply that one provider's bearer works at
another provider's hosted MCP endpoint. Normal MCP and Codemode deliberately
share this resolver, so Code Mode is additive rather than a second connection or
authorization system.

Unset legs fall back independently to standalone self-mint/decrypt. `runCredentials`
has no standalone fallback because ordinary standalone sandbox credentials
continue to come from variable sets and existing lifecycle hooks. This port does
**not** supply the first-party MCP delegated token: `firstPartyMcpRequestInit` in
`packages/runtime/src/index.ts` self-mints the `ogd_` bearer with
`signDelegatedAccessToken(settings.delegationSecret, ...)`.

An embedded host can narrow a root session with
`CreateSessionRequest.firstPartyMcpPermissions`. Agent-created descendants
inherit the creating session's effective first-party permission set when
`session_create` omits an override; an explicit override must still be a subset
of the creating grant. This preserves a host's capability boundary across the
session tree while top-level omissions continue to use the deployment's normal
standalone worker defaults. The inherited set is frozen on the child at
creation; later deployment-default changes do not rewrite existing sessions.

Model-visible first-party tool selection is a separate field:
`CreateSessionRequest.firstPartyMcpTools`. It accepts only names from
`FIRST_PARTY_MCP_TOOL_NAMES`; omission uses the safe default catalog and excludes
connector-wide `social_*`, `slack_bot_*`, `fiken_*`, and `atlassian_*` tools, while explicit `[]` remains
empty. Connector tools require an explicit selection and their independent
connection permission. A child omission snapshots its parent's exact effective
selection. Tool selection never grants a permission, and permissions never
implicitly select a tool. This separation lets a host keep a broad delegated
authorization envelope while exposing only the tools appropriate to one
embedded session.

Resources are unaffected by that selection. File/document/repository
attachments still materialize when `firstPartyMcpTools` is empty or contains
only `set_session_title`; the dedicated `files` and `docs` MCP servers are
selected independently through `tools`. Omitted top-level `tools` policy keeps
Files enabled by default; an explicit list, including `[]`, is exact and can
disable it for embedded products that require a narrower model-visible surface.

### Child execution context

An agent-created child normally needs the same working context as its manager,
even when the two conversations are separate. When the creating grant carries
the worker-signed parent `sessionId`, `createSessionForRequest` treats omitted
`resources` (repositories only), `skills`, `tools`, and `mcpServers` as inheritance from that trusted immediate
parent. The snapshot preserves inline session skills, mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repository
resources, multiple credential bindings for one provider, selected MCP tool
refs, full per-session MCP policy, connection refs, and static credential
headers. Static header values move only as encrypted database ciphertext and
never enter a response, event, or core plaintext value.

The parent's session attachment keeps its existing overlay precedence if a
deployment or workspace capability with the same server ID was enabled after
the parent was created. Inheritance therefore does not silently switch the
child to a different endpoint merely because workspace configuration changed.

Each field remains independently caller-controlled. Supplying an explicit
array—including `[]`—replaces that field instead of inheriting it. If an explicit
MCP-server replacement makes an inherited strict tool ref invalid, the create
fails validation; replace `tools` in the same request rather than silently
dropping a strict tool. A top-level create has no parent snapshot: omitted
resources, skills, and MCP servers remain empty, while omitted tools continue to receive
workspace-default capability MCP refs. Variable sets, sandbox environments, model selection,
persona instructions, goals, and sandbox placement retain their own existing
resolution rules and are not part of this context snapshot.

There is deliberately no caller-supplied `parentSessionId`. Parent identity
comes only from the signed grant, is loaded inside the same workspace boundary,
and later receives the normal exact-attempt ownership check. Explicitly attaching
or replacing MCP servers still requires `mcp_servers:attach`; omission can copy
the parent's already-authorized servers without granting the child authority to
invent a new endpoint. Header-based credentials are snapshot values, so later
rotations on parent and child are independent. A `connectionRef` remains the
preferred host integration because normal model MCP and Codemode resolve fresh
transport credentials at request time.

### Credential-bearing outbound transport

Canonical sources: `@opengeni/network`, `@opengeni/runtime/mcp-network`, and
[`credentials.md`](credentials.md).

Standalone and embedded runtimes use the same fail-closed network boundary for
MCP and OAuth: one DNS resolution is policy-checked, the actual request is made
through an Undici Agent pinned to that answer, TLS still verifies the URL
hostname, response bodies are bounded, and redirects are handled manually so
each hop is independently validated. `prepareAgentTools` accepts
`mcpFetchImpl` for tests and embedded transport integration, but the injected
fetch remains behind `guardedMcpFetch` and must honor the supplied Undici
`dispatcher`; it is not a bypass for destination policy.

Private integration targets are denied by default. A self-hosted operator may
explicitly enable `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_TARGETS` for
trusted internal MCP/OAuth endpoints; local/test already has the narrow
loopback escape needed by fixtures. Keep credential resolution outside the
pinned final transport so headers are attached only to the exact request URL
that the broker audience-checks.

### Persistence

Canonical sources: `packages/db/src/index.ts`, `packages/db/src/migrate.ts`, `packages/db/src/provision-roles.ts`, and `dbSearchPath` in `packages/config/src/index.ts`.

Standalone uses `createDb(settings.databaseUrl)` and no search-path override. Embedded hosts can use:

- `runMigrations(adminConnection, targetSchema)` / `migrate(databaseUrl, schema)` to apply the SQL chain under a caller-selected schema.
- `provisionRoles(adminConnection, { targetSchema, rlsStrategy })` for app/Temporal role setup.
- `createDb(databaseUrl, { searchPath, rlsStrategy, userLookup, max })` for postgres-js handles.
- `registerDbBinding(db, { rlsStrategy, userLookup })` for an externally constructed Drizzle handle.

For `rlsStrategy: "force"`, role provisioning rejects every privilege-bearing
role relationship. PostgreSQL 16+ managed services may retain the automatic
ADMIN-only reverse grant from `opengeni_app` to the non-superuser `CREATEROLE`
principal that created it; OpenGeni accepts only the exact non-inheritable,
non-settable, superuser-granted management edge. PostgreSQL 15 and every
uncertain or privilege-bearing edge remain fail-closed.

Dedicated-schema deployments use a search path shaped like `<schema>,opengeni_private,public`; `public` stays last so pgcrypto/pgvector symbols resolve. `rlsStrategy: "force"` is the standalone posture: OpenGeni connects as a non-owner role and FORCE RLS applies. `rlsStrategy: "scoped"` is the embedded owner-role posture: the host owns the isolation boundary, but OpenGeni still emits the `opengeni.account_id` / `opengeni.workspace_id` GUCs on scoped queries.

### Worker

Canonical sources: `createOpenGeniWorkerService(options)`, `runOpenGeniWorker(options)`,
and the lower-level `createOpenGeniWorker(options)` in `apps/worker/src/index.ts`.

The worker is always a separate durable process for real agent turns. Run one
`control` role and one or more independently scalable `turn` roles. An embedded
host normally uses the full lifecycle wrapper:

```ts
await runOpenGeniWorker({
  role: "control", // use "turn" for the inference fleet
  settings,
  activityDependencies: {
    db: hostScopedDb,
    bus: sharedBrokerBus,
    connectionCredentials: hostCredentialPort,
  },
});
```

`runOpenGeniWorker` installs `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` drain handlers, exposes `/healthz`,
`/readyz`, and `/metrics`, registers engine-internal maintenance schedules on the
control role, and closes only the Temporal clients/listener it creates. It never
closes the injected database or EventBus; the host closes those after the worker
has drained. Pass `shutdownSignals: false` when a host process manager owns
signals, and use `createOpenGeniWorkerService` for explicit `run`, `drain`,
`state`, and `close` control. Set `internalSchedules: "none"` only when another
control worker in the same deployment owns the OpenGeni reaper, expired-upload,
and workflow-wake schedules. These are engine maintenance cadences; the
embedding host may continue to own all product-level scheduled-agent behavior.

The published package contains `dist/workflow-bundle.js`, generated by Temporal
from the exact package source during the same build. Installed control workers
load it through `WorkerOptions.workflowBundle`; a missing artifact fails startup.
Hosts must not copy raw workflow TypeScript out of `node_modules`. Source-tree
development keeps using `src/workflows.ts` so the local edit loop remains direct.
`workflowBundle` is an advanced explicit override for release systems that
provide an equivalently version-bound artifact.

Control and turn roles normally run as separate processes and may therefore use
the same configured HTTP port. A host constructing both roles inside one process
must disable one package listener with `http: false` and expose equivalent
lifecycle endpoints itself, or provide distinct per-process settings/ports.

`ActivityDependencies` can inject `settings`, `db`, `bus`, `runtime`,
`objectStorage`, `documentServices`, `observability`, workflow signalers,
`entitlements`, and `connectionCredentials`. The lifecycle API requires the
host-owned `db` and broker-backed `bus` so readiness and resource ownership are
unambiguous; the lower-level factory retains standalone defaults.

### Temporal transport

Canonical source: `temporalConnectionOptions(settings)` in
`packages/config/src/index.ts`. The API workflow client, worker native
connection, workflow signaler, and engine schedule clients all use this one
policy.

`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_HOST`, `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`, and
`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE` select the endpoint and logical queues. Set
`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_API_KEY` for Temporal Cloud; an API key enables TLS
automatically. Set `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_ENABLED=true` for server-auth TLS
without an API key. Custom deployments may additionally provide
`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_NAME`, a base64 root CA through
`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`, or the paired base64 mTLS
certificate/private-key variables. Any custom TLS material also enables TLS,
and an incomplete or malformed pair fails startup before a client connects.

These are deployment credentials, not host-user integration credentials. Keep
the API key and private key in the runtime secret consumed by both API and
worker processes; do not route them through `ConnectionCredentialsPort` or
write them into a sandbox.

### Durable host event and usage export

Canonical sources: the `HostEventSink` / `HostUsageSink` contracts in
`packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, the host-export repository API in
`packages/db/src/index.ts`, migrations `0097_host_export_outbox.sql` and
`0103_host_export_root_session.sql`, the immutable maintenance backfill in
`0104_host_export_root_session_backfill.sql`, the forward-only validation and
registration repair in `0107_host_export_lineage_contract.sql`, and
`createHostExportPump(options)` in `apps/worker/src/host-export-pump.ts`.

Accepted `user.message` events intentionally have no direct turn ID. Migration
`0460_host_export_message_attribution.sql` derives export initiator and origin
from the exact same-account/workspace/session turn whose `trigger_event_id`
references the message, after the accepting transaction commits its turn. It
never derives sender authority from payload fields or the session creator.
An unbound event stays unattributed. The event's own turn ID and the existing
immutable export rows/checkpoints are unchanged; downstream historical
attribution repair is a separate operator action. Analytics consumers must expose
unattributed coverage instead of equating missing identity with zero messages.

Migration `0533_turn_surface_analytics.sql` adds three content-free analytics
fields next to `origin`, each from a fixed list defined in
`packages/contracts/src/product-analytics.ts`: `surface` (the attributed turn's
entry surface, see [`run-lifecycle.md`](run-lifecycle.md)), `modelProvider` (the
provider family from the turn's accepted execution policy; operator-configured
registry providers export as `registry`), and, on `agent.toolCall.created` only,
`toolFamily` (an OpenGeni first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`,
or `custom`, so a tenant's own MCP host never leaves the database). The worker
stamps `toolFamily` on the event payload and the export trigger checks the wire
format again, exporting NULL for anything malformed. Usage facts carry `surface`
and `modelProvider` from their turn. The published claim function and its
root/codec sidecar keep their signatures: SQL consumers read the new columns
through `opengeni_host_export.host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars(kind,
consumer, lease)` in the same transaction as the claim, and `createHostExportPump`
sinks receive them on each `HostEventExport` / `HostUsageExport`. The fields are
optional on the wire; rows enqueued before the migration export them as null.


An embedded host can project OpenGeni's bounded durable session events and exact usage facts into
its own business store without polling tenant routes or treating NATS as a durable log. This surface
is optional. With no registered consumer, both export gates default to false and source transactions
write zero outbox rows, preserving standalone behavior. First-consumer registration and deferred
source capture lock the same configuration row, so their commit order is the enable boundary: a
source transaction ordered after registration cannot observe the old disabled state and skip export.

Provision the projection identity **after the first migration run**. It is deliberately not the
normal `opengeni_app` role: an exporter reads a cross-workspace stream, while the app role is
tenant-scoped. Provisioning grants the current API and registers same-owner default privileges;
shipped migrations also preserve existing exporter ACLs when adding an export function, so the
standard migration-only upgrade job does not strand a live exporter. Re-run provisioning if a
different database principal owns later custom functions. One OpenGeni installation per database
is supported: dedicated data schemas do not make the shared private/export function schemas
multi-installation-safe.

```ts
await provisionRoles(adminDatabaseUrl, {
  targetSchema: "opengeni",
  rlsStrategy: "force",
  appPassword,
  hostExportRole: "opengeni_host_exporter",
  hostExportPassword,
});

const exporter = createDb(hostExportDatabaseUrl, { max: 2 });
const pump = createHostExportPump({
  db: exporter.db,
  eventSink: {
    consumerId: "host-business-events",
    deliverEvents: async (batch) => hostStore.applyEvents(batch),
  },
  usageSink: {
    consumerId: "host-business-usage",
    deliverUsage: async (batch) => hostStore.applyUsage(batch),
  },
});
await pump.start();
```

The exporter role receives `USAGE` and function `EXECUTE` on the isolated
`opengeni_host_export` schema and no table privileges. The normal app role cannot register, claim,
rewind, prune, or inspect a host consumer. Each sink has a named checkpoint and one renewable batch
lease. Cursors are decimal strings so they remain exact past JavaScript's safe-integer range.

Delivery is **at least once**. If a process dies after the sink commits but before OpenGeni advances
the checkpoint, the identical idempotency keys are delivered again. A sink must transactionally
deduplicate those keys. Session ordering is authoritative by `event.sequence`; cursor order is
stable across sessions but deliberately not claimed to be causal. High-volume raw delta event types
are excluded from the host stream; their completed semantic events remain. Event types are bounded
but forward-tolerant so an older consumer can carry a newer writer's event during a rolling upgrade.
Canonical session events remain lossless. When one payload exceeds the bounded host wire, the
outbox carries a content-free truncation receipt keyed to the canonical event instead of blocking
the source transaction or copying an unbounded payload into the host stream.
Each session-bound event and usage fact also carries the immutable lineage `rootSessionId` captured
with the outbox row in the source transaction. A host can therefore retain the immediate child id
for audit while attributing usage or host-owned business signals to one root binding. Only a
sessionless fact has a `null` root. The rolling schema contract rejects a session-bound null and
fails validation on unexpected drift for explicit operator disposition; neither migrations nor
consumers guess lineage from mutable current data. Published migration `0104` remains an immutable
maintenance-class history entry: its legacy backfill used then-current session ancestry and cannot
universally prove source-transaction provenance. Forward migration `0107` never rewrites that
history or outbox data. It rejects a session-bound row that predates the `0103` ledger boundary (even
when `0104` populated a non-null root) until an operator performs a separate evidence-backed
maintenance disposition, while installations with no suspect population can apply `0107` through
the bounded rolling path. Child lifecycle remains child lifecycle—the root id is attribution
context, not permission to settle a root run.
Execution IDs on usage rows are validated soft references: deletion never rewrites the frozen fact.
The usage trigger locks the workspace before the session, turn, and attempt, matching lifecycle
writers. Rolling migration 0541 repairs this ordering without changing validation or retained facts.
Usage field limits are enforced only when the optional usage export is enabled; an unrepresentable
new fact fails its source transaction instead of committing a poison export row, while standalone
mode retains its prior input behavior.

Transient sink failures release the lease with exponential backoff and eventually block the named
consumer visibly instead of dropping rows. `resumeHostExportConsumer` is explicit. A genuinely
poisonous head record can be moved with `deadLetterHostExportHead`; only the exact leased head can be
disposed, so a bad record cannot skip an unseen prefix. Schema failures are counted and block like
sink failures; `HostExportPayloadError` reports the bounded head cursor needed for an explicit
operator disposition without copying its payload into logs. `rewindHostExportConsumer` rejects
pruned or future cursors. The pump runs bounded retention housekeeping after successful checkpoints;
`pruneHostExportOutbox` deletes only below every named consumer checkpoint and keeps the configured
grace window available for replay. A disabled consumer deliberately keeps that retention floor;
after quiescing it, `retireHostExportConsumer` (or `pump.retire(kind)` after `pump.stop()`) permanently
removes the checkpoint so the remaining consumers can advance retention. Re-registering a retired
name starts at the then-retained floor, not its former checkpoint; calling `pump.start()` again after
`pump.retire(kind)` performs exactly that explicit re-registration.

`pump.stop()` only drains the current sink call and stops polling; it intentionally keeps capture
enabled across deploy restarts. `pump.disable(kind)` retains that consumer and its checkpoint (so it
continues to hold the pruning floor); when it disables the last consumer of a kind, capture stops and
events in that interval are deliberately not recoverable. Normal deploys must use `stop()`, not
`disable()`.

#### Product lifecycle facts

Canonical sources: `PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE_FACT_ATTRIBUTES` in
`packages/contracts/src/product-lifecycle-facts.ts`, the `HostLifecycleFactExport` contract in
`packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, and migration `0532_product_lifecycle_fact_export.sql`.

A third export kind, `lifecycle_fact`, carries one content-free fact per person-level product
milestone, so a host can answer who signed up, verified, signed in, set up an organization, and
adopted which features without reading tenant data. Register it like the other kinds, either with
`registerHostExportConsumer(db, { kind: "lifecycle_fact", consumerId })` or with a
`lifecycleSink: { consumerId, deliverLifecycleFacts }` on `createHostExportPump`. Capture is off
until the first lifecycle consumer registers.

| Fact | Attribute (fixed list) | Captured when |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.sign_up` | method: `email`, `google`, `github`, `other` | a managed account gets its first sign-in method |
| `auth.email_verified` | none | the email is verified by link, or a social provider verified it at creation |
| `auth.sign_in` | method of that session | a live sign-in session is created (discarded session-set provider sessions are not) |
| `organization.setup` | `created`, `additional` | self-service setup or an additional organization commits |
| `model.connected` | `codex`, `supergrok`, `vercel_gateway`, `openrouter` | a subscription account or organization model provider is connected |
| `credits.purchased` | none | a credit top-up payment is granted |
| `connection.created` | provider class, for example `slack`, `github`, `google`, `other` | an integration connection is created |
| `scheduled_task.created` | none | a scheduled task is created |
| `skill.installed` | none | a catalog Skill is installed into a workspace |
| `slack.user_linked` | none | a Slack user is linked to an OpenGeni user |
| `machine.enrolled` | none | a new Connected Machine is enrolled |
| `member.joined` | none | a person becomes an active member of an organization that already had one |

Row triggers on the source tables write each fact in the same transaction as the product change,
so every writer path is covered and a rolled-back change leaves no fact. A capture error rolls back
only the fact and raises a database warning; it never fails the product change. A self-service
setup that fails writes nothing durable, so failed setups stay a count in
`opengeni_organization_setup_total{outcome="failed"}` rather than a per-person fact.

Facts are deliberately minimal. `fact.subjectId` is present only for opaque `user:` and `api_key:`
subjects; every other subject (services, embedded-host identities) is reduced to `subjectKind`. Sign-up,
verification and sign-in facts carry no organization (`accountId: null`), because a person can
belong to several. No name, email, IP address, user agent, provider domain, credential, amount, or
free text is exported: a connection to a domain outside the fixed provider list is exported as
`other`. Fact ids are deterministic, so a re-captured fact has the same `idempotencyKey`. Retention
of delivered facts belongs to the sink; the outbox keeps only undelivered and recently acknowledged
rows, like the other kinds.

### EventBus

Canonical sources: `EventBus` / `createNatsEventBus` in `packages/events/src/index.ts`, SSE in `apps/api/src/http/sse.ts`.

API and worker must share the same broker-backed EventBus binding. The production implementation is `createNatsEventBus(natsUrl, auth?)`; it handles session fanout, selfhosted request/reply, and agent events over one managed NATS connection. Postgres remains the durable event log, but live SSE depends on worker publishes reaching API subscribers cross-process.

Every supported binding must expose `sessionEventDurableFanout` version 1. Its `subscribeRecovery` callback fires with a monotonically increasing generation only after the local subscriber transport and subscriptions have recovered. Session SSE coalesces that signal into its serialized Postgres reconciliation tail, so messages accepted by the broker while this API instance was disconnected cannot strand an already-open client. The worker refuses to start or become ready without this capability, the API reports failed readiness and refuses a session SSE stream without it, and durable title fanout checks it before claiming an outbox row.

`subscribe` and `subscribeWorkspaceControl` accept an optional `{ onTerminated }`. A binding whose transport subscription can end while the consumer still holds it (for example a broker permissions violation) must call it once so session and workspace-control SSE fail retryably and the client reconnects and replays from Postgres, instead of receiving heartbeats and nothing else. A binding that never ends a held subscription may ignore it. The NATS binding also resubscribes its process-lifetime responders (auth callout, Codemode requests, agent-event ingestion) with bounded backoff and counts every unexpected end in `opengeni_nats_subscription_terminations_total{kind,recovery}`.

`publishConfirmed` remains optional for embedded brokers. When absent, the required `publish()` promise is the durable outbox acknowledgement and must resolve only after broker acceptance; failures must reject. This publish-only compatibility is supported only together with `sessionEventDurableFanout` v1. A formerly conforming custom bus that cannot notify subscriber recovery is intentionally no longer supported: add the capability before rolling this application version, rather than acknowledging publications that an API subscriber may have missed.

Do not replace this with an in-memory bus in an embedded deployment. In-memory fanout only reaches subscribers in the same process and would make worker -> API live SSE silently disappear; clients would only recover on replay/gap backfill.

For embedded UIs that page historical timelines, prefer `GET .../events?compact=1` (or SDK `listEvents(..., { compact: true })`) for windowed replay. It coalesces consecutive delta fragments in the page while preserving first-member `sequence`; use `payload.coalescedUntil` as the resume cursor for the live SSE stream. Streaming/gap backfill should keep using raw sequence replay.

## Host-owned product UI

Embedding does not require the host to copy its product model into OpenGeni.
The host may keep its own session header, repository/integration picker,
sharing controls, linked entities, billing presentation, and domain-specific
tabs while composing OpenGeni's session hooks and workbench surfaces below
them.

`@opengeni/react/session` is the headless composition boundary. Its baseline
`SessionClientLike` covers session events, composer, queue, control, and
approvals. Hooks outside that baseline export exact structural refinements:
`SessionReadClientLike`, `GoalClientLike`, `SessionLineageClientLike`, and
`FileAttachmentClientLike`. A host proxy therefore implements only the methods
used by the mounted hooks; it does not stub workspace administration, billing,
sandbox environment, connected-machine, or unrelated workbench APIs.

Generated-image timeline rows carry a compact permanent artifact receipt. A
host using the styled `MessageTimeline` can pass `loadRetainedArtifact`; the
stock web implementation calls the SDK's
`createRetainedArtifactDownloadUrl`, preserving the host's authenticated
workspace boundary while avoiding a full browser byte copy. A custom timeline
may instead call `downloadRetainedArtifact`, which verifies bounded ranges and
SHA-256. See [`image-generation.md`](image-generation.md).

Editable Office artifacts are likewise package-owned rather than web-owned.
The SDK exposes the durable artifact API and live protocol; React composes the
same editor used by the stock console. Agent tools and Codemode mutate that
same authorized head, and a persisted session association drives the Artifacts
dock. Import consumes a trusted ready workspace-file id; export returns a
verified workspace-file id. A host never receives a bucket, object key, signed
snapshot URL, or mutable kernel state. See
[`artifact-collaboration.md`](artifact-collaboration.md) and
[`artifact-engine.md`](artifact-engine.md).

Repository selection is also host-composable. `CreateSessionRequest.resources`
accepts the canonical provider-qualified `ResourceRef[]`, including several
providers, repositories, and credential bindings in one session. The stock web
picker is currently GitHub-oriented, but that is a stock-client limitation—not
an engine, API, or embedding restriction. Embedded hosts can retain their own
provider catalog and picker and submit the canonical resources once at launch.
OpenGeni then owns their runtime materialization and credential routing; the host
does not maintain a synchronized repository model.

The styled workbench is independently filterable. Hosts can mount Changes,
Files, and Terminal while omitting Desktop, or render a completely custom
timeline/composer from the session-only hooks and pure projection. Product
metadata should remain in host slots/components rather than being added to
OpenGeni contracts solely for one embedding.

`FileBrowser.isNodeVisible`, `SandboxFiles.isNodeVisible`, and
`SandboxWorkspace.isFileNodeVisible` provide a presentation-only file filter.
The default shows every node. A hidden directory hides its complete subtree;
selection and reveal requests for hidden paths are ignored. The predicate does
not grant or revoke filesystem authority. For example, a host can hide only
root dotfiles while preserving nested project dotfiles:

```tsx
<SandboxWorkspace
  {...props}
  isFileNodeVisible={(node, { depth }) => !(depth === 0 && node.name.startsWith("."))}
/>
```

## Trust model

The embed boundary has a deliberate split of authority. Getting this wrong in
either direction creates real vulnerabilities (too little host gating) or
pointless coupling (host ownership of engine internals), so it is a contract:

**The host owns the perimeter and external identity.**

- Every request reaching the mounted api-router has already passed the HOST's
  authentication. OpenGeni's own checks (delegated tokens, API keys) are the
  second gate, not the first — an embedded deployment must never be reachable
  except through the host's front door.
- The host decides which of its principals maps to which OpenGeni
  account/workspace, and mints `ogd_` delegated tokens (with the deployment's
  delegation secret) to act as them. Admission policy that depends on the
  host's business state (plans, quotas, feature gates) enters through the
  entitlements port on the worker side.

**The engine owns its internal plumbing tokens.**

- First-party MCP delegated tokens, stream tokens, and NATS credentials are
  self-minted by the engine with its own secrets. They never leave the engine's
  trust domain (the host's process and infrastructure), so routing them through
  a host token issuer would add coupling without adding security. Do not expect
  a port for these; there isn't one on purpose.
- Corollary for hosts: protect the engine's secrets (delegation secret,
  encryption keys) exactly like your own signing keys — inside the engine's
  trust domain they are root authority.

**API-side admission is local by design.** The API validates structure,
permissions, and workspace scoping; host-specific admission (may this tenant
run another turn?) is enforced where the work actually starts — the worker's
entitlements port. A request can therefore be _accepted_ by the API and still
be _declined_ at run admission; hosts that want earlier rejection should gate
at their own perimeter, which they control.
