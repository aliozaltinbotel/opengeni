# Image generation

Image generation is a provider-aware agent tool with one provider-neutral
artifact contract. Providers create pixels; Opengeni owns durable operation
admission, validation, storage, model-history projection, sandbox
materialization, API retrieval, and timeline rendering.

Canonical sources:

- tool contract: `packages/contracts/src/image-generation.ts`
- provider selection and turn integration:
  `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/agent-build.ts`
- media validation, retention, and model projections:
  `apps/worker/src/activities/generated-images.ts`
- adapter operation fence:
  `apps/worker/src/activities/image-generation-operation.ts`
- bounded provider wire decoding: `packages/network/src/json-base64.ts`
- database authority: `packages/db/src/generated-images.ts` and migration
  `0187_generated_image_artifacts.sql`
- public retrieval: `apps/api/src/routes/files.ts`,
  `packages/sdk/src/retained-artifacts.ts`, and the React timeline registry

## Provider selection

Selection is deterministic for the accepted turn:

1. A first-party, direct OpenAI Responses turn whose selected text model
   explicitly declares hosted image generation uses the native
   `image_generation` tool with `gpt-image-2`. A custom OpenAI-compatible base
   URL and unknown model capability both fail closed.
2. A connected Codex subscription uses its account-scoped image endpoint with
   `gpt-image-2` through a client-executed function tool.
3. Other model routes may use the workspace-owned Vercel AI Gateway credential
   through the pinned Gateway image-model protocol;
   `OPENGENI_IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL` selects that image model and defaults to
   `openai/gpt-image-2`.

The ordinary text model and image model are intentionally independent. The
tool is omitted unless permanent object storage and one verified route above
are available. Adapter-backed generation accepts one bounded text prompt and
up to four ordered PNG, JPEG, or WebP references. A reference may be an exact
`/workspace` path, a workspace File ID, or a generated-image artifact ID. The
worker resolves workspace ownership, range-reads bounded bytes, validates the
actual image signature and durable hash, then sends those images in order.
Arbitrary URLs are never accepted. The prompt states what each ordered image
contributes. Masks and provider-specific edit controls are not emulated.
Resolving a `/workspace` reference joins the shared canonical turn-sandbox
access boundary at the point of the file read. File and generated-image
artifact references read permanent object-storage bytes and do not create or
resume a sandbox.

Codex subscriptions use `/images/generations` without references and the
Codex-compatible `/images/edits` request when references are present. Gateway
uses the pinned v3 image model `files` input. The no-reference request and
durable operation digest remain byte-for-byte compatible with earlier turns.

The selected text provider does not change the generated-image artifact or UI
contract. Current route availability is:

| Text-model route | Generation transport | Existing image/view input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct reviewed OpenAI Responses | Native hosted tool | Typed Responses image input |
| Connected Codex subscription | Codex image adapter | Typed function-image results |
| Connected SuperGrok/xAI subscription | Native hosted xAI image tool | Typed Responses image input |
| Managed or workspace Gateway Responses | Workspace Gateway image adapter | Typed image input only for catalogued vision models (Kimi K3 yes; DeepSeek V4 Flash no) |
| Other registry Responses providers | Workspace Gateway image adapter | Typed image input only when the model declares it |
| Registry Chat providers | Workspace Gateway image adapter | Disabled until Opengeni has a proven typed Chat image wire |

“Workspace Gateway image adapter” requires that workspace's Gateway key; the
managed Opengeni text-model credential is not reused for separately billed
image generation. Text-only models can still create images through the adapter,
but never receive pixel-bearing `view_image` or computer tools.

## Durable operation and artifact boundary

Adapter-backed generation is a paid, side-effecting operation. Before calling
the provider, the worker prepares one stable `image_generation_operations` row
keyed by workspace, logical turn, and tool-call identity, then advances it to
`provider_started`. If the exact Codex lease fence rejects before the first
provider request, the operation returns to `prepared` and remains retryable;
the retry may safely rebind that prepared row to the selected failover
credential and its derived artifact identity. The request, provider, and model
identity remain immutable, and no binding may change after provider admission.
Once a provider request has been admitted, a crash or ambiguous error remains
`outcome_unknown`; a recovery may complete a deterministic object upload that
already exists, but never repeats an admitted provider call.

Native hosted generation remains part of the provider model call and therefore
inherits the existing single-in-flight-model-step crash boundary. Its provider
item id, provider binding, and workspace identify the retained artifact.

Successful bytes are signature-, dimension-, size-, MIME-, and SHA-256-checked
before they become a permanent workspace `files` row. The
`generated_image_artifacts` row records only bounded correlation and exact
media facts. Object keys, credentials, signed URLs, and base64 never enter the
receipt. A ready receipt is immutable and retrieves through the existing
workspace artifact/file authority.

JSON/base64 provider responses are decoded incrementally into one bounded byte
buffer. Opengeni never retains the full JSON envelope or encoded image string,
and provider adapters never retry an outcome-ambiguous paid request.

## Conversation and prompt-cache invariants

Generated pixels are artifacts, not conversation memory.

- Native base64 is retained before any event/history serialization and is
  replaced durably by one closed `generated_image` receipt.
- Function adapters return that same compact receipt directly.
- Every later model request projects a retained native hosted item to one
  deterministic assistant fact containing only artifact id, sandbox path, MIME,
  and dimensions. Adapter history remains its provider-neutral `generate_image`
  call plus the same compact receipt. Neither path receives a signed URL,
  provider item id, object key, or historical base64.
- A requires-action `RunState` stores the compact receipt. Its SDK-resume view
  temporarily projects the native hosted item to the same assistant fact;
  durable state is not rewritten during resume.
- These request-local projections preserve canonical item order and are stable
  for an unchanged history prefix.

## Sandbox and browser delivery

After retention, the worker materializes the exact file at
`/workspace/generated-images/generated-image-<artifact-id>.<ext>` when the
creating turn has a sandbox (cwd-relative `generated-images/...` in
model-facing facts, because Connected Machines have no `/workspace` directory).
The object write is already durable, so a transient
sandbox copy failure cannot replay generation. Later turns keep the receipt and
do not eagerly inspect or restore historical images; an agent that needs the
bytes retrieves the permanent workspace file explicitly.

Browsers receive only the compact receipt in the timeline. The SDK validates
its closed shape and either verifies bounded range downloads or mints a
short-lived file download URL. The stock React renderer uses the signed URL so
multi-megabyte images do not make a second full JavaScript byte copy.

Filesystem `view_image` and computer screenshots use the separate
session-retained-image lifecycle. PNG, JPEG, and WebP are signature-validated,
stored without inline base64, and rendered through authenticated artifact
retrieval. Other SDK-recognized image formats are not promoted to that durable
contract; they remain unsupported rather than being silently transcoded or sent
to providers whose accepted MIME set is unknown.
