# Event-triggered automations

Opengeni automations translate authenticated external events into ordinary agent sessions. Pull-request review is an adapter built on this substrate, not a separate execution engine.

## Model

- A **source** owns an adapter, an opaque public webhook endpoint, non-secret adapter configuration, an encrypted ingress secret, an active/disabled lifecycle, and a monotonic version. PR Review sources are managed only through the PR Review setup API.
- A **trigger** points at one source. Its immutable revisions own event matching plus the complete session template. `configuration` is adapter policy, while bounded `parameters` hold values such as an exact repository binding. A mutable head selects the current revision and active/paused/disabled status.
- An **event** is the normalized, bounded result of one authenticated provider delivery. It freezes the accepted source version/configuration and matched trigger revisions, so recovery never resamples newer configuration. `(source, delivery key)` deduplicates transport retries and the raw-byte digest rejects a reused delivery identity with different bytes. One event may match at most 32 triggers.
- A **run** is one trigger accepting one logical occurrence. `(trigger, occurrence key)` converges distinct provider deliveries for the same work. It freezes the exact accepted execution and later links to one ordinary session.

The provider delivery ID is never a session ID. The run ID owns session-create idempotency, fixing providers that redeliver the same logical occurrence under new delivery IDs.

## Trust and authority

The public endpoint contains only a random routing UUID. The route resolves that UUID through the credential-free `automation_webhook_endpoints` table, then loads the FORCE-RLS source and authenticates the bounded raw request before parsing it. Adapter payload data is untrusted model input, not instruction or permission authority.

Ingress authentication and agent action credentials are separate authorities. The generic substrate stores only the source's webhook verification secret. Provider adapters own their action-credential bindings and must mint the narrow, short-lived credential for the exact run/session at use time; event payloads never supply credentials or permission grants.

Dispatch is a bounded Temporal control workflow. Immediately before the session shell and run linkage commit together, it rechecks:

- source is active and its version still matches the accepted event;
- trigger is active and its current revision still matches;
- the accepted execution matches the run's account, workspace, source, trigger, revision, and event.

A revoked or changed authority skips the run. A transient dispatch failure is retryable and reuses `automation-run:<run id>` for session-create idempotency. The actual agent turn remains owned by the ordinary session workflow and its non-retryable turn activity.

Automations cannot select `selfhosted` compute because no interactive machine owner is present. Model policy, billing admission, usage recording, session tool policy, sandbox policy, and all normal turn controls continue to apply.

### Empty first-party authority

Automation session templates default both `firstPartyMcpTools` and
`firstPartyMcpPermissions` to `[]`. The resulting empty permission ceiling means
no delegated Opengeni tool authority, not inheritance of ordinary session
defaults; explicitly setting both arrays to `[]` preserves that behavior.
Keep these arrays empty for product-only jobs; do not add `sessions:read` or
another permission just to let a turn start.

This automation-template boundary differs from public `createSession`:
the latter still rejects `firstPartyMcpPermissions: []` with 422, including
SDK `asService` calls. Omitting that public field preserves existing default
or inherited permissions, not zero authority; `firstPartyMcpTools: []` alone
narrows model visibility, not the permission ceiling.

With an effective permission ceiling of `[]`, tool preparation skips remote
OpenGeni-delegated MCP servers before token signing, connection, or catalog
discovery, including eager and deferred startup. The broad `opengeni` server
with an empty tool selection is intentionally silent. Requested first-party
tools, or dedicated first-party `files`/`docs` servers, remain absent from the
executable catalog and publish the existing `insufficient_scope` auth-needed
advisory; they do not acquire fallback authority. Delegated tokens still require
at least one permission. Nonempty ceilings and ordinary sessions with undefined
permissions retain their existing behavior.

This skips only the existing first-party URL/id matches that use Opengeni's
delegated bearer. External-host MCP servers (even named `opengeni`, `files`, or
`docs`), host-owned local registrations, independently authorized
`connectionRef` servers, and already-authorized native runtime mechanics keep
their own authorization paths. Empty first-party permissions do not grant or
revoke those independent authorities. A linked-identity ceiling narrowed to
`[]` has the same zero-authority behavior.

## Generic signed JSON adapter

`signed-json.v1` accepts events without provider-specific setup. It accepts a strict JSON object with `type`, optional `id`/`occurrenceKey`/time/subject/resource, and a `data` object. Send:

- `x-opengeni-signature-256: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of exact raw body>`
- optional `x-opengeni-delivery-id`; otherwise the authenticated raw request digest is the delivery identity

Workspace admins manage sources and triggers under `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/automations/...`. Manual event injection uses the authenticated source event endpoint. External systems post only to `/v1/webhooks/automations/:endpointId`.

## PR Review setup authority

The fixed `source-control.pull-request.v1` adapter is reserved for PR Review.
Generic source and trigger mutation APIs reject this adapter; the PR Review
setup API owns credential rotation, repository bindings, configuration, and
lifecycle synchronization. See [PR Review](pr-review.md).
