/**
 * In-process circuit breaker for Jev. Consecutive JevUnavailableError failures open it for a cooldown, so a
 * Jev outage costs one fast refusal per call instead of a full retry cycle. After the cooldown the breaker is
 * half-open and tryAcquire() admits exactly one trial call at a time.
 *
 * Every admitted call gets a lease and settles it exactly once:
 * - recordSuccess(lease) from any call closes the breaker, because any success proves Jev works.
 * - recordFailure(unavailable, now, lease) from any call counts, and reopens a half-open breaker at once.
 * - release(lease) (the call never reached Jev) or recordFailure with another error (a rejected request, a
 *   workspace failure, an abort) neither counts nor resets the streak. It ends the trial only when that
 *   lease is the trial, so a call admitted while closed cannot free the slot of a trial running now.
 * isOpen() and status() are for metrics and diagnostics. Do not use them to decide which tools a turn is
 * offered: that list is part of the model's cached prompt prefix and must not change with transient health.
 * The worker keeps one breaker per process.
