//! The seq-addressed retention log: what an op keeps so a re-attaching
//! consumer can replay everything it has not yet acknowledged.
//!
//! Two frontiers govern an op's bytes (PROTOCOL.md ruling M2):
//!
//! * **Send-credit** (owned by [`crate::flow`]) bounds what is sent ahead of
//!   acks while a consumer is attached.
//! * **Retention** (this module) bounds what is KEPT for replay: while no
//!   consumer is attached the op keeps draining its child into this log —
//!   memory first, spilling to a disk spool — so a build keeps running through
//!   a connection blip; when memory + spool quotas are exhausted the append
//!   fails TYPED and the op is failed explicitly (never silent truncation).
//!
//! The log is strictly seq-ordered: frames are appended with consecutive
//! sequence numbers, freed only by a cumulative ack floor, and replayed as a
//! contiguous range. Once a log spills to disk it stays disk-backed for the
//! rest of the op (ops are finite; mode ping-pong is complexity with no
//! payoff). Spool segments are dropped whole once fully acked.
//!
//! Nothing here reads clocks or spawns tasks; disk I/O is plain `std::fs`
//! against a caller-provided directory. The shared [`GlobalSpoolBudget`] is
//! charged only when bytes actually spill to disk, never from a command's
//! theoretical maximum (PROTOCOL.md ruling M2 "global byte budget").
