# @opengeni/contracts

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 01f50bf: Add a public, content-free `POST /v1/analytics-consent` beacon that counts
  answers to the web console's optional-analytics banner in
  `opengeni_analytics_consent_total{decision}` (refusals in
  `opengeni_analytics_consent_reports_rejected_total{reason}`), with a streamed
  128-byte body limit, a same-deployment `Origin` check and per-decision
  admission bounds, so product reports can state how much of the audience
  consent-gated analytics never sees. The wire grammar (path, closed `granted` /
  `denied` decision list, and body size limit) is exported from
  `@opengeni/contracts/analytics-consent-report`.
- 3f9c757: Bad client input no longer answers `500`. A request body that fails its schema
  is `400 validation_failed` naming each offending field (malformed JSON too); a
  server-side projection failure stays `500`. An unknown `/v1` method or path
  answers `405` (with `Allow`) or `404` before authentication, instead of the
  retryable `503` the session authorization layer used to return (for example
  `GET .../sessions/:id/tool-policy`). `PATCH /v1/workspaces/:id` with `settings`
  points at `PATCH /v1/workspaces/:id/settings`, and an Integration install whose
  `allowedTools` names a preview `operationKey` (or any unknown value) is a `422`
  listing the valid tool ids and the id each operationKey maps to.
  `PUT /v1/workspaces/external` (`ensureWorkspace`) accepts an omitted
  `accountId` from an organization API key, which creates the workspace in the
  key's own organization; every other caller must still send it.
- aad6598: Claude subscription setup and replacement require only the setup token. Observe
  provider usage and reset windows from ordinary model responses, including quota
  errors, and expose scoped cached reads and authorized refreshes. Preserve the last
  reading when inference-only tokens cannot use the separate usage endpoint; fence
  cached readings against credential replacement and revocation.
- 3f9c757: An organization service key can change an existing external member's
  permissions in one shared workspace without removing and re-adding them:
  `PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/workspaces/:workspaceId/external-members/:membershipId`
  (`updateExternalWorkspaceMember` in the SDK) with `{ operationId, permissions }`.
  It is keyed and idempotent like a grant, capped by the key's permissions, and
  never cancels or tears down work. Narrowing also advances the member's
  organization authorization revision so frozen authority re-checks on next use.
  Rolling migration 0540 adds the `update` action to the external membership
  operation ledger.
- 9732749: Knowledge saves can omit `entryId` when creating an entry. OpenGeni derives the id from `operationId`, so an exact retry replays the same entry instead of creating a duplicate. The all-zero UUID is rejected. A create whose `entryId` belongs to another entry now fails with a clear "entry id taken" error (HTTP 409, `knowledge_entry_id_taken`). Previously this was reported as operation-ID reuse, so agents retried forever and the fact was never saved.
- a82657f: Register signed credential providers and webhooks once per organization with explicit external-source filters and workspace overrides, excluding Personal workspaces. Include authorized initiating-human identity, registration lane, workspace routing and selected remote targets. Bind renewable MCP headers to normalized URLs only, restrict transport headers, skip unavailable targets and fail closed on expiry. Add immediate signing-secret rotation and canonical browser/organization-key administration. Server-only organization helpers, individual webhook reads, and secret rotation are opt-in functions from `@opengeni/sdk/workspace-integrations`, taking `client` first rather than expanding the eager browser client.
- cabfc5e: Organization usage summaries now list each member's Personal workspace as a
  usage-only row (`personalWorkspaces`, keyed by the owner's organization
  membership, plus `personalWorkspaceCount`). Rows carry amounts only - never the
  Personal workspace id, name, sessions or content - and follow the same
  actor-visible session rule as the period totals, which already counted this
  usage. Rolling migration 0543 replaces the aggregate with the same signature and
  ACL, so older API processes keep working and ignore the new fields, which
  default to empty.
- 8669490: Add per-person product lifecycle facts to the durable host export as a third kind, `lifecycle_fact`. Migration `0532_product_lifecycle_fact_export.sql` (rolling) captures one content-free fact per sign-up, email verification, sign-in, organization setup, model connection, credit top-up, connection, scheduled task, installed catalog Skill, Slack user link, enrolled machine and organization join, in the same transaction as the product change. Nothing is captured until a host registers a `lifecycle_fact` consumer, and a capture failure never fails the product change.

  Every fact is a fixed type with an optional value from a fixed per-type list (`PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE_FACT_ATTRIBUTES`), a subject kind, the opaque `user:`/`api_key:` subject id when there is one, and the organization and workspace UUIDs when the product change has them. Sign-up, verification and sign-in facts carry no organization. `claimHostExportBatch` accepts `kind: "lifecycle_fact"` and returns a `HostLifecycleFactExportBatch`; `createHostExportPump` accepts an optional `lifecycleSink`.

- 3f9c757: A scheduled occurrence the scheduler refuses before running it is now a visible
  run instead of a thrown, retried activity or a silently dropped occurrence.
  `ScheduledTaskRun.admissionRefusal` (`{ version, reason, retryable }`, with
  `error` equal to `reason`) covers unprovable authority, an unavailable
  Connected Machine target, a missing Variable Set, a Sandbox Environment without
  an active version (terminal, status `failed`), and an inactive machine
  enrollment, insufficient credits or monthly limits (transient, status
  `skipped`; later occurrences run normally). Redelivery never adds a second run.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled run whose turn waits for a tool approval or a structured question
  is now visible: `ScheduledTaskRun.awaitingHuman` (`{ since, expiresAt }`) on run
  listings and `awaitingHuman` on the scheduled-task attention list, instead of the
  run looking merely "dispatched". The new optional
  `agentConfig.approvalTimeoutSeconds` (60 s to 30 days; default none) lets the
  scheduler reject the pending approval (or skip the question) as a labelled
  system decision once nobody answered in time, driven by a durable workflow
  timer.
- f986809: Scheduled tasks can post to one Slack channel as the OpenGeni workspace bot. A person chooses the channel in the schedule editor ("Post to Slack" under Advanced), stored as `agentConfig.slackBotChannelId` next to `slackBotConnectionId`. Choosing or changing it needs a signed-in person with `connections:write`, and the bot must be a member of an active channel that is not shared with another organization. Agents, services and API keys cannot set or change it. `listScheduledTaskSlackChannels` in the SDK lists the eligible channels.

  Runs of such a task get two tools, `slack_bot_prepare_message` and `slack_bot_send_prepared_message`, which take no channel. Prepare saves the exact text; send posts it to the task's channel with the saved server-owned id as the Slack post operation id, so a retried send never posts twice. Both re-read the task at every call, so clearing or changing the channel takes effect immediately and never redirects an already prepared message. Rolling migration 0530 adds the private prepared-message table and its two capabilities.

- 1ea4c69: Show when a scheduled task's frozen access is out of date, let its owner refresh it, and tell the owner when a run could not use a connector.

  For the task owner (or, for a task without an owner, people who manage schedules), scheduled task reads include a read-only `policyDrift`: workspace default connectors the task lacks, connectors the workspace no longer sets up, default OpenGeni tools missing from an agent-created task's frozen creator policy, connectors whose chosen account can no longer be used, and connectors with no account although one is now available. `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/scheduled-tasks/:taskId/refresh-access` (SDK `refreshScheduledTaskAccess`) re-freezes exactly that with the calling person's current authority through the ordinary owner update path. Only a signed-in person may call it; API keys, services, delegated bearers and agents cannot, a changed task returns 409, and a refreshed creator policy keeps a frozen permission only while that person holds it, adds only the permissions its newly added tools need (within the default worker set and that person's grant), and never changes the creator session policy.

  Scheduled runs whose own turn recorded `tool.auth_needed` carry `accessFailures`, and `GET .../scheduled-tasks/attention` (SDK `listScheduledTaskAccessAttention`) lists schedules whose latest run failed that way until a later run succeeds. It also lists schedules the scheduler refuses before creating a run because a chosen connector account can no longer be used (`unavailableAccounts`, with a null `runId` and `firedAt`), checked at read time with the same account plan as the drift; each item carries the task's `executionDigest`. The web console shows a dot on the Schedules navigation item, a badge on the schedule's row, a notice on the schedule's page with a one-click refresh, and the failure on each run row.

  The refresh accepts an optional `leaveOut` naming default connectors and OpenGeni tools to keep off the schedule; it only narrows what the refresh adds. The schedule page's "Keep without these" hides those defaults in that browser for the reviewed task head and passes them as `leaveOut` when the owner refreshes.

  `@opengeni/contracts` exports `ScheduledTaskPolicyDrift`, `ScheduledTaskAccessConnector`, `ScheduledTaskRunAccessFailure`, `ScheduledTaskAccessAttention`, `ListScheduledTaskAccessAttentionResponse`, and `RefreshScheduledTaskAccessRequest`; `ToolAuthNeededReason` is unchanged but now declared earlier in the module. `@opengeni/db` adds `listScheduledTaskCreatorPolicies`, `listScheduledTaskRunAuthNeededEvents`, `listScheduledTaskAccessAttentionEvents`, `listActiveScheduledTasksWithConnectionAccounts`, and `ScheduledTaskHeadChangedError`, and `updateScheduledTask` accepts `expectedExecutionDigest` and `creatorFirstPartyPolicy`.

- 30414a0: Add the first-party `session_set_model` MCP tool for changing an existing session's future model and reasoning defaults without waking it or rewriting accepted work. Preserve ordinary target authorization and exact-attempt fencing, provide stable idempotent receipts across reconnects, and report canonical model, reasoning and latency settings in full session readback. Share effective defaults across prompt admission, goal continuation, compaction and scheduled snapshots so older queued or resumed turns cannot undo an explicit choice. Deploy API and workers from a matched source cohort before using the new operation.
- 514f8ea: Count Skill reads and record a content-free Skill-use fact on each model `skill_read` event. The worker increments `opengeni_skill_reads_total{source, skill, kind, caller}`, where `skill` is a built-in id or `custom`, so tenant Skill ids, names, and requested identifiers never become labels. A successful model read also carries `_meta["opengeni/skillUse"]` (resolved id and source, ledger revision or whole-artifact digest, result kind, returned bytes, whether the Skill was in this turn's model-visible index, and whether `skill_search` returned it earlier in the attempt). MCP `_meta` never reaches the model, so the model-visible result and model history stay byte-identical; only the `agent.toolCall.output` event projection keeps the fact. Codemode results never carry it, and it is dropped rather than let a result cross the 1 MiB model-visible cap. `@opengeni/contracts` exports `SkillUse`, `SkillUseSource`, `SkillReadKind`, `SKILL_USE_META_KEY`, and `skillUseFromToolOutput` (the writer schema is closed; the reader drops fields a newer writer adds instead of the whole fact); `@opengeni/runtime` exports `skillCatalogEntryIds` and `modelToolResultFits`.
- 14990d0: A task started from Slack now starts from what the workspace offers every new session instead of the person's last website composer selection. Connectors follow the workspace default connector policy (including the person's own personal connections when that policy includes connected servers, still executable only through the frozen delegation snapshot), OpenGeni tools follow the workspace default selection, and the Sandbox Environment and its Variable Sets follow the workspace default. Only an explicitly chosen model carries over. Mentions, commands, DMs and shortcuts now always add the read-only Slack context tools, including when the workspace has its own default OpenGeni tool selection; reactions still do not.

  Repositories are the person's own recently used repositories in that workspace: those on the top-level sessions they started there in the last 30 days, most recent first, at most five, and only through their current entry in the workspace GitHub App catalog (same catalog and `github:use` permission as the website picker), on the default branch. Archived and empty repositories are skipped. A person with no recent repositories gets none; GitHub is asked only when there is something to look up, and an outage starts the task without repositories. These repositories are attached best effort.

  Repository resources gain an optional `optional: true` flag (contracts and SDK). A failed clone of such a repository logs a warning, is reported as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone` operation event, and no longer fails sandbox setup; a repository without the flag keeps the strict behavior. `GitHubRepository` gains optional `archived` and `sizeKb`, filled from GitHub when reported.

  The Slack acknowledgement adds one line naming what the task started with, for example `Using connectors: Gmail, Linear; repos: opengeni.` It names only connectors the first accepted turn can reach, so a personal-only connector the person never connected is not claimed. The line is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0529 adds the nullable `slack_interactions.session_defaults_line`), so a repaired acknowledgement re-renders identical bytes. A Slack message or a reacted-to message that links a workspace or session on a different deployment under the same parent domain (for example staging versus production) now carries a model-context note, so the agent says the link is for the other deployment instead of reporting the session as not found.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/core` removes `getActorNewSessionDefaults`. Use `getActorNewSessionModelChoice`, which returns only an explicitly chosen model policy. `@opengeni/db` adds `SlackInteraction.sessionDefaultsLine`, an optional `sessionDefaultsLine` input to `bindSlackInteractionSession` (written only by the bind that wins), `listRecentSessionRepositoryResources`, and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`.

- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- 872391f: Accept native browser bridge base64url generation IDs unchanged, including leading hyphens and underscores, so healthy Chrome profiles remain discoverable. Repair extension reconnection after handshake timeout or rejected readiness, and ignore stale port callbacks.
- 6146167: `code_search` never searches or returns platform credential material. `.opengeni/` (Codemode tokens, Git credential files and bindings), `.azure/` (the Azure CLI login cache) and `.config/opengeni/` (Connected Machine enrollment credentials) are excluded at any depth from every ripgrep call, and an explicit path into one of them, in any spelling or through a symlink, is ignored.
- 6f28afd: A definitively lost managed Modal sandbox no longer dead-ends its sessions. Shared sandbox groups (a parent with its children) now get the automatic checkpoint fallback, and every member receives the durable filesystem-discontinuity warning. When no checkpoint can be restored automatically (no archive, an unverified or legacy archive, an invalid artifact, or a definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure of the selected checkpoint), the whole quiescent group continues on a new empty workspace after a separate audited decision that warns every member the previous files are not available. Loss must be proven by a loss transition (a failed replacement box never counts), the empty workspace waits until the lost box is past its hard provider lifetime, other restore failures (including a missing archive object, now `archive_object_missing`, or unconfigured archive storage, now `archive_storage_unavailable`) retry the checkpoint with backoff and then wait for an operator, and a complete archive is never bypassed. Ambiguous provider states and live writers in any member still block, unknown command outcomes are never replayed, and the lost archive evidence is kept. Sessions stuck before this release recover on their next turn or Retry. The recovery projection adds `automaticLane` (`checkpoint` or `fresh_workspace`) and, for a timed wait, `availableAt` (when a Retry or a new message can decide again), and the failed-session banner says what Retry will do and when. Rolling migration 0548 requires warning protocol v3 to claim a session with an empty-workspace receipt.
- a6854a7: Allow completed turn owners to reach bounded Modal deadline capture without an interruption-only quiescence receipt. When the provider is definitively gone, select only a verified singleton CURRENT checkpoint for automatic continuity, persist a cache-stable filesystem warning before the agent runs, and fence old workers from affected sessions. Keep unknown command outcomes and unavailable or invalid archives fail-closed.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 7a08660: Make a finished child's result carry its answer. An idle `child_terminal_result` now includes optional `payload.finalAnswer`: the child's newest result-bearing answer, frozen by the idle settlement, bounded to 8 KiB UTF-8 with a head/tail truncation marker and a `session_events` pointer to the full text (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswer`, `CHILD_TERMINAL_RESULT_FINAL_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES`). No answer is copied when the child's newest turn failed, was cancelled or superseded, or stopped at a segment limit. A turn claimed only to continue the child's goal (for example one that confirms and completes the goal after the answer) no longer replaces the answer: the answer is reported with that turn's output after it as `finalAnswer.goalContinuations`, whole when the parts fit the bound (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswerWithGoalContinuations`). Parts that do not fit are reported as the newest part, marked truncated, with `omittedSequences` and a `nextAction` that reads every part, so a child working across goal continuations still reports its final report. The walk stops at a non-answer outcome and at the child's newest goal activation, and a window holding only continuations reports the newest answer alone. The worker's enrichment upsert now keeps the committed answer and evidence instead of replacing them, and an untruncated answer serves as the parent claim's consumption evidence. When a parent's exact live attempt reads a direct child's complete answer through `session_wait` or `session_events` in its own model call (the worker now marks first-party calls with `_meta.opengeniCaller`, `FIRST_PARTY_MCP_CALLER_META_KEY`; Codemode calls do not count), the answer is recorded on the reading turn (`metadata.consumedChildAnswers`, `recordConsumedChildAnswers`) and `session_wait` stops counting that child's result as own pending input (`listOutstandingSessionSystemUpdatesForAttempt`). The attempt's successful completion settlement supersedes each still-pending idle result whose every part it received (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and a result the child commits after that completion is inserted already consumed, without a wake. A read by an attempt that fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing. The operational contract and the `session_create`, `session_wait`, `session_get`, `session_send_message`, and `wait_for_input` descriptions now price a child, prefer a direct answer or reusing an existing child, and steer multi-minute waits to `wait_for_input` instead of alternating `session_wait` and `session_get`. No tool is capped or removed.
- 57f030c: Retain failed scheduled occurrences when connection-account selection blocks
  dispatch. Run history includes structured connector/account identifiers and
  safe eligibility reasons without credential values or raw error messages.
  Replaying an occurrence retains its original outcome without admitting work.
- 11151c6: Support a lossless scheduled-task model and reasoning patch through MCP, HTTP and the SDK. Preserve unrelated stored configuration and existing-session settings, keep normal authority validation, and reject concurrent execution-config changes instead of overwriting them.
- b28d5fa: Reading a session's stored bundled Skill selection now drops ids this build does not know instead of failing the whole session read. Dropping only narrows the stored selection; API input still rejects unknown ids, and keyed create replay still compares the exact stored selection. The bundled `document-parsing` guide now ships the upstream AnyDoc MIT license and a `SOURCES.md` attribution, the runtime package notices cover both AnyDoc-derived guidance copies, and the `skill_install` description no longer claims that `skill_search` returns library ids.
- e193b13: Add optional workspace-bot file-upload scope and an explicit, session-bound Slack retained-file delivery tool with durable upload checkpoints and uncertain-completion reconciliation. Existing bot installations remain eligible without files:write; administrators apply the canonical manifest and reinstall to enable uploads.
- bcd9988: Give the model the current time without a tool call, and ask supported models for shorter answers. Each claimed user message now carries a separate `[Message sent <weekday> <date> <HH:MM> UTC]` part taken from the turn's durable acceptance time, and each delivered machine-input batch states its `deliveredAt` and every member's `createdAt` (scheduled occurrences add `Delivered:` and `Created:` lines). The times are persisted with the history row, never computed at inference time, and never enter `Agent.instructions`. Agent turns on the Codex subscription, direct OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses routes send `text.verbosity: "low"` for GPT-5-family and later models; the new optional `textVerbosity` agent option is omitted everywhere else, so Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, chat and other compatible routes are unchanged. `reasoning.summary` is unchanged. Realtime voice-call history now keeps a user message's separate parts on separate lines.

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 585f2c1: Add an operator-disabled ephemeral Chromium BrowserSession mode for disposable sandbox verification. Explicit requests use isolated browser contexts within a trusted actor and placement partition, preserve existing private-profile defaults, and become terminal after shared process loss instead of silently recreating or replaying work.

### Patch Changes

- 1842911: Recover managed browser viewers through the existing session when an unrelated attached Chrome profile loses its connection. Negotiate focused-input observations so native select choices appear after a viewer click, with existing generation fences and explicit fallback for older controllers.
- ec707de: Negotiate bounded viewer typing batches from the active browser controller. Preserve
  individual text events and input order while reducing request overhead; recheck the
  original document fence before each action and discard uncertain queued input
  without replay. Older controllers retain sequential input.
- 3aab8f9: Allow a single MCP provider to use the existing aggregate tool-count allowance instead of dropping otherwise bounded catalogs above 1,000 tools. Align permissions discovery and explicit tool selections with the same allowance. Preserve definition, response, per-provider and aggregate byte limits and shared count accounting.

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 084616e: Advertise the product documentation the web console links from its Help menu.
  `ClientConfig` gains an optional `documentationUrl` field (an absolute http(s)
  URL, or `null` when the deployment hides the link) served by
  `/v1/config/client`, and `@opengeni/contracts` exports
  `DEFAULT_OPENGENI_DOCUMENTATION_URL`. Operators set it with the new
  `OPENGENI_DOCUMENTATION_URL` setting: unset means `https://docs.opengeni.ai`,
  `none` hides the link, and any other value fails startup. An absent
  field means a server that predates it, so clients show no link.
- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.
- 6eb431b: Allow authenticated hosts to replace an existing session MCP attachment with an accessible native connection through the standalone credential rotation API. An optional explicit replacement URL must match the native account's stored destination while the old URL remains a compare-and-set precondition. Preserve resource restrictions, version fencing, quiescence and idempotent receipts without replacing session history or accepted-attempt identity.
- e422b62: Add first-touch sign-up attribution contracts: the closed-charset `SignupAttribution` schema (slug tokens of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ ~ + -`, at most 100 characters) with its URL parameter names, the `SIGNUP_ACQUISITION_SOURCES` channel set, and `signupAcquisitionSource`, which normalizes untrusted campaign parameters into `producthunt`, `website`, `direct`, or `other` for bounded sign-up metrics. `StartManagedAuthSocialTransactionRequest` accepts an optional `attribution`; an invalid value is dropped rather than failing the social start.
- bd365b7: Add a public, content-free `POST /v1/client-errors` beacon that counts web
  client failures in `opengeni_client_errors_total{kind}` with per-kind admission
  bounds, a streamed 512-byte body limit and a same-deployment `Origin` check, and
  admit its grammar-validated route pattern and bundle revision in public
  structured logs. The shared wire grammar is exported from
  `@opengeni/contracts/client-error-report`.

### Patch Changes

- 48a8774: Generate automatic session titles on chat-completions providers, such as OpenRouter connections, through one direct request outside the agent runner instead of a runner-only traced call that always failed. Routes without a resolved provider client now take the same direct path. The title request uses the model's lowest runnable reasoning effort and a larger output budget, a response stopped by the output limit keeps only whole words, and inline `<think>` reasoning before the answer is dropped. Automatic titles no longer keep a dangling closing quote or markdown mark from a wrapped title such as `"Pod Crash Debugging"` or `**Pod Crash Debugging**`. The managed OpenRouter free route (`isManagedOpenRouterFreeRoute`: the deployment-funded OpenRouter provider serving a `:free` variant) sends no title request, because it would spend the deployment key's shared per-minute and per-day request limits that users' turns need; those sessions keep the prompt preview until a turn on another route titles them.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 23f4717: Accept canonical host-native source paths in retained file-publication receipts.
  Connected Machine publication now resolves and confines paths using the active
  filesystem root instead of assuming a managed `/workspace` root.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 86c710a: Expose a first-party Connected Machine enrollment-token tool with existing enrollment-management authority, short-lived tokens and deployment-bound installer commands. Include agent guidance without introducing an additional approval flow.

### Patch Changes

- d92af11: Keep original command text through ambiguous launch recovery and persist it separately from bounded previews. Preserve whitespace, mark clipped previews with an ellipsis, and show complete commands on expansion and hover.
- f60ca2b: Raise Skill folder limits eightfold to 1,024 files, 2 MiB per file, and 8 MiB total, while retaining bounded reads and existing validation.
- 2f8bc58: Use bounded readable MCP tool aliases while preserving exact account routing and historical approval rehydration. Retain action and account display metadata in native and Codemode timeline events and approval cards without changing execution or approval identity. Legacy opaque calls resolve only against the current authorized tool catalog.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

### Minor Changes

- 6d0a4de: Include opengeni-client in the default Skill catalog in local, self-hosted and
  managed deployments. The repository guide is the sole authored source; generated
  runtime assets include every reference and require no Pack, installation, network
  fetch or sandbox to read. Explicit bundledSkillIds selections still narrow it.

  Improve adaptive resource discovery, UI selection, runtime behavior, tool data
  semantics, and outcome-based verification without prescribing a fixed product
  architecture or answer format.

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.
- 1c924ed: Add authorized, resumable literal search of saved user and completed assistant
  messages, including unloaded history. Workspace search can return one
  representative match per session; in-session Find returns every occurrence with
  stable event identity and original-text UTF-16 offsets. Requests and browser
  result batches remain bounded, with explicit continuation and provisional counts.

  Expose bounded exact-sequence history navigation and message highlighting for
  React hosts. The web console connects a contextual session-search dialog to
  full-history Find, preserves search state across navigation, and keeps ended
  conversations readable. Tool output, reasoning and unfinished delta-only
  assistant messages are outside the initial searchable scope. Exact Markdown
  matches use a labeled source excerpt that stays in place when Find closes;
  readers can explicitly restore the formatted message.

- 3fa175e: Provide bundled OpenGeni product help with official documentation links,
  integration and billing boundaries, and dependency recovery guidance. Hosts can
  exclude it with the existing bundledSkillIds selection, including an empty list
  for embedded agents. Update the canonical integration guide.
- 132b945: Add organization-owned integration acquisition policy with a discoverable catalog,
  revisioned administration API and SDK, and organization settings. Enforce selected
  provider and custom-protocol permissions on supported setup and installation paths
  at preparation and persistence boundaries.

  Preserve ordinary ownership and authorization, exact completed-request replay,
  unchanged reconciliation, cancellation and other reducing operations. Existing
  connection execution and credential refresh are not revoked by this policy.
  Deployment-configured tools and embedding-host session-local MCP configuration
  retain their existing admission rules; this is not a network or execution allowlist.

  Apply the organization integration policy migration and matching role provisioning
  with the matching runtime before enabling the setting. Older runtimes do not enforce
  the new acquisition policy. See `docs/organization-integration-policy.md` for the
  administration, identity, persistence and recovery contract.

- 779b16b: Add an account-authorized organization usage summary with bounded UTC periods,
  lossless metered totals, chart buckets, and paginated workspace totals. The
  organization Billing dashboard uses this summary instead of recent-event sums.

  Use a transaction-scoped, owner-only analytical capability to apply private
  session visibility once per session before aggregating. Separate workspace-page
  reads retain the selected cutoff and do not recompute organization totals.

- 1cb688d: Add explicit permanent Skill removal review bindings and truthful removal receipts.
  Deletion approval is bound to the exact removal proposal; existing save approvals
  cannot authorize irreversible deletion. Review surfaces distinguish removal from
  activation and preserve conversations.
- 7e2436a: Keep ordinary chat attachments out of Knowledge unless selected as useful evidence or a reusable reference. Distinguish supporting evidence from discoverable references, preserve exact originals and revisions, and add read-only collection and duplicate discovery before saving. Includes maintenance migration 0469; old runtimes must be drained before activation.
- 9d9b94b: Expose named Plugin removal impact using the same classifier as Skill source
  release. Preserve customized/re-scoped Skills, resolve remaining owner names
  within workspace scope, and add optional preview-token fencing with refreshed
  409 previews when ownership or Skill state changes before confirmation. Retain
  Connection ownership, immutable Skill history, and human-only removal authority.

  Freeze the pre-comparison locked Skill head set through cleanup. A head made
  visible by another subject during confirmation now aborts removal with a refreshed
  409 preview instead of silently expanding the deactivation set.

- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.

### Patch Changes

- c31a951: Add connection-bound MCP tool permission discovery and Allow/Ask/Block management through the existing approval ledger, enforced consistently for direct tools and Codemode.

  Let workspace-default sessions inherit newly connected apps while retaining per-session connector exclusions and exact explicit selections. Present connected apps, logos, health, and reconnection in the composer connector menu. Keep internal runtime controls out of workspace settings and use Capabilities consistently in settings navigation.

- f90d628: Add explicit managed-human consent for same-session singleton Modal recovery from
  an exact older CURRENT checkpoint. Protect membership, route and artifact identity,
  retain durable replay receipts and generation provenance, and reconstruct a model
  warning before later inference. Separate consent from verified restoration and
  never replay failed commands. Refuse Retry on an unchanged blocked effective route
  without blocking an independently selected Connected Machine. Additive migration
  0495 keeps consent DB-disabled until operator-verified compatible rollout; permanent
  consent receipts reject old inference claims even after disabling consent or lease
  replacement. Only the warning-aware worker declares the scoped protocol.
  Preserve explicit failed-turn Retry after verified recovery or Connected Machine
  selection, and retain consent identity when post-accept status reads lose access.
  Keep fresh migration-before-role-provisioning and later runtime-role provisioning
  safe, with SELECT-only rollout access and owner-only activation.
- aa09567: Preserve explicit host MCP delegation selections through durable composer Send and Steer admission, including exact retries after an uncertain response. Keep existing owner, generation, visibility, revocation and replay checks; omitted selections do not inherit authority.
- d1ab270: Persist configured skill catalogs as versioned conversation context, preserving prior prompt history across catalog updates, retries, compaction, and forks.
- c8bb974: Accept native MCP OAuth clients during dynamic registration: ignore extra RFC 7591 metadata, allow custom-scheme redirect URIs, and return a continue page after consent instead of a raw redirect that embedded browsers drop.
- 332a02d: Accept an explicit null skill-review reference for ordinary structured human-input questions while retaining strict validation of real review references and their host-owned confirmation presentation.
- 621201d: Distinguish queued sessions from running agents and expose durable dispatch wait
  evidence in session detail reads, including retry timing and recorded errors.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- f7c9169: Support verified-email Google and GitHub sign-in linking and personal sign-in
  method management. Preserve canonical user ownership and email-verification
  checks, require recent authentication for sensitive changes, prevent removal of
  the last usable method, and respect explicit provider disconnection until a
  verified reconnect. Surface actionable callback feedback and security
  notification outcomes without granting integration access.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 85cafd0: Add a shared workspace/session artifact catalog over existing Sites, editable artifacts, generated images, and published files. Keep file bytes and content authorization in their existing domains, expose bounded filtered discovery through the SDK, and retain explicit sandbox-file publication provenance. The web Artifacts library includes type/search/sort controls, grid/list views, retained image previews, and file viewers that do not wake compute. Published images use the shared chat image/lightbox presentation; ordinary HTML file downloads remain non-executable.

### Patch Changes

- 7746251: Prevent agent-authored workspace instruction changes from replacing the complete active policy, fence unsafe older pending revisions at approval, and show reviewers the current and proposed instruction text before approval.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Minor Changes

- ad9dc2f: Add a non-provisioning external identity lookup and opt-in, operation-keyed service workspace onboarding. Cancellation-bearing revocation reuses native membership teardown and the organization-workspace receipt ledger to fence a delayed grant, including when no membership exists yet. Legacy unkeyed onboarding remains unchanged and cannot be fenced retroactively.
- da4a85f: Add native organization-admin MCP credential resolver registration by stable workspace externalSource. Support encrypted, idempotent generation-checked endpoint/secret rotation and revocation with fail-closed namespace routing and live physical-use fencing. Existing accepted participant, schedule and child authority remains unchanged. Migration 0463 requires maintenance and matching API/worker binaries.

### Patch Changes

- 50ac837: Add explicit accepted-turn host binding selection for shared conversations. Capture each participant's exact owner delegation without changing the configured destination or borrowing creator credentials, preserve fixed bindings and scheduled/child live authority checks, and apply session-local server configuration to follow-up selection. Document the supported empty-session then first-text admission flow.
- 750060c: Support inline HTML visualizations, retained images, and embedded Sites in chat. Add a plain HTML Site client, preserve application request headers through the shared bridge, document visualization workflows, and use Image 2.5 Sunburst for Codex image generation.
- 123cf57: Make agent-authored workspace instruction changes non-destructive: append new rules by default, require one exact anchor for edits or removals, and reserve complete replacement for an explicit mode while preserving baseline conflict checks and instruction budgets.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 935af4e: Add an authorized standalone session inline MCP credential rotation operation with durable idempotent receipts, exact destination and credential-version fencing, and atomic quiescence checks. Expose the operation through HTTP and the SDK without sending messages, scheduling work, retrying external mutations, or widening connection or attempt authority. Keep existing message-bound credential updates unchanged.
- d08dbb6: Support capability-gated transactional large-file edits on Connected Machines,
  with bounded transfers, verified outcomes, and live authorization checks. Keep
  legacy agent writes compatible and report oversized outbound requests accurately
  instead of marking a healthy agent offline. Native agent support is required;
  unsupported filesystem semantics fail closed.

### Patch Changes

- 4e2b59d: Route plugin discovery types and endpoint compatibility through the public SDK boundary, using a narrow contracts entry without schema-runtime imports.
- 488a69b: Expose bounded current-failure evidence on session detail reads so recovery diagnostics do not depend on timeline pagination. Show recorded consecutive retry streaks without inventing lifetime totals, and distinguish Codex account assignment, affinity/lease reuse, and actual switches without changing allocation policy.

  Read session status and its replay cursor coherently, decode bounded diagnostics through the lossless storage codec, and record account transitions atomically against the current assignment with attempt-keyed replay and compatible switch reasons.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e1a50ba: Spool Linux host-backed workspace archives through capture, object storage, and cold restore instead of materializing whole JSON/base64 payloads. Isolate each upload at a fresh physical locator and verify stored bytes without assuming conditional-PUT support. Preserve legacy locators, archive format, configured restore limits, and lease capture/publication authority; retain candidates after ambiguous publication outcomes.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 6a60a58: Canonicalize typed Skill review cards using host-owned choices. Allow explicit
  authorized Save/Don't save responses to existing exact-bound cards with the
  legacy Other flag and null option descriptions, without rewriting cards,
  manufacturing consent, or weakening human, tenant, turn, or revision fences.
  Apply rolling migration 0458; pre-0435 runtimes remain unsupported.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- cffd21b: Use authenticated canonical users instead of session end-user labels. Session
  creation rejects caller-supplied identity scope; list filters use scopeSubjectId.
  Chat user mode uses asUser and explicit workspace membership, while collaborators
  address the same session ID. Reopen legacy user-namespaced chats by session ID.

  Retire active session Memory in favor of task notes. Historical session Memory
  remains stored and old selectors hydrate as off, never workspace. User Memory
  uses the verified active-turn user. Preserve frozen scheduled agent-reach policy.
  Migration 0457 requires the documented maintenance cutover and matching writers.

### Minor Changes

- f8be7df: Allow hosts to render inline connection setup for timeline authentication requests. Add an optional safe return path to Fiken OAuth so setup can return to the originating conversation.
- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

## 2.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 1b0f4f2: Expose unavailable background command observations separately from command lifecycle state, and render that uncertainty in command and session status.

## 2.15.1

### Patch Changes

- 068be26: Complete a Skill save in the same transaction as its one verified human chat decision. Show the full immutable Skill folder, preserve exact scope and revision checks, and refuse delegated, stale, or mismatched approval. Autonomous saves activate directly; declining a proposal preserves existing active guidance.
- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 2.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 9827c25: Add message action slots and an optional source message boundary for managed-human forks. The web UI places turn feedback and Fork from here beside Copy and the timestamp. Message forks preserve existing authorization and idempotency, copy only the selected canonical history prefix, and reject ambiguous, compacted, or incomplete boundaries.

  Migration 0429 requires draining the API and both worker pools and provisioning the updated runtime routine contract before starting the new binary.

- 14dd6fe: Add workspace transcription provider preferences and optional fallback after explicit rejection, preserving recording pins after uncertain or successful attempts. Refresh expired SuperGrok credentials and recover the provider's invalid-credential 403 response.

### Patch Changes

- 231b103: Apply explicit Codex account switches and unpins to capacity-blocked turns, preserving the same turn and history through recovery. Display current account selection separately from future preferences and report when a switch requests a capacity recheck.
- 392c575: Retain Modal command handles, provider execution identities, output, and exact exit status across provider-client reconstruction. Persist stream pages before acknowledging their cursors, and treat unavailable historical locators as unknown rather than proof of process loss. Execution status is provider-owned and never read from sandbox-writable files.
- 5904fd1: Remove the Site SDK endpoint allowlist. Workspace API requests now reach ordinary authorization handlers in published Sites and sandbox previews; tenant routing, agent permission limits, and direct integration-tool checks remain unchanged. Clarify the distinction between authoring, preview, and viewer access in the Sites skill, including honest reporting of viewer-only verification.

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 4536385: Expose independently configurable GitHub action approval policies for routine writes, review submission, and pull-request merges, while preserving capability-first defaults, explicit policies, and attempt-frozen execution authority.
- fa12951: Separate command interaction from session history. Add bounded retained-output command reads and use the same operation for command waits. Terminal reads observe completion and suppress only still-pending completion notifications; running reads, claimed notifications, and historical tool results remain unchanged.

  Make session history conversation-first with complete-message pagination and explicit results, tools, and debug views. Preserve cursor detail selection, provide oversized-message continuation, and keep queued prompts distinct from processed conversation. Update concise model guidance for the new surfaces.

  `command_wait` now uses `waitSeconds`, an output cursor, and the same flat result as `command_read`; clients using the previous command wrapper must update. Apply the additive command-observation migration before starting the new readers.

- d9dbd5d: Add authenticated general feedback and session/turn ratings with exact comments,
  author attribution, idempotent submission, and private-session isolation.
- c90f3fc: Make workspace tool and plugin defaults independently inheritable. Add explicit reset patches, preserve existing custom lists, and prevent unrelated plugin saves from freezing built-in defaults. Show inherited/custom mode and partial group counts, with deliberate customization and inspectable individual tools.
- 0c39126: Add per-connection turn-model permissions and organization workspace assignment
  for subscriptions and model gateways. Migration 0424 requires draining APIs and
  workers; do not restart older workers after policies are enabled.

  Fix organization Codex sign-in in local mode without granting managed-human reset-credit ownership to the local administrator.

- 0c39126: Add organization SuperGrok subscription pools with multiple accounts, active selection, rotation, and shared/Personal workspace inheritance. Preserve the exact subscription scope of accepted work and organization-only management authority. Unify Codex and SuperGrok account rows and connection actions in the web settings.

  Maintenance migration 0423 requires draining API and workers before upgrading. Older workers cannot parse the organization subscription scope.

- 575af5b: Expose workspace project management through MCP, including shared pins/order, session filing, project-filtered discovery and project selection at session creation. Bundle concise, on-demand project organization guidance for every agent, independent of compute backend and retain existing session authorization checks.
- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- 2fb17fd: Track published Site session origin automatically; add origin-filtered session
  listing and skill defaults for reusable in-Site conversations. Site provenance
  remains independent of project placement and session authorization.
- 107aa14: Support standard SDK/React conversations in Sites and sandbox previews, direct
  HTML/source uploads, exact deployment package pins, and embedded layout/queue
  defaults. Refresh exhausted Grok capacity after external resets.
- 0a81cc8: Add durable workspace pause/resume timers with duration controls, countdowns,
  manual cancellation, and idempotent worker execution. Migration 0420 requires a
  maintenance deployment: drain old writers and deploy matching API/workers.

### Patch Changes

- 22a6704: Correct oversized session-message continuation with bounded source slicing, preserve typed runner terminal failures during command observation, and keep retained command output readable when live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure. Refresh fallback rechecks API authorization and explicitly marks unavailable freshness; it does not mask integrity or authorization errors.
- 7dac7e3: Decode bounded session-monitoring progress scalars with their persisted lossless codec version. Preserve canonical prefixes and explicit truncation without reporting encoded storage lengths as original character counts. Clarify that completion joins use the last consumed event cursor, not a session snapshot watermark that may already include an unread child result.

  Validate the complete stored progress scalar before decoding its bounded prefix, preserving literal malformed codec markers even when an invalid suffix lies beyond the read boundary.

- fa2b99a: Preserve workflow wake retries until pending input is admitted, while future waits stay parked at their deadline, and expose current session waits and waiting descendant counts. Refresh wait status on live events and retain the status projection sequence so newer session reads cannot be overwritten by older events.
- c1dc59b: Default sessions_list and session_get MCP results to compact actionable discovery and child-management state. Retain the legacy bounded projections through detail: full, including effectiveToolPolicy for configuration inspection. Make related-work evidence opt-in for plain compact browse while automatically retaining search evidence and its advisory-only authority facts. Preserve exact cursors, goal completion evidence, pause reasons, and REST/UI defaults; keep target-only ancestor control redacted in both detail modes.
- 1fc0889: Group deployment-provided models under OpenGeni regardless of upstream provider. Badge only explicitly free models, keep paid rows compact, and preserve separate workspace, organization, and subscription connections with accurate payment descriptions.
- d06450c: Capture final provider HTTP request bodies for the context inspector, including conversation input and provider-normalized tools/settings. Keep unsupported or oversized captures explicitly unavailable, label section/item token estimates, and preserve transport cancellation and streaming behavior.
- c69ad5f: Preserve externally managed history across opaque compaction checkpoints and verify conversation persistence before continuation. Reject shifted history prefixes and conflicting saved items instead of silently losing completed work.
- 1c4b707: Expose goal_resume so agents can resume any paused goal without a pause-reason restriction; include it for existing sessions with goal_pause.
- 414946c: Inherit model, effort and speed from the latest started turn for follow-ups and voice handoffs. Project the same policy in session reads, fresh drafts and Insights without changing accepted turns or stored creation settings.
- 6de9fe3: Preserve newer composer draft content and project provenance when a stale realtime create records selection history, while exposing optional project provenance consistently across contracts and SDK types. Store project provenance in rolling-upgrade-safe additive draft columns behind a metadata fence, concurrent partial index, bounded resumable backfill, and separately committed validation; dual-write mixed-version draft writers without holding schema locks across legacy-row scans. Avoid passive hydration autosaves and honor the latest route launch intent when hydration completes.
- cda46e8: Resolve session schedule indicators from current indexed schedule targets, including paused schedules. Add a session-filtered schedules list so existing chats link to all schedules targeting them without reading workspace schedules in the browser.
- 3a29372: Keep embedded conversation foreground and background theme-matched. Support filtering published Sites by creating or publishing session for the session Artifacts panel.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b65383: Replace goal-scoped long waits with self-only session-level `wait_for_input`, add provider-neutral `command_wait`, and deliver terminal background-command proof as exactly-once durable agent input with workflow wakes for nonterminal sessions while preserving event-only audit for terminal sessions.

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- b420912: Show the exact model-visible system instructions, tools, skills, and token counts in the session Debug inspector.

### Patch Changes

- d63ee0f: Keep Connected Machine file links in the target's canonical filesystem namespace, including Windows drive and UNC roots, and reject stale file requests with a retryable route conflict.

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 38de50d: Enable Workspace Memory by default, require approval by default for agent-derived Workspace instructions and Skills, and use the clearer Require approval label for workspace and organization governance settings.
- 8b42f58: Add the managed-human API, SDK, and atomic tenant lifecycle for creating additional organizations with an isolated Personal workspace and a first shared team workspace.
- 0214875: Price model usage with a 5% default markup and dedicated cache-write rates, and show provider estimates, equivalent OpenGeni credit prices, and actual credit-path prices separately in Insights.
- e2a668b: Add the built-in, instruction-only OpenGeni Product Integration Pack for adaptive, tenant-safe customer integrations, with explicit per-session activation that prevents its implementation guidance from entering ordinary customer chats.
- 9c45eae: Keep pending sessions distinguishable with a sensitive-safe opening-prompt preview or short session reference, and let bounded parallel semantic title generation finish after quick responses instead of cancelling it at turn settlement.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f81b57: Add authenticated, bounded GitHub branch suggestions for exact workspace App
  repositories and exact selected personal OAuth repositories, including focused
  contract and SDK subpaths. Recheck repository authority around provider
  requests, keep provider credentials server-side, and preserve arbitrary refs at
  the session resource boundary. Add lazy branch pickers, verified public GitHub
  URL attachment with immutable commit fencing, explicit anonymous-clone warnings
  for other HTTPS hosts, render-safe manual drafts, idempotent unlink
  reconciliation, and debounced live repository refreshes across new and existing
  sessions.

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.
- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.
- 9af1666: Keep backward session-history pagination advancing across oversized legacy events by applying the canonical bounded read projection instead of failing the page, and report when a forensic response is no longer byte-for-byte exact.

## 2.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 5b9acd1: Make session attention monotonic across rapid navigation and nested trees. Failed sessions now remain red only until the viewer or their parent agent acknowledges the latest event, while historical failure lifecycle state remains intact.

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- b471a90: Add an organization-owner Off, Review first, or Autonomous policy for agent-managed organization identity, including owner-only API and SDK controls, exact-attempt automatic activation, immutable receipts, and the organization settings control.
- 96624a7: Move agent computer interaction to managed ComputerSession tools. The legacy runtime desktop API remains exported only as a deprecated, fail-closed migration shell; because direct sandbox desktop control and model-bound tools are no longer functional, release `@opengeni/runtime` as the next major. Managed observations now carry bounded native image content for visual model input while preserving viewer control, explicit manual/on-verify recording, and historical contract parsing.
- 4bacdd3: Add fixed-scope organization API keys, idempotent external tenant workspace provisioning, Personal-workspace exclusion, and the matching SDK and integration guidance.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 699477a: Restore autonomous agent Workspace Memory writes whenever workspace Memory is enabled. Agents can save and correct active facts, decisions, incidents, fixes, and outcomes independently of Learning mode while all existing Memory kinds remain retrieval-only through search. Autonomous learning may activate eligible concise Workspace instructions and focused Skills through their governed, auditable, undoable lifecycles; Review first keeps proposals inactive and Off creates no derived change.
- ddce5cc: Allow scheduled generated sessions and nested workers to target an exact Connected Machine, and fail closed without leaving an unstarted generated session behind when that route cannot be established.
- 132c8d3: Require self-hosted-only session defaults to resolve to a reachable Connected Machine. Keep the composer blocked when no eligible machine exists instead of submitting an unroutable session.
- 88b6b48: Share Variable Set reserved-name validation between the API and web UI, and make Variable Set editing and variable management clearer and more actionable.

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 80d7594: Show a bounded, sensitive-safe opening-prompt preview while a session's durable automatic title is still pending, then yield automatically to the semantic agent title or a human rename.

### Patch Changes

- 595939e: Add managed Google and GitHub sign-in through fenced browser session-set transactions, server-side OAuth state, provider-aware canonical login bindings, and isolated popup UI flows.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c116379: Improve organization and workspace administration with compact people management, workspace-admin member controls, personal integration and Codex subscription setup, clearer permission presets, consistent connector presentation, and organization-scoped resource navigation.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7238fa4: Add permission-scoped advisory work discovery, durable non-exclusive typed work claims, bounded related-work projections, independent rollout controls, observability, and SDK topology filters.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a7912ea: Add a one-click, owner-authorized OpenGeni Lens GitHub App installation flow for the PR Review Pack, backed by durable single-use OAuth authority, shared signed-webhook routing, and exact-repository least-privilege installation tokens. Keep bring-your-own GitHub App, GitLab, and Azure DevOps registration as the provider-neutral advanced path.
- 986f5fe: Add provider-neutral browser login session sets with bounded independently revocable slots, explicit actor switching, isolated add and re-authentication, scoped logout, non-enumerating cross-slot deep-link recovery, and rolling legacy/dual/broker compatibility.
- 6e12f3a: Add canonical-human organization recovery custody with exactly three accepted custodians, two-person approval, a fixed seven-day cooldown, promotion-only co-owner execution, durable notification evidence, and immutable workspace organization ownership.

### Patch Changes

- 9ef491b: Add the Agent Knowledge product surface, Personal workspace knowledge views and defaults, workspace learning-autonomy administration, explicit routing guidance between Memory, Skills, and Workspace instructions, authority-first organization Document search, exact replay-safe confirmed Memory materialization, and the narrower organization identity/mission boundary with richer facts retrieved from organization knowledge.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.
- b5071cf: Require every Rig to layer setup and checks on the deployment-managed platform sandbox, reject new explicit Rig image overrides, keep provider-native image ids out of durable lease identity, and verify Browser, Terminal, and Computer services before publishing a Rig provider image.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 47b88d3: Add explicit managed onboarding: ordinary verified signup completes an organization-name-only setup that creates only the owner membership and canonical Personal workspace, while unregistered invitees can use a digest-only one-time account setup link before signing in normally.
- c5e4684: Expose bounded organization-admin audit APIs and SDK methods for Default-collection backfill runs, operations, workspace receipts, and organization-wide Document authority reclassifications.
- dc10a36: Let an administrator see and set which OpenGeni workspace each Slack channel starts work in, from the Slack capability sheet. A channel with no choice is not broken: it asks the first person who uses it and remembers the answer, and the sheet says so.

### Patch Changes

- 977fa0f: Add durable provider-neutral invited-user email delivery with scope-bound retention fences, ambiguity-preserving retries, digest-only setup preview, and explicit delivery state across the API, SDK, and organization administration experience.
- 9d251cb: Add server-owned viewer, member, and administrator roles for shared organization workspaces, an explicit Personal/shared workspace kind, a privacy-safe administration projection, and audited idempotent grant and revocation commands.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f30555c: Add atomic same-workspace session forks with an explicit private or workspace destination. Private-to-workspace copies require a durable acknowledgement, workspace members may fork a shared source into fresh authority of their own, and private sources remain owner-only. Exact applied receipts remain recoverable by the same live workspace actor after mutable source authority changes, while changed requests conflict and fresh keys still require current source authority. Every fork receives fresh authority, provenance, root, and sandbox-group identity without inheriting live grants, credentials, Connections, turns, goals, MCP, resource attachments, processes, or pins. The managed web control now exposes the generic Fork dialog to authorized shared-session members and verifies the returned owned destination before navigation.
- 47ccfab: Workspaces can persist exact default MCP servers and first-party OpenGeni tools for new sessions. Session creation, workspace-default policy updates, and scheduled session creation apply that policy while preserving the previous deployment defaults for workspaces without an override.
- b74e557: Add an explicit, replay-safe Document authority-reclassification lifecycle and
  a resumable organization Default-collection backfill. Reclassification requires
  the exact expected authority tuple, updates the Document and every chunk in one
  transaction, and retains immutable before/after receipts. The SDK and API expose
  the account-admin and actor-fenced operations, bounded cursor-paginated receipt
  history, and same-organization portable-personal behavior without making
  collections an authority boundary.
- b2cd0f0: Slack can notify the human when work they started stops making progress, **off by default and switched on per workspace**. The new `slackOrchestrationNotices` workspace setting carries one boolean per notice (`childRequiresAction`, `goalPaused`), two checkboxes sit beside the reaction shortcut in the Slack integration settings, and `resolveWorkspaceSlackOrchestrationNoticeSettings` fails closed: absent, malformed, or partially invalid settings resolve to both disabled, so only an explicit opt-in ever posts. An unsolicited Slack post is worse than a missed one, and the in-app rail and priority feed already surface this work.

  When a workspace opts in, a Slack-originated session's `child_requires_action` notice becomes one bounded pointer card ("A worker you started needs input", a single-line first-question or waiting-approval preview, and an **Open in OpenGeni** link to the child session), and a goal that pauses for `limits` or `max_auto_continuations` becomes one bounded line. Deferred child lifecycle notices, `user_pause` / `api` / `agent` / `no_progress` pauses, and `goal.resumed` stay silent, and so does a blocked-worker notice whose exact `(child, turn, generation)` boundary already carries a resolution or whose own row is `superseded` or `cancelled` - Slack delivery runs behind the session, and a card announcing a worker that is no longer blocked is worse than no card. Both notices draw on the same durable per-interaction slot budget as assistant progress, so an orchestration that fans out to many blocked children cannot turn one thread into a feed; a slot is claimed only when a card is actually going to be posted.

  A disabled notice takes the same "nothing to post for this event" path as an undeliverable one - no post, no ledger row, and the delivery cursor advances identically - and every pre-existing Slack card type is unaffected. Both reuse the durable per-event post-operation ledger, so reaper retries and replica claims cannot double-post. Rolling migration `0329_slack_orchestration_delivery_events.sql` adds `system.update.pending` and `goal.paused` to the Slack delivery claim's event types, and `@opengeni/db` exports the read-only `getSessionSystemUpdateById` and `childRequiresActionResolutionExists` used to resolve the exact typed notice and prove it is still current.

### Patch Changes

- 1b21135: Attach a selected user-owned Connected Machine atomically when creating a session from the managed web console, including recovery-stable `once` authority.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: Child lifecycle notices. `SessionSystemUpdateKind` gains `child_requires_action`, `child_requires_action_resolved`, `child_paused`, `child_waiting_capacity`, and `child_progress` with typed, bounded payload schemas (no subject ids, credentials, or raw tool arguments), plus `SESSION_SYSTEM_UPDATE_WAKE_CLASS` (`immediate` for every pre-existing kind and `child_requires_action`; `deferred` for the other four) and `CHILD_LIFECYCLE_SYSTEM_UPDATE_KINDS`. The first-party tool catalog gains `session_human_input_respond` (default selection, not goal-required). The SDK mirrors the new kinds and tool name.
- de3f376: Bound and shape the durable text an agent authors on a user's behalf. The budget
  follows the destination, on every agent surface that reaches it. A mandatory
  workspace rule is composed verbatim into the prompt of every session it applies
  to, so `remember`, `instruction_policy_propose`, and `task_note_promote_instruction_policy`
  are all capped at 600 characters; the preference destination is capped at 1,200
  across its three surfaces, because only its short descriptor is composed and the
  content is retrieved on demand. Task-note promotion is checked in the database
  layer, where the content is the note rather than a request field, and is rejected
  rather than truncated before any evidence, claim, or proposal row is written.
  `company_profile_propose`, the largest always-on surface, is capped for agents at
  400 characters per scalar, 200 per list entry, and 4,096 UTF-8 bytes total. The
  Knowledge lane keeps its 4,000-character retrieval-evidence ceiling, and every
  human editor limit is unchanged so nothing a person already typed becomes
  invalid. Tool descriptions now state the prompt cost and the authoring shape, and
  the `remember` confirmation card names the character count and destination so a
  human can judge the cost before saving. Existing stored revisions are never
  rewritten.
- e6ffdc7: Add the `backoff_pending` goal continuation reason (idle pacing between consecutive no-input continuations, `nextAttemptAt` at the pacing deadline) and the `SessionGoalResumedReason` / `SessionGoalResumedEventPayload` contracts for `goal.resumed` (`api` for the operator PATCH, `external_input` for the system resume of a `max_auto_continuations` pause). The React goal pill treats `backoff_pending` as ordinary scheduled work.
- 0b3b8df: Add an explicit organization-owner-confirmed agent path for company-profile and
  strategic-goal administration. The two-step MCP flow stages an immutable inactive
  full-profile proposal, binds activation to the initiating human's exact
  structured confirmation, revalidates current organization authority and profile
  CAS in PostgreSQL under the canonical workspace/session lock order, and remains
  independent of workspace learning mode. The manual `account:admin` route keeps
  its admission contract, and the earlier proposal-only `company_profile_propose`
  tool (`durable_learning` provenance) is retired in favor of this path.
- bbd19e0: Add an owner/admin organization setting that enables Only-me chats in shared
  workspaces for organizations holding the session-tenancy readiness receipt
  (`GET`/`PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/private-session-settings`,
  `@opengeni/sdk/organization-private-session-settings`, and the organization
  settings page). Already activated organizations are backfilled enabled.
- 5d664d8: Surface why a goal is not pursuing and how long children have waited for a human. `Session.treeStats` gains optional `attentionSince` (earliest `requires_action` entry among the counted attention descendants), `Session` gains optional `requiresActionSince` on list and lineage reads, and the goal continuation projection gains optional `holdReason` for a `held_for_input` hold. `SessionChrome`'s goal pill spells out the pause reason ("Paused · cap" / "budget" / "by you" / "agent"), explains an idle-backoff check time and an agent `goal_wait` hold, and exports `sessionChromeGoalPillLabel` / `sessionChromeGoalPillExplanation`.

### Patch Changes

- e91d89e: Open Markdown `sandbox:` file links in the current session's Files workbench, preserve exact decoded paths through the selected filesystem authority, reveal deep lazy-tree ancestors, and handle malformed references safely.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ab81e47: Allow the managed staging Slack app and bot to use the visibly distinct `OpenGeni Staging` identity. The manifest, runtime configuration, installation verification, durable binding contract, SDK, web projection, and deployment artifacts now preserve one closed environment-qualified display-name setting while production continues to default to `OpenGeni`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e1ad07: Add turn-atomic personal Variable Set and Rig attachments for create, Send, and
  Steer, including logical-turn once receipts, recovery-safe snapshots, warning
  acknowledgement, and SDK contracts.
- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- ebb3669: Add the agent-facing `company_profile_propose` first-party MCP tool over a new `proposeCompanyProfile` seam: an exact agent attempt records one inactive organization company-profile proposal (durable-learning provenance, `agent-attempt:<attemptId>` source) that an organization account admin reviews and activates from Company Brain → Company profile & goals, which now lists pending proposals with their content.
- dc8c73f: Add professional organization administration with canonical rename and a
  Personal-safe shared-workspace access inventory, explicit Organization /
  Workspace / Only-me scope at Rig and Variable Set creation, and activation-gated
  atomic private visibility when creating sessions.
- fbc760e: Add the first-party `goal_wait` MCP tool and a durable goal continuation hold.
  An orchestrator whose active goal depends on child sessions or an external
  event records a bounded hold (reason plus mandatory deadline, at most 7 days)
  with a `goal.held` timeline fact instead of busy-polling. The continuation
  materializer returns `held` while the declaring turn is still the latest
  finished turn and the deadline is ahead: it never consumes the goal wake
  revision and re-arms a delayed workflow wake at the deadline on every idle
  evaluation. Pending machine input wins with `queue`, and any newer finished
  turn, a passed deadline, or a human/API/agent goal mutation clears the hold.
  The goal projection reports a current hold as `blocked` / `held_for_input`
  with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline (rolling migration 0317).
- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- fe54954: Add an authorized, quiescence-fenced API and SDK operation for permanently deleting a root session tree.
- f7497fd: Add a disabled-by-default, user-owned personal GitHub OAuth lifecycle with
  separate deployment credentials, signed PKCE state, encrypted token custody,
  verified GitHub identity, typed SDK routes, reconnect fencing, and idempotent
  disconnect.
- ff011e6: Add bounded owner-only personal GitHub repository discovery, immutable selected-repository
  authority storage, full-replacement and verification APIs, typed SDK methods, and exact
  accepted-turn/scheduled-task authority snapshots for explicitly bound repository resources.
  The dedicated `connectionType: "github_personal"` resource discriminator preserves existing
  host-opaque Git credential bindings without reclassifying them as personal OAuth authority.
  Runtime Git and GitHub API execution remain unavailable until their separately audited broker
  and provider-consumer phases land.
- ba0be3d: Add activation-gated owner management for personal-resource session and standing grants, with kind-derived actions and permissions, exact session authority epochs, route-workspace-fenced revocation, RFC3339 lifecycle timestamps, bounded keyset pages, complete credential-free delegation receipts, FORCE-RLS-safe expiry and invalid-action settlement, and SDK methods that intentionally exclude standalone `once` and custom expiry.
- c7cafb1: Activate owner-only session visibility changes and same-workspace private forks
  through the public API and SDK after per-organization tenancy activation.

  Expose activation-gated session tenancy metadata, typed quiescence and
  idempotency conflicts, exact durable event fanout, and explicit retry fences.

- 5a651c8: Add the blocking first-party `session_wait` MCP tool so an agent can wait for new durable events on child or peer sessions, or for its own pending machine input, in one bounded call instead of sleeping and polling `session_events`/`session_get`/`sessions_list`.
- 29a44c2: Spill oversized model-visible tool results to a workspace File instead of failing the tool or stuffing huge JSON into history. Codemode keeps the 16 MiB journal cap.
- 48b9f09: Allow organization administrators to invite an email before registration, bind
  the invitation only after exact Better Auth email verification, and apply its
  initial shared-workspace access when the invited user joins without creating a
  redundant fallback organization.

### Patch Changes

- 9b4d5d5: Create Stripe invoices for prepaid-credit Checkout payments and expose an authorized Stripe Customer Portal session for invoices and payment information.
- 492fb71: Allow foreground session readers to acknowledge an exact rendered event sequence so later unseen events remain unread.
- 650d6f9: Route OpenSandbox browser and computer streams through the API frame-proxy so the workbench can show live JPEG/RFB when the lifecycle proxy cannot carry browserd WebSocket grants.
- 5b509be: Advertise cwd-relative sandbox file paths to the model, and return the SDK execCommand banner (exit code + stdout/stderr) from Connected Machines.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2cb04e0: Retire Memory V1's standing prompt block and its agent writes. `memoryPromptMode` is now always `retrieval_only`: no pinned/recency working set is injected into any agent prompt, and the `legacy_standing` rollback opt-out can no longer be selected. The `memory_save` and `memory_correct` first-party tools are removed; durable agent writes go through `remember` (explicit user-directed) and task-note promotion (the agent's own findings), while `memory_search` remains so an agent can still read what a workspace knows.

  Nothing is rewritten or deleted: `knowledge_memories` rows, human REST/UI audit, search, correction, export, and the Memory Slack publication path are unchanged. A workspace that stored `legacy_standing` keeps the stored value in its passthrough settings bag, where it simply stops meaning anything, and already accepted turns keep the mode they recorded because those snapshots are immutable facts about what was composed. Migration 0295 changes no data; it reports whether anything was still relying on the mode rather than assuming it was unused.

### Minor Changes

- 1c78ed0: Separate new-session and established-session composer policy authority. Exact draft submission now atomically freezes queued-turn text, resources, model, reasoning, and latency, then rotates the server draft; queue Edit restores that exact snapshot and stale revisions surface as conflicts instead of silent rebases.
- 79ee99b: Preference descriptors now carry `activationAuthority` (`human_confirmed` | `automatic` | `null`) alongside `provenance.trust`. Trust stays the frozen creation-time fact - a revision an agent proposed reads `untrusted_proposal` forever, and both activation adapters still require that value - while the new field answers the separate question of whether a human explicitly confirmed the activation or policy activated it automatically, read from the governed-learning activation receipt at descriptor-build time. Descriptors built before this field existed parse as `null`, which keeps their immutable stored JSON and pinned descriptor hash valid.

### Patch Changes

- f4afa19: Resume requires_action only from the open suffix plus paired history. Pause stores the sentinel instead of a leftover SDK RunState heap.
- 8583779: Resume `requires_action` from paired history plus a bounded open suffix instead of materializing an oversized SDK RunState blob.
- 6d22ab5: Widen the task-note expiry ceiling from 30 to 90 days. Task notes are pure agent-to-agent coordination within one root session tree; resuming a paused root session/task tree after a longer gap previously lost all coordination notes silently. `TASK_NOTE_MAX_LIFETIME_DAYS` is now the single source of truth, referenced by the application-layer bound checks and `remember`'s evidence note instead of a hardcoded literal. Fully backward compatible: every existing row and every caller supplying 1-30 days keeps working unchanged.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b05130a: Hard-cut editable spreadsheets to authored-only canonical state, deterministic formula projections, and explicit current compatibility protocols. Preserve React compatibility with artifact-tool 0.1 and 0.2 while adding the 0.3 line.
- 55e0417: Raise the durable per-session system-instruction limit from 32768 to 65536 characters across the public and first-party MCP contracts.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c2d958: Google Drive publication freezes its exact output destination on the accepted delegation, so a later connection-settings change fails an already-accepted turn's publication closed instead of silently redirecting it. Every publication sits behind exactly one durable execute-once connector fence (the attempt connector-action wrapper for model callers, the tool's own registration for Codemode callers): a failure before the first mutating provider request settles not_executed with a retry-safe message, while a failure after it settles uncertain and surfaces the unknown outcome.
- 4c2d958: Scoped stream tokens (`ogs_`, 120 s TTL unchanged) now carry the authenticated viewer subject and the session's live authority epoch (migration 0281). The viewer lease holder records the same pair monotonically, the API re-verifies a human viewer's current workspace membership at every mint and degrades the stream to `transport:null` when membership is gone, and the selfhosted relay fences an attach whose authority claim is below the channel's recorded floor. Pre-0281 tokens keep working during the rolling window and enforce nothing new.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ca75ed9: Add the governed-learning activation controller with exact authority revalidation, destination-native workspace activation, immutable content-free receipts, and supersession-safe append-only undo.
- c297fc0: Add permission-first Company Brain guidance, Knowledge, proposal, and content-free accepted-turn context inspection surfaces.
- c297fc0: Add permission-first Knowledge search selection facts, pre-window relevance floors, deterministic ranking, search/browse response budgets, exact textual-content deduplication, freshness-aware ordering, revision-fenced cursors, and authorization-rechecked document/chunk traversal links.
- c297fc0: Add the permission-filtered Company Brain read and deterministic OKF export
  surface, subject-scoped full guidance history, and the Company Brain discovery
  and export experience.
- c297fc0: Route derived Company Brain proposals through the immutable workspace learning-policy snapshot before destination admission.
  Add exact rooted Task-note to proposed workspace Knowledge promotion with immutable value-free provenance and replay-safe MCP tools.
  Add atomic Task-note correction/revert with immutable old/new lineage, strict attempt/version fencing, and replay-safe first-party tooling.
- e9aabaa: Wire the governed-learning evaluator and activation controller into the Company Brain learning-policy router. Ways-of-working proposals now record a content-free decision receipt after they commit; under `automatic`, an eligible preference decision is activated through the destination lifecycle (instruction policy keeps a human activation boundary). The route receipt gains `learning`, `learningFailure`, and activation receipt/destination facts; `activation.activated` is no longer always `false`.
- 1f860f0: Add durable publication and authenticated download support for session sandbox files. Agents can publish bounded `/workspace` outputs through a first-party tool, raw sandbox links can recover through the session API, retained file receipts render with downloads, and retained screenshots expose an explicit download action.
- c297fc0: Add atomic rooted Task-note promotion into inactive instruction-policy and
  preference proposals while preserving exact source evidence, replay identity,
  and human-only activation.
- 22c0c21: Add the managed-human organization invitation, role, suspension, offboarding,
  and retention lifecycle with revision-fenced APIs and SDK methods. Self
  invitation history is exposed only through bounded keyset pages, and acceptance
  resolves one exact subject-bound invitation. Already-open session,
  workspace-control, live, and interaction streams periodically recheck current
  membership authority and close after revocation. A bounded operator command
  commits expired offboarded personal database deletion together with a closed,
  exact-key cleanup-obligation set before deleting external objects. Provider
  failures retry only unfinished obligations, retained references abort before
  external bytes are touched, File bucket identity stays frozen across retries,
  and immutable lifecycle evidence survives cleanup.
- 4eb7abd: `remember` with `lane: knowledge` now returns `confirmation_required` bound to the Knowledge claim, and `remember_confirm` (`claimId`) approves the claim through the Knowledge review lifecycle after the exact initiating human answered the bound canonical question with `save` (rolling migration 0274, `confirm_remember_knowledge_claim`, immutable `remember_knowledge_confirmation_receipts`). `remember_confirm` accepts either `proposalId` + `decisionReceiptId` (preference / instruction policy) or `claimId` (knowledge); the confirm receipt carries `claimId` and a `knowledge` activation summary with `undo: knowledge_review`.
- 89d4ab3: Add the explicit user-directed `remember` / `remember_confirm` agent tools. Content becomes exact task-note evidence promoted through the learning-policy router; a preference activates immediately under `automatic`, Knowledge stays proposal-only, and everything else returns a bound `request_human_input` payload whose `save` answer authorizes activation through the new rolling migration 0272 `activate_human_confirmed_learning_decision` capability (`authority_kind = human_confirmed`, human-input request id recorded on the receipt).
- 7454580: Retire the legacy Memory V1 `memory_save` agent tool from the default retrieval-only surface: it is now compatibility-only, excluded from the default first-party tool catalog, and registered only when a workspace opts into the `legacy_standing` rollback mode. Agents save user-directed knowledge through `remember` and their own findings through task notes and governed promotion; `memory_search` and `memory_correct` remain.
- 16cbd7b: Make `retrieval_only` the default Company Brain memory prompt mode. An absent or unrecognized workspace `memoryPromptMode` now removes the broad Memory V1 standing block, excludes legacy preference-kind rows from agent search, and omits the company profile from child prompts; an explicit `legacy_standing` remains the per-workspace rollback opt-out. Rolling migration 0271 applies the same fallback at turn acceptance so frozen snapshots and the contracts resolver agree.
- 30ba620: Make every accepted scheduled agent occurrence an immutable, credential-free
  execution snapshot bound to one run, session, scheduled update, logical turn,
  and attempt chain. Agent tasks accept explicit `connectionAuthorities`
  (omitted preserves, `[]` clears, an array replaces), execution-affecting edits
  require the same causal human, `once` grants are consumed exactly once per
  run, cold reusable sessions converge on one revision-bound materialization
  receipt, and task deletion becomes a one-way paused tombstone with durable
  connector cleanup. Create/update requests are byte-bounded at ingress while
  stored rows stay readable. Migration `0275` is a maintenance cutover.
- d168b8f: Allow exact scheduled service turns to materialize organization- and workspace-scoped Variable Sets while preserving causal-human and personal-grant checks for user-scoped sets.
- f72563d: Slack now has exactly two authorities: the personal hosted Slack MCP grant and the OpenGeni workspace bot. The workspace-owned hosted Slack MCP connection is removed: OAuth start, reconnect, the callback fence, and capability enablement reject an explicit non-personal ownership for `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`, an omitted ownership on that resource defaults to personal, and `listEnabledMcpCapabilityServers` no longer runs a workspace-scoped Slack MCP installation enabled by an earlier release. The bot manifest and canonical bot allowlist gain the bot-token Real-time Search scopes `search:read.public`, `search:read.files`, and `search:read.users` as requested-but-not-required extras; apply them to the Slack app before deploying, since the install URL requests every requested scope. The bot search tool itself is a separate change.
- c297fc0: Complete governed goal rewrites with strict agent change metadata, immutable
  proposal rejection and CAS-fenced rollback, bounded revision pagination, and
  accepted-turn root constraints that child agents may inherit or narrow. The
  original raw-array goal-revision list remains unchanged; bounded pagination is
  available through a separately named API and SDK surface.
- c297fc0: Add deterministic governed-learning evaluation over exact accepted policy and evidence authority, with immutable content-free decision receipts and no activation capability.

### Patch Changes

- 91d5caf: Add a provider-neutral operational instruction contract for consistent agent collaboration, execution safety, file editing, and skill usage across every OpenGeni persona. Keep persistent system instructions prompt-cache stable, project goal continuations once as canonical user messages, let authoritative human input supersede a pending continuation, and remove the unreliable inferred-progress pause.
- 6860c5f: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private scopes for Rigs and Connected Machines. Personal machine use and Rig materialization now revalidate exact-attempt grants, membership, workspace access, authority epochs, and generations before runtime access.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c4e0b8: Add the workspace-bot Slack App Home task inbox with exact linked-user authorization, bounded active/attention/recent task projection, convergent `views.publish` refreshes, access-revocation clearing, and canonical manifest support.
- eeb7cb6: Add immutable personal/workspace connection authority contracts and immediate
  pre-use revalidation helpers.

### Patch Changes

- 90c0c3e: Persist bounded, content-free Company Brain prompt contribution estimates on authoritative model-call facts and expose their source breakdown and coverage in Workspace Insights.
- e0e0102: Unify browser, computer, identity, realtime, and Codemode behavior across managed sandboxes and connected machines.
- d7dfc01: Add typed workspace model-access policy reads and full-replacement updates for admin settings surfaces, plus a provider-private per-model policy verdict in the authenticated catalog.
- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- d34dd9a: Add revision-fenced per-command memory and CPU policies for Connected Machines, exact live runner capability gating, and lifecycle-safe Linux operation accounting without introducing default resource limits.
- c3f0598: Materialize authorized connector attachments as exact, hash-verified sandbox files while keeping provider bytes and private download URLs out of model, Codemode, and durable event output.
- d2f172c: Add fail-closed, metadata-only capability, exact rig-version health, exact alert-selector data-source checks, and source/claim authority fencing for scheduled incident telemetry responders before expensive retrieval.
- 04b1a1f: Add exact-attempt, workspace-local governed Knowledge proposal/correction
  routing and inactive instruction-policy and preference proposal adapters while
  preserving human activation authority and immutable Knowledge provenance.
- c056063: Project exact Integration Facet ownership so shared or externally managed bindings are read-only and direct removal reports retained owners truthfully.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 448117d: Enforce fresh per-object Google Drive ACL authorization across Knowledge
  retrieval and every file-byte consumer, and project only reauthorized,
  principal-free provider citations.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 083387e: Replace the removed per-turn `turnInstructions` system-prefix contract with generic per-message `modelContext` content. This is a breaking release-train cutover: old mutating clients are rejected after migration 0240. Context now enters canonical user history without standard timeline rendering, preserves the persistent prompt-cache prefix, and works across initial, queued, steer, realtime delegation, and transcript handoff paths.

### Patch Changes

- 11913b7: Add separately consented Google Drive editable-artifact publishing with an explicit writable destination, connector-action approval policy, Google-native conversion, and retry-safe provider reconciliation.

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- 478d7fe: Add explicit, bounded root-task-tree coordination note tools with exact-attempt authority, private-session visibility, expiry, immutable create/archive receipts, and safe retry semantics.
- 478d7fe: Add a reversible workspace memory prompt mode that removes the legacy standing memory block, keeps preference observations out of agent behavioral authority, contains company-profile context for child agents, and reports metadata-only model-context contribution telemetry.
- 478d7fe: Persist exact accepted-turn goal authority, separate semantic goal revisions
  from execution progress, and add policy-controlled rewrite proposals with API,
  SDK, MCP, and runtime support.

### Patch Changes

- d86610d: Prevent deterministic model-generated worker-spawn failures, hide exhausted nested-agent creation, and show bounded structured session orchestration diagnostics in worker timeline rows while preserving the advanced public REST/SDK create contract.
- d86610d: Show elapsed UTC-hour buckets for the Insights Today range while retaining UTC-day buckets for longer ranges.
- d86610d: Run published HTML artifacts as exact source in an opaque-origin sandbox, raise their UTF-8 ceiling to 4 MiB, and expose reusable React rendering. Add deployment-configurable default and allowed built-in session tools plus configured shared-key delegation fallback.
- 478d7fe: Add permission-first agent Knowledge search, exact fetch, and cursor-bounded browsing over authorized Documents.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- b0b2bed: Add unified browser and computer interaction APIs, reusable browser identities, native input, live streaming, and React viewer controls across managed sandboxes and connected machines.

## 0.48.0

### Minor Changes

- 8beed26: Add workspace-governed Slack shared-conversation task policies with durable enforcement and public contracts, and enforce vertical-only agent session authority across core and persistence.
- 8beed26: Add managed-human organization membership discovery. Expose the exact active
  self-membership and personal-workspace identity returned by the existing
  narrow provisioning capability through a managed-session-only API route and
  typed SDK method, while denying delegated/API-key principals and terminal
  memberships.

## 0.47.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace provider presets and nullable integration identities with immutable Integration Definitions. Curated and workspace-authored integrations now share one definition-based contract, provenance model, OAuth callback, SDK route, runtime projection, and maintenance migration with no legacy API alias or fallback authority.
- 1e78f58: Make Facet definitions and bindings authoritative throughout the Integration domain. Public routes, SDK methods, Pack components, owner identities, physical tables, persisted manifests, and runtime projections now use one Facet vocabulary with a maintenance cutover and no compatibility aliases.
- 746bbbe: Add canonical human identities with multiple verified login bindings, revisioned and audited lifecycle operations, immediate session invalidation, fail-closed recovery and collision handling, and metadata-minimal managed identity API routes.
- 9849e25: Add strict identifier-free xAI provider-account authority snapshots and durable
  SuperGrok/xAI multi-account persistence with live user authority revalidation,
  encrypted credential boundaries, fair exact-turn leases, pool-scoped pins,
  quota/cooldown metadata, capacity waiters, immutable accepted-work snapshots,
  FORCE RLS, and explicit runtime privilege posture.
- 1e78f58: Make normalized Plugin, Version, Skill Facet, and component-owner records authoritative for curated and imported Skills. Add reviewed library install, list, update, preview, and uninstall contracts; preserve Pack and Plugin ownership independently; and retire every non-MCP row from the generic capability catalog and installation ledger through a collision-free maintenance migration.

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d74340: Add the inert personal Codex provider-account authority foundation and opaque
  accepted-work snapshot contract without activating user-scoped consumption.

## 0.45.0

### Minor Changes

- d2def0c: Add the complete browser-native and semantic computer interaction system across managed sandboxes, Connected Machines, attached Chrome, and external browser placements. Ship durable browser identities, authentication repair, network routing, downloads/uploads, shared causal control, public SDK and React workbench surfaces, and one exact MCP/Codemode execution catalog with native Connected Machine access.
- 5215c0e: Add the first-party Fiken connector: a registered-app OAuth flow (`startFikenOAuth` + public callback, Basic-auth code exchange, broker-owned refresh with rotating refresh tokens) and a verified paste-a-token install route, both storing one workspace-owned `fiken.no` connection; explicit-only `fiken_*` first-party MCP tools (reads plus contact-create and idempotent invoice-draft-create); a serialized single-concurrent-request Fiken client; an `api:fiken` capability tile whose connect sheet leads with OAuth and folds the token form behind a toggle; and operator config `OPENGENI_FIKEN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`.
- 733c22f: Add the organization-tenancy foundation contracts and inert database scaffolding for organization memberships, user-owned resource authority and grants, personal retention, and generic session visibility, fork provenance, and authority epochs.

### Patch Changes

- d15d3e8: Repair the Slack reaction-task experience with initial-only session links, disabled link/media unfurls, workspace-service-principal delivery, conservative terminal-output coalescing, direct execution of safe specified requests, and bounded deterministic import of exact reacted-message PNG/JPEG/WebP attachments as reference-only workspace files. Preserve fail-closed provider-outcome reconciliation and keep generic model-facing posting unavailable without a trusted durable logical-delivery identity.

## 0.44.1

### Patch Changes

- b57d61f: Keep Codex image-tool schemas within the provider-supported regex subset and
  restore all bundled runtime skills to production API and worker process builds.
- 5c5ea4a: Add the universal capabilities platform with named API integration instances,
  provider-specific feature bindings, and local runtime adapters.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- aeb07f4: Add durable workspace decision publication to verified Slack bot channels with immutable configuration revisions, outbox attempts and receipts, bounded retries and terminal states, admin review/history UX, typed SDK methods, and a post-persistence governed-learning outcome adapter.

### Patch Changes

- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.
- ff7203c: Add a read-only Atlassian Jira and Confluence connector with shared OAuth setup, selected-source live agent search and reads, and optional governed knowledge synchronization.

## 0.43.0

### Minor Changes

- b46f4de: Add a compact, cursor-paginated agent-topology read surface with root, direct-child, and search filters for lazy hierarchy browsers.
- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.
- 31666e2: Add immutable workspace learning-policy revisions, lifecycle-only activation and rollback, accepted-attempt snapshots, and deterministic effective-mode resolution for `off`, `suggest`, and `automatic`.
- a858835: Add unambiguous Slack installation bindings and a token-free, subject-bound workspace access-request lifecycle for signed Slack identity links.

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- d55a093: Use truthful Google Drive read-only source-sync metadata for new connections while retaining compatibility with the legacy metadata-browser label.
- ad9123b: Pin the Slack reaction shortcut to the OpenGeni genie emoji across contracts and SDK types.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.
- 90eea29: Make connected-machine removal show every dependent session and support an explicit canonical move-to-default-sandbox confirmation before revocation. Default moves prove managed sandbox readiness through the existing fleet route, active turns remain fail-closed, and typed swap rejections surface as visible errors instead of false success.
- 5fcad0a: Expose an agent-safe checkpointed listing of newly indexed documents with source and provenance metadata.

## 0.42.1

### Patch Changes

- 2cd6dce: Build and reuse version-bound immutable provider images after clean rig verification, with content-hash invalidation and runtime-setup fallback for missing or unsupported providers.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 7b2d5ff: Add trust-gated in-session capability recommendations, human-owned authorization
  requests, and a GitHub owner-consent flow that returns to the initiating session.
- d1189ba: Add the OpenGeni-owned document, spreadsheet, and presentation authoring engine,
  its durable API/domain/live-sync surfaces, first-party React workbench, and
  editable-artifact client SDK. Publish independently lazy, identity-pinned browser
  WASM runtimes for each editor modality.

## 0.41.4

### Patch Changes

- ef78ecf: Separate credential-free capability discovery from exact, permission-checked live-plane grants; mint terminal credentials just in time, preserve first input across connection setup, and bound pre-open terminal memory.

## 0.41.3

### Patch Changes

- dfcf698: Enable Slack's hosted MCP surface in the generated app manifest with its full user-tool scope set.

## 0.41.2

### Patch Changes

- e2edfbc: Add provider-aware image generation with permanent verified artifacts,
  prompt-cache-safe history, sandbox materialization, and SDK/React rendering.

## 0.41.1

### Patch Changes

- 2727236: Make sandbox draining crash-safe with durable capture and teardown ownership, idempotent Modal snapshots, scoped operator holds, parallel Temporal reaping, exact lifecycle errors, and verified Local/Docker workspace recovery.

## 0.41.0

### Minor Changes

- bb9a346: Add token and cache coverage plus nullable provider-rate cost comparisons to Workspace Insights, preserving exact Gateway billing while keeping incomplete configured telemetry unpriced.

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- fed43cf: Make embedded Files and Changes durable and responsive: capture complete branch comparisons, batch file-frontier and multi-repository Git reads behind one sandbox lease, preserve live stream responsiveness during reconciliation, harden portable sandbox reads, and polish the workbench's file tree, resizable panes, machine/terminal states, and embedded composer geometry.

## 0.39.5

### Patch Changes

- 200586a: Allow workspace administrators to disable structured agent human-input requests while preserving ordinary user messages.

## 0.39.4

### Patch Changes

- 70ced80: Add an offline-safe Connected Machine enrollment removal lifecycle with credential revocation, durable audit history, guarded route and lease handling, SDK/MCP support, and accessible active-list reconciliation.

## 0.39.3

### Patch Changes

- 5d8bb99: Allow scheduled tasks to target and durably wake one authorized existing session without creating a helper session or replacing its goal.
- 34c5cdb: Retain validated computer screenshots as authenticated, integrity-checked session artifacts with bounded event/history receipts, SDK range assembly, and React rendering while preserving historical inline-image compatibility.

  Fence screenshot cleanup and quota accounting across parent deletion, duplicate settlement, expiry, compensation, and garbage-collection races so provider objects are deleted only after durable lifecycle ownership and quota is released exactly once.

## 0.39.2

### Patch Changes

- 7dbd057: Preserve provider-defined repository clone paths and centralize provider-declared `.git` alias semantics across resource identity and credential routing.
- 30a0b9a: Preserve internal content exactly, replace heuristic rewriting with lossless persistence, and keep public telemetry on reviewed structural projections.
- 23de73b: Add explicitly permissioned, audited plaintext reads for encrypted workspace variable-set values across REST, SDK, React, MCP, and UI surfaces.

## 0.39.1

### Patch Changes

- ce823ce: Replace first-party MCP mutation entity echoes with strict, versioned compact
  receipts; add bounded scheduled-task list/detail projections and preserve worker
  session references across receipt and legacy timeline results.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 6eb0b23: Add production resumable composer transcription with exact-subject durable
  manifests, idempotent SHA-256 chunk uploads, bounded ffmpeg segmentation, one
  recording-wide provider pin, persisted retryable segment results, deterministic
  assembly, cross-browser SDK recovery, object-ledger cleanup, and expiry purging
  of transcript metadata after every provider object is confirmed deleted. Legacy
  one-shot voice input remains compatible.

## 0.38.3

### Patch Changes

- c0f8e40: Prevent model-visible GitHub installation credential exposure and duplicate brokered MCP side effects after ambiguous 401 responses.

## 0.38.2

### Patch Changes

- 4502474: Add workspace-default and explicitly personal ownership for first-party social connections, preserve causal personal authority for agent work, and retain actionable structured gateway errors.

## 0.38.1

### Patch Changes

- c9d8b69: Make Connected Machine project paths portable and diagnosable: session responses now expose `workingDir`, and the native agent consistently supports the service user's `~` path across exec, filesystem, git, and terminal operations while reporting missing working directories accurately.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- bef5920: Add subject-scoped Workspace State preference and document-authority inventory
  metadata plus a canonical, explicitly sanitized export API and SDK method.

### Patch Changes

- b6e39fc: Polish session chrome and apply_patch rendering; clarify realtime voice-end handoff.

  SessionChrome gets denser selected-chip UX and Codex function-tool apply_patch shapes render in the specialized diff UI. Solo goal_continuation machine-input rows are suppressed in favor of the GoalRow landmark. The realtime transcript-tail instruction now keeps in-flight work going after voice ends.

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- fd13ba9: Add one immutable organization, workspace, or personal document destination contract for connector configuration, and make Google Drive persist and consume that authority independently from optional collections.

## 0.36.1

### Patch Changes

- abe0de6: Persist timesliced composer voice recordings in browser storage with reload-safe document ownership, opener/duplicate-tab fencing, oldest-first recovery, byte-ceiling enforcement, and durable transcript-before-draft handoff. Interrupted audio retries reuse the same recording, uncertain saved transcripts require explicit insertion instead of automatic retranscription or duplicate append, and transient handed-off cleanup failures are retried and garbage-collected owner-safely.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 00f7d3b: Add durable, tenant-isolated onboarding proposals that atomically create inactive instruction-policy drafts with typed replay, stale-baseline, conflict, and audit contracts, plus a bounded Workspace State admin composer.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- b121e7c: Add durable Google Drive pause, resume, disconnect, reconnect, revoked-token,
  removed-app, and permission re-consent lifecycle handling with version-fenced
  state transitions, generation-bound disconnect idempotency, stale-replay
  protection, and secret-safe provider error classification.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- b83af7a: Add replay-safe workspace instruction policy administration across the API,
  contracts, database, and SDK, including immutable operation receipts that reject
  changed requests reusing the same operation identifier.

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- d1f0c3d: Add immutable organization, workspace, and initiating-user personal authority to Documents and chunks; filter retrieval by exact account and authority before ranking; require exact account-admin authority for organization publication; and preserve authority through a drained API, worker, and indexing-workflow cutover.
- 1d0f2ae: Expose one effective document retrieval contract across REST, SDK, and MCP that binds the immutable initiating subject outside caller input, filters organization/workspace/personal authority before ranking, and preserves source plus authorization provenance in typed results.
- 3e4842d: Add subject-authorized accepted-attempt governance inspection to Workspace State,
  including immutable policy/preference snapshot metadata and deterministic current
  drift classification without exposing prompt or personal preference content.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- 13b961e: Add an atomic terminal session-subtree cancellation command that drains queued work, fences concurrent prompts and child creation, interrupts live attempts, durably reports cancelled children to surviving parents, and exposes the operation through the API/core/SDK control surface.
- e03397d: Freeze workspace instruction policies and structured preference descriptors at
  the accepted logical-turn boundary, add immutable per-session policy roles, and
  compose the resulting exact-attempt governance into agent and compaction prompts.
- 3baaebd: Add configurable Slack emoji-reaction summons with a least-privilege manifest, bounded thread context, and workspace-admin settings.

### Patch Changes

- ecc4288: Add a deterministic, fail-closed Google Drive OAuth scope-capability contract and
  require recursive selected-source read access before callback persistence or
  source browsing.
- 4f15920: Add an authorized, server-mediated connected-Codex GPT-Live V3 WebRTC SDP path with credential-safe negotiation and browser lifecycle helpers.

## 0.31.2

### Patch Changes

- e62495f: Allow session creators to explicitly opt out of a workspace default rig, and make live release acceptance prove its fixture command completed before waiting for a workspace capture.
- b4982fa: Expose GPT-5.6 Max reasoning end to end for managed and connected Codex models.

## 0.31.1

### Patch Changes

- 9c4d73d: Add curated OpenGeni-credit and workspace-key Vercel AI Gateway model paths for
  DeepSeek V4 Flash and Kimi K3, including exact provider routing, cache-aware
  pricing and metering, Responses tool continuity, provider-blind catalog UX, and
  stable remote-compaction cache prefixes.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b3e46f: Allow a digest-pinned capability-pack sandbox image to bind an immutable Modal image ID. OpenGeni now preserves the logical OCI digest on the lease, starts the provider-native image through `ModalImageSelector.fromId`, records the actual ID in the Modal session envelope, clears lower-precedence IDs when a rig overrides the image, and keeps catalog image metadata aligned with the runtime manifest.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 2321119: Add the provider-neutral scoped knowledge provenance, lifecycle, ACL, and normalized claim foundation for organization, workspace, and initiating-user personal evidence.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- dd71248: Make workspace-owned MCP OAuth connections the default, add explicit personal
  connection ownership, and preserve exact delegated personal authority across
  turns, child sessions, goals, schedules, retries, and recovery with safe
  tool-level degradation when a personal connection is unavailable.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 659b3ff: Harden Slack-triggered session delivery, identity linking, provider backoff, explicit connection-tool selection, and replay-safe bounded progress/final delivery.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0bc02: Add an opt-in browser analytics runtime contract with consent-gated, allowlisted
  Reo, PostHog, and GA4 provider configuration. Self-hosted deployments remain
  disabled by default, and public client configuration exposes no provider
  administrative credentials. Third-party modules load lazily, Reo clipboard/AI
  capture is disabled, query-bearing routes are excluded, and consent can be
  withdrawn without destabilizing the console.
- 5a4c559: Add first-party X and Reddit social connectors: OAuth connect flows (X PKCE
  S256, Reddit permanent grant) with encrypted token storage and just-in-time
  refresh, live first-party MCP tools (search, mentions, thread fetch, own-post
  sync, permission-gated reply publishing), a reddit provider in the marketing
  pack, operator config via OPENGENI_SOCIAL_OAUTH_CLIENTS_JSON, and SDK
  startSocialOAuth/listSocialConnections.

### Patch Changes

- d4d8960: Keep Personal Slack UI, reconnect, and broker credential selection on one deterministic legacy-duplicate ordering.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ec9912: Add generic, versioned workspace artifacts with content-addressed HTML storage, a static HTML/CSS renderer, rollback history, and first-party agent publishing tools. JavaScript and active or navigation-capable markup are removed from the initial renderer until executable artifacts have a stronger isolation boundary.

### Patch Changes

- dcc35c5: Add authenticated Slack mentions, commands, message shortcuts, atomically private bot-DM sessions, durable thread continuation, and globally bounded idempotent progress delivery.

## 0.26.1

### Patch Changes

- c52acc0: Ship Fast latency mode with turn-column inheritance, Codex ChatGPT honor-skip for response service_tier, and model picker UX polish.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- f413e6c: Add real Workspace Insights: durable `model_call_facts` after authoritative
  `agent.model.usage`, a `workspace:admin` insights API over usage_events + facts +
  live joins, SDK client, and a web console that drops mock rollups for honest
  UTC credit/token/cache/warm/caps reporting.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 42428a2: Add per-session Codex remote compaction v2 (`remote_v2` / `portable`), with UI landmarks, Codex-only model locking, and opaque token accounting aligned to Codex CLI.

### Patch Changes

- 0199108: Harden the workspace Slack bot with one fail-closed scope policy, deterministic legacy connection selection, and durable replay-safe message deletion operation identities.
- b2e975f: Advance the merged knowledge release train to fresh publication identities without changing runtime behavior. This corrective source is derived from current main and does not reuse generated release output.
- 9f3b931: Add the canonical personal Slack hosted-MCP resource constant and a dedicated account-linking experience that keeps subject-owned OAuth status, reconnect, and disconnect controls separate from workspace bot installation.

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- Add native voice-input contracts: `ClientConfig.voiceInput`, `WorkspaceVoiceInputSettings`,
  `TranscribeAudioResponse`, MIME/duration/size ceilings, and
  `resolveWorkspaceVoiceInputEnabled` (maps legacy `transcription.enabled` for one release).
  Expand transcription error codes with `unavailable` / `too_large` / `invalid_audio`.

## 0.24.3

### Patch Changes

- 710b081: Keep sessions usable when a previously selected MCP capability is disconnected or removed. Unavailable historical refs remain visible in effective policy but are omitted from executable tools, and the agent receives a bounded turn-level warning not to claim access to the missing source.

## 0.24.2

### Patch Changes

- 96eb64b: Advance the reviewed knowledge release package graph to fresh publishable identities after the previous version projection was invalidated. This changes release metadata only and does not alter runtime behavior.

## 0.24.1

### Patch Changes

- ddff8db: Add the read-only Workspace State inventory with bounded, authorization-scoped
  Documents aggregates and a deterministic metadata-only Memory projection. The
  projection explicitly labels legacy `knowledge_memories` preference-kind counts
  as non-authoritative observations while preserving the structured preference
  registry as the sole active preference authority.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f6f13f: Add the isolated, versioned organization/workspace/user preference registry,
  including audited proposal and activation flows, deterministic attempt-bound
  descriptors, authorized full-content retrieval, REST/MCP tools, and SDK types.
  Attempt reads revalidate current generation and immutable-human authority in one
  locked transaction; lifecycle writes use scope-version CAS and database-owned
  audit functions that prevent direct head mutation or history erasure. Snapshot
  creation is database-canonical and lifecycle governance requires a signed
  `human_session` principal; expiry filtering and supersession are transactionally
  enforced before bounds or terminal mutation.

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

## 0.23.1

### Patch Changes

- ad0bdc3: Surface managed-credit admission rejections with actionable composer recovery guidance while preserving drafts and attachments, and canonicalize default attachment mounts across established-session draft admission and replay.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 33dc88f: Restore managed GitHub App installation with OAuth-first existing-installation
  discovery, exact owner revalidation, and hosted/operator setup-mode separation.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 1c4018e: Replace one-turn tool overrides with one durable session tool policy, expose
  OpenGeni-native tools in the same selection, default available tools on, and
  render delivered machine inputs as compact typed timeline updates instead of
  raw protocol JSON.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 29ad09b: Persist typed machine inputs into canonical model history at turn claim, expose
  authoritative pending-input queue projections and lifecycle events, render
  delivered batches in the timeline, and preserve append-only prompt-cache
  prefixes across tools, later turns, recovery, and explicit compaction.

### Patch Changes

- dfc3235: Separate first-party MCP authorization from exact per-session tool visibility, add fail-closed registration policy, and isolate file download URLs on the files MCP surface.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 519d93c: Add validated inline per-session skills and discover skills directly from already-materialized repository resources.

## 0.20.2

### Patch Changes

- 110bb77: Enforce exact-subject ownership for personal OAuth capabilities and add secure direct OAuth installation for the separate workspace OpenGeni Slack bot.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- ffd246c: Keep workspace-capture Git status, diffs, and untracked files below provider retained-output limits, and publish an explicit degraded revision instead of an authoritative empty diff when repository reads fail.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 06a5801: Add the backend workspace instruction-policy revision, activation, rollback, audit, API, and SDK control surface.
- 5511c24: Add a secure workspace-shared OpenGeni Slack bot connection with schema-backed verified-install eligibility, immutable team/bot identity across reinstall, idempotent post-operation convergence, exact scope validation, first-party channel/history/user/post tools, explicit scheduled-task routing and rebinding, and install/reinstall/recovery UI and documentation.

## 0.19.4

### Patch Changes

- 9a8f793: Add fail-closed GitHub personal/organization owner authority proofs, audited
  workspace installation bindings with explicit repository allowlists, and
  truthful disabled/unbound/bound lifecycle contracts.
- c135339: Persist safe new-session defaults after successful creates while preserving explicit tool-policy semantics and revalidating stale workspace resources before reuse.

## 0.19.3

### Patch Changes

- a0f2442: Return typed correlation-safe API failures, discard bounded non-JSON gateway bodies in the SDK, preserve retryability and ambiguous mutation outcomes, and keep composer drafts stable across transient failures and live policy rerenders.

## 0.19.2

### Patch Changes

- 85cb323: Restore provider-native web search for workspace-default Codex sessions while preserving explicit
  tool narrowing, child policy ceilings, version-fenced policy adoption, and structured URL citations.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- de20184: Redact known runtime credentials and recognized authorization, cookie, signed
  URL, assignment, and provider-token shapes before model calls, durable session
  history, events, logs, and telemetry. Disable credential-bearing shell xtrace
  and raw Agents SDK model, tool, and MCP transport payload logging.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- 744a93d: Add default-off, bounded adaptive Codex fleet decision telemetry with strict deterministic replay, cache-aware and work-conserving policy simulation, secret-safe event/UI observability, and independent future policy gates.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

### Patch Changes

- bdd531c: Make Codex subscription response timeouts recoverable without blindly replaying partially observed model work. The transport now assigns a durable request identity, records attempt-fenced start/headers/first-byte/terminal metadata, enforces explicit headers, stream-idle, and whole-request deadlines, and retries once only before any response is observed. Exhausted or partial-stream timeouts retain a typed failure class and return the durable session to its existing retryable recovery path instead of hard-failing it with the opaque OpenAI SDK `Request timed out.` error. External cancellation remains authoritative, the SDK retry budget remains disabled, and Codex subscription turns keep their existing zero-credit billing path.

## 0.17.3

### Patch Changes

- 524599e: Normalize model, provider, upstream deployment, credential source, billing,
  capability, health, and pricing identity; expose a secret-safe authenticated
  workspace catalog with separate fail-closed credential readiness for federated
  providers; and persist the accepted model/reasoning execution policy on new
  logical turns.

## 0.17.2

### Patch Changes

- 4966649: Add bounded authoritative terminal-result projections to session event monitoring APIs and SDK types.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- ff23da5: Keep oversized event previews bounded while optionally linking them to integrity-addressed workspace-file evidence, and expose access-controlled metadata plus capped provider-native range retrieval through the API and SDK.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- b9cec61: Let embedding hosts return exact HTTPS smart-Git broker transports for repository
  bindings whose provider credentials cannot be contained to the selected
  repositories. Keep broker bearers off manifests, Git configuration, repository
  metadata, and provider CLIs; renew bearers independently without changing the
  admitted route set.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f84cc9: Add durable host-provided per-turn instructions, headless structured-input hooks, host-local queue
  focus, and reusable approval and human-input surfaces for embedded session consumers.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 136227e: Add an immutable, versioned curated skill library with explicit workspace selection and inspectable provenance, and preserve WCAG AA contrast for dark-theme primary actions.
- 3aee519: Add a workspace-accepted, provider-agnostic transcription policy and host-adapter contract, plus an accessible composer microphone that keeps partials ephemeral and appends non-empty accepted finals to the editable draft exactly once. Policies explicitly accept automatic language detection and speaker diarization, events can carry strict neutral result metadata, pending starts and cleanup are abortable/bounded, and adapter failures stay behind controlled UI copy with redacted non-UI diagnostics.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 32011f1: Add an optional durable host event and usage export for embedded deployments: source-transactional bounded snapshots, immutable turn attribution and session-root lineage, named at-least-once checkpoints, multi-replica leases, replay and retention controls, explicit poison-record disposition, an isolated exporter database role, and a worker delivery pump. Standalone deployments keep capture disabled until a host registers a sink.
- 3983021: Bind every host Git credential request to immutable session, root-session, turn,
  attempt, execution-generation, and initiator authority. The worker fails closed
  when a host broker is configured without that authority and preserves the same
  authority across identity resolution, lazy provisioning, and proactive renewal.
- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- 1f9305b: Add a host-owned session authorization port for embedded deployments. The port
  receives server-resolved root lineage and live agent-attempt authority, scopes
  session listing inside database queries, distinguishes exact from whole-tree
  projection access, gates HTTP/core/first-party MCP/Toolspace surfaces, and
  periodically reauthorizes idle SSE streams while standalone deployments retain
  their existing behavior when the port is unset.
- 8c66185: Let agent-created child sessions inherit omitted repository, MCP tool, and
  per-session MCP server context from their trusted immediate parent. Explicit
  arrays remain authoritative, mixed Git providers and multiple bindings are
  preserved, and credential headers are copied only as encrypted ciphertext.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 44ff327: Fence queue, composer, and control hook state to the active workspace and session so target switches cannot expose or accept stale private state.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0697a: Ship the production-hardened captured workspace workbench, physically verified Steer/Pause cancellation across cloud, local, and self-hosted model tools, pre-model preparation, sandbox provisioning, and lifecycle/setup commands, durable quiescence admission fencing, cancellation-aware SDK reads and turn cleanup, single-round-trip pruned workspace indexing, truthful shutdown states, a responsive and accessible review dock, Unicode coverage, and package-safe CSS/SSR integration.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.

### Patch Changes

- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b125213: Proactively renew GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps credentials during multi-day managed-sandbox turns, atomically replacing stable token files without model action or manifest mutation.
- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- 3148404: Add the `machine.op.failed` and `machine.op.recovered` session-event types for Connected Machine op-outcome observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's out-of-band plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics: `machine.op.failed` fires for infrastructure fault classes only (offline, draining-exhausted, payload-too-large, reconnecting-timeout, OS/stream/protocol) — never for a semantic miss the model asked about (a missing path, a consent gate, a nonzero exit); `machine.op.recovered` is the quiet healed-fault leading indicator. Both project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item), mirrored in the SDK event-type list.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ca067f: ClientConfig gains optional `serverVersion` (the release-train version baked into official server images, surfaced on /healthz and /v1/config/client); the unused `PageInfo`/`paginated()` exports are removed — list endpoints deliberately return bare arrays, and the events route's cursor scheme is the documented exception.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 15deca0: Add per-session third-party MCP servers with write-only encrypted headers, metadata-only responses/events, `mcp_servers:attach` permission gating, and per-message credential rotation.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 548e307: Republish contracts so the registry version carries the current export surface (`MintEnrollTokenRequest` and the machines/enroll types) that `@opengeni/api-router@0.2.x` imports — the previously published 0.3.0 predates them.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
