# Credential taxonomy

Audience: integrators and operators. One page for every credential the system
mints or accepts — what it is, who issues it, where it travels, and who may see
it. If you are deciding *which* credential to use: an external product backend
uses an **organization API key**; hosts acting on behalf of their own users use
a **delegated token**; everything else is machinery you receive from OpenGeni
rather than choose. The canonical product boundary is in
[`product-integration.md`](product-integration.md).

| Credential | Prefix / transport | Issued by | Verified by | Lifetime | Intended holder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment access key | `x-opengeni-access-key` header | Operator (env) | API perimeter middleware | Static | Ordinary callers and deployment-only surfaces of a key-gated deployment (coarse perimeter, not identity) |
| Organization API key | `ogk_…` bearer | Organization key administration via `POST /v1/organizations/:organizationId/api-keys` | Hash lookup (stored hashed, shown once) plus organization/workspace authorization | Until expiration or revocation | An external product backend calling organization-workspace routes; never a browser or Personal workspace |
| Workspace API key | `ogk_…` bearer | Authorized caller via `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/api-keys` | Hash lookup plus exact workspace authorization | Until expiration or revocation | A backend or automation constrained to one organization workspace |
| Delegated access token | `ogd_…` bearer; domain-bound `ogd2_…` when it asserts service provenance | Host with the deployment's delegation secret (HMAC) | HMAC + embedded workspace/account/permissions | Short (embedded expiry) | An embedding host acting as one of its users; also self-minted internally for first-party MCP |
| Managed web session | Better Auth cookie | Managed auth (email/password) | Better Auth session lookup | Session | Humans in the hosted web console |
| Browser session-set authority | Opaque 43-character `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie; hash-only at rest | Session-set API | Hash lookup plus CSRF, generation, actor-epoch, and exact-origin admission | 30-day idle / 180-day absolute | One managed browser installation; never browser JavaScript |
| Isolated login transaction | Path-scoped `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie; hash-only at rest | Session-set API after explicit add/re-auth | One-use transaction plus exact expected slot/identity/binding revisions | 10 minutes | The same-origin credential popup only |
| Stream token | `ogs_…` (query/header) | API, on viewer/stream mint | HMAC, scope+TTL embedded | Minutes | Browsers attaching to desktop/terminal streams |
| Machine enrollment bearer | `oge_…` | Enrollment flow (click-Grant or device flow) | HMAC + active enrollment row + exact credential generation | 30 days; generation-rotated on every re-enrollment | A self-hosted/connected machine agent |
| Headless enrollment token | `oget_…` | Operator via enrollment API | One-time exchange for `oge_…` | Single use | Provisioning scripts for headless machines |
| Relay producer token | `ogr_…` | API for self-hosted relay producers | HMAC | Short | The relay forwarding desktop frames |
| NATS user JWT / callout | NATS credentials | API auth-callout service | NATS server (callout account) | Connection | Machine agents and internal services on the message bus |
| Session MCP headers | Arbitrary headers, authenticated-encrypted at rest | Embedding host per session (`mcpServers` on create; rotatable per user turn) | Worker-side decrypt for execution; ordinary projections are metadata-only. Dedicated tenant-scoped `secrets:read` with metadata-only audit is an approved release-held follow-up, not part of the current emergency head | Host-defined; version-bumped on rotation | Host's own MCP server called from a session |
| Capability MCP headers | Arbitrary headers, authenticated-encrypted at rest | Workspace admin when configuring a capability | Worker-side decrypt for execution; ordinary projections are metadata-only. Dedicated tenant-scoped `secrets:read` with metadata-only audit is an approved release-held follow-up, not part of the current emergency head | Until reconfigured | Third-party MCP servers enabled workspace-wide |
| Codex subscription tokens | ChatGPT access/refresh/id tokens, encrypted | Device-code login flow in Workspace or Organization settings | OpenAI; OpenGeni stores encrypted, never returns them | Provider-defined, auto-refreshed | One workspace pool, or one organization pool inherited by current and future shared workspaces; personal workspaces remain local |
| Organization Vercel AI Gateway / OpenRouter keys | Provider API key, encrypted | Organization settings → Models | Organization provider account; OpenGeni never returns the key | Until rotated or disconnected | One organization connection per provider inherited by current/future shared workspaces; Personal workspaces remain local; workspace-only connections remain independent |
| Git credential-binding secret | Contained GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps provider token, or host smart-Git broker bearer | OpenGeni or embedding host per repository binding | Git provider or host HTTPS smart-Git broker | Provider/host-defined, independently renewed during active managed-sandbox turns | Sandbox git operations; direct provider tokens may also reach the matching provider CLI, while broker bearers are Git-only (delivered via hashed binding files, never baked into manifests/config/remote URIs) |
| Personal GitHub Git broker bearer | Encrypted opaque `oggh1.…` password used only by Git smart HTTP | OpenGeni worker from an exact accepted personal repository snapshot | OpenGeni API broker plus live connection/repository/provider revalidation | Five minutes, proactively renewed without changing routes | One active managed-sandbox attempt; delivered through private editor/file ingress, never provider CLIs, Connected Machines, model context, manifests, remotes, argv, logs, events, or audit text |
| Host run credentials | Provider-neutral environment values and credential files | Embedding host through `ConnectionCredentialsPort.runCredentials`, or a standalone product through the workspace credential provider (`docs/workspace-integrations.md`) | Upstream cloud/service CLIs and SDKs | Host-defined, proactively renewed during the active attempt | Agent commands and session-scoped Channel-A terminal processes; never the box-global shared `ttyd` process |
| Sandbox Codemode bearer | Narrow `ogd_…`; protected attempt file via `OPENGENI_CODEMODE_TOKEN_FILE` on managed boxes, direct `OPENGENI_CODEMODE_TOKEN` only in an exact Connected Machine child exec | OpenGeni worker from first-party signing authority | Exact-attempt Codemode API | One hour per bearer, proactively renewed during the active attempt | `@opengeni/codemode`/`ogtool` on managed sandboxes; native `opengeni-agent codemode` or an installed client in Connected Machine commands. Group-global ttyd and stable machine state receive no bearer |
| Signed storage URLs | Time-limited URL | API via object storage | Storage provider | Minutes | File upload/download without exposing storage credentials |

Rules that hold across the table:

- **Organization keys stay on the product server.** List, create, and revoke
  them through the organization API-key control plane. The create response
  shows the token once. An organization API key may be used only with
  organization workspaces (wire `kind: "shared"`) authorized by its grant;
  Personal workspaces are excluded. Store the token in a secret manager, map
  product tenants to opaque workspace ids, and proxy browser operations through
  the product backend. See [`product-integration.md`](product-integration.md).

- **Ambiguous legacy account keys are revoked on upgrade.** Migration 0382
  marks historical null-workspace keys without explicit organization provenance
  as `legacy_account` and revokes them so a pre-change API instance cannot keep
  accepting them during a rolling deployment. Reissue the integration through
  the organization API-key control plane; do not reuse a legacy token.

- **Managed browser slots do not expose provider credentials.** In `dual` and
  `broker`, a safe browser projection names bounded slot display metadata and one
  selected actor. Unselected Better Auth sessions remain server-side; add/re-auth
  strips ambient cookies before provider authentication; the opener receives only
  a transaction UUID and rereads authority. See
  [`browser-login-session-sets.md`](browser-login-session-sets.md).

- **Configured-secret authority is explicit.** Secret values are authenticated-
  encrypted at rest and never appear in unrelated list/detail/event/log/span
  projections. The approved release-held follow-up adds dedicated
  tenant-scoped `secrets:list|read|write` operations (plus the owning resource
  permission) and metadata-only access audit records containing reference/name,
  actor, session context, action, and timestamp, never the value. Those exact-
  value endpoints are not implemented in the current emergency head. Provider-
  owned token types without a product contract remain non-readable rather than
  being folded into a generic secret dump.
- **Rotation over longevity.** Rotating credentials are never stored in
  long-lived artifacts such as sandbox manifests. Git provider tokens and
  smart-Git broker bearers are delivered at setup and proactively re-minted by
  the worker throughout an active managed-sandbox turn, independently per
  binding. Host run credentials are replaced by immutable
  generations and renewed throughout the exact active attempt. The active and
  immediately previous host generation are retained for one-rotation process
  overlap; new processes always source the active pointer. Session MCP bearers
  are resolved at request time. Sandbox Codemode bearers are re-signed with the
  same frozen session/run authority. Managed sandboxes atomically replace the
  stable token file; Connected Machines update only the worker's in-memory cell,
  so the next child exec receives the new value while an existing process keeps
  its launch value.
- **Sandbox git auth is pointer-based and binding-scoped.** The manifest carries stable paths such
  as `OPENGENI_GIT_CREDENTIALS_DIR` and `OPENGENI_GIT_TOKEN_FILE`, while the
  worker/runtime seed current token values into files inside the sandbox.
  Binding ids are SHA-256-derived before entering filenames. Git selects by
  protocol + host + path. A host smart-Git transport rewrites only its exact
  selected remotes through a credential-free HTTPS broker URI; the bearer never
  enters Git configuration or repository metadata. `gh`, `glab`, and `az`
  select direct provider credentials by an explicit binding, current `origin`,
  or an unambiguous sole binding. They never receive a smart-Git broker bearer
  and instead direct the agent to configured provider MCP tools. Provider
  aliases exist only for a single direct binding. Renewal atomically replaces
  each binding file, so a multi-day turn sees current credentials without model
  action or manifest mutation and a failed sibling refresh cannot overwrite it;
  broker route changes require a newer admitted turn.
- **The perimeter is not identity.** The deployment access key admits ordinary
  callers and deployment-only surfaces. A cryptographically valid first-party
  delegated bearer may instead enter `/v1`; the normal access resolver still
  enforces its account, workspace, subject, permission, and live-attempt scope.
  Perimeter admission never grants workspace authority.
- **Machine revocation is bounded, not a claimed synchronous disconnect.** A DB
  revoke immediately denies the next NATS authorization/reconnect. A connection
  that already holds a callout-minted user JWT may remain live until that JWT
  expires; the control plane caps that residual interval at five minutes. A
  healthy agent treats that expiry as scheduled credential rotation and
  reconnects immediately with its durable enrollment bearer; it does not add
  outage backoff or stop established op-stream commands. A
  re-enrollment atomically advances the row's credential generation, so the old
  `oge_` bearer can neither authenticate nor self-revoke the new generation.
