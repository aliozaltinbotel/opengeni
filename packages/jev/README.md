# `@opengeni/jev`

`@opengeni/jev` holds OpenGeni's client for TypeSafe Jev, a fast judge model, and the Jev-ranked
`code_search` engine behind the worker's `code_search` agent tool. The package has no runtime
dependencies. It uses global `fetch`, runs under Node 18+ and Bun, and makes no filesystem or process
calls of its own.

## Jev client

```ts
const jev = new JevClient({ apiKey });
const r = await jev.ask(state, { urgent: noul("Does this convey urgency?") }, { signal });
r.answers.urgent.probability; // 0..1
r.costUsd; // $0.042 per 1M input tokens; output is free
```

The client calls `POST {baseUrl}/v1/systemone` with `{state, model, questions}`. When the state plus
the longest question would exceed 32k tokens, or the state plus all questions would exceed 64k tokens,
it splits the questions across several requests. It runs those requests concurrently (16 at a time by
default) and merges the answers.

Answers are normalized as follows:

- A noul answer becomes `{type: "noul", probability}`.
- A choice answer becomes `{type: "choice", option, probabilities?, confidence?}`.
- A score answer is passed through unchanged.

Retries and errors work like this:

- The client retries only network errors (including the per-attempt timeout), HTTP 429 and 5xx. The
  backoff is bounded, and a `retry-after` hint is honoured up to `maxRetryAfterMs` (2 s by default).
- `JevUnavailableError` covers network errors, timeouts, 5xx, 429 after the last retry, and 401, 402
  or 403 (auth or billing, never retried). `status` carries the HTTP status.
- `JevRequestError` covers every other 4xx (including `400 max_tokens_exceeded`) and a state too large
  to fit the limits (`code: "state_too_large"`). These are never retried.
- The caller's `AbortSignal` cancels queued and in-flight requests, and the call rejects with the
  signal's reason.

`JevCircuitBreaker` is an in-process breaker, and the worker keeps one per process:

- 3 consecutive `JevUnavailableError`s open it for 5 minutes. If the failure that opens it is a 401,
  402 or 403, it opens for 30 minutes instead.
- `tryAcquire()` returns a lease (`{id, trial}`) for each admitted call, or `null` when it refuses the
  call. The caller settles the lease exactly once, with `recordSuccess(lease)`,
  `recordFailure(error, now, lease)` or `release(lease)` (the call never reached Jev).
- After the cooldown the breaker is half-open, and `tryAcquire()` admits one trial call at a time.
  Others are refused until the trial ends or has run for 10 minutes. That is longer than one Jev
  retry cycle at the largest allowed request timeout (3 attempts of 120 s), plus backoff and sandbox
  recall, so a slow trial is not mistaken for a stuck one.
- A success from any call closes the breaker, and an unavailable failure from any call counts. While
  half-open, one more unavailable failure reopens it at once.
- `release()` and other errors neither count nor reset the streak. They end the trial only when their
  lease is the trial's, so a call admitted while closed cannot free the slot of a trial running now.
  Leases are matched by identity.
- `isOpen()` and `status()` are for metrics and diagnostics. Never use them to decide which tools a
  turn is offered: the tool list is part of the model's cached prompt prefix, and a breaker is
  per process, so tools that come and go with it break the provider's prompt cache.

## code_search

`runCodeSearch({question, keywords, subQuestions?, paths?, workspace, jev, signal?, budgetTokens?})`
is scout-0.4. It keeps the recall, triage and verification defaults of the validated research tool
scout-0.3.1, and adds the stages that let an agent read less irrelevant code without reading less relevant code.
The pipeline:

1. **Recall:** one ripgrep pass over the keyword variants, then IDF scoring per file.
2. **Wave 1:** Jev triages the candidate files, with a lexical guard that keeps the top lexical files.
3. **Symbols** (in parallel with wave 2): Jev judges a shortlist of the identifiers that the selected
   files declare, import, call or render. For the chosen ones, one ripgrep pass finds definitions and
   usages, and the files they lead to join the evidence.
4. **Wave 2:** Jev verifies line-numbered passages, including coverage of each sub-question.
   - The most relevant small files are tiled whole, so every declaration is judged.
   - A "must change together" question covers up to 60 functions of the top files, each shown by its
     signature and the calls it makes.
5. **Wave 3:** Jev scores one round of leads (definitions named by the evidence). It verifies the chosen
   definitions, up to 3 call sites per lead, and the symbol windows in one round.
6. **Pack:** the verified passages are packed within the token budget (12,000 by default).
   - Small relevant files are shown whole, and nearby passages are joined.
   - Import-only spans rank lower.
   - Each sub-question's best passage comes first, even when that sub-question is weak.
   - One Jev check sets the evidence rating. A low rating follows more leads once, and a middling one
     refills the budget.
7. **Footer:** the relevant files with the line ranges and declarations the pack did not show, then every
   limit that cut something (files, regions, passages, identifiers, call sites, the budget), then leads
   not followed and keywords that matched nothing or only irrelevant files, with similar real
   identifiers.

`text` is the rendered pack. Its first line is a status header such as
`code_search: evidence rating 0.55 (s1 0.81) | 9 passages from 6 files, ~7.9k tokens | 3.1s`.
`status` gives the label and scores, and `stats` gives wall time, stage times, counts, workspace calls
and Jev requests, tokens and cost.

A Jev failure makes the whole search throw. There is no keyword-only fallback, because it lowered
answer quality in the study. The one exception is a failure of the final sufficiency check: the
fully Jev-scored pack is still returned, with `evidence rating unknown (check failed)` and the
error in `statusCheckError`.

### Workspace contract

All file and process access goes through `CodeSearchWorkspace`: `ripgrep`, `readText` and
`pathKinds`, all with workspace-relative paths.

The engine passes ripgrep only these flags, so an adapter can enforce an allowlist: `--files`,
`--null`, `--line-number`, `--with-filename`, `--no-heading`, `--color never`, `-i`, `-w`,
`--no-require-git`, `--hidden`, `-m N`, `--max-columns N`, `--max-filesize N`, `-g GLOB` and
`-e PATTERN`. These are followed by `--` and then `.` or workspace-relative paths.

A pattern is at most `CODE_SEARCH_MAX_PATTERN_CHARS` (16,000) characters. The engine splits a longer
keyword union or definition search into several ripgrep calls, runs 4 at a time and merges their
output, so the result is the same as one call.

If ripgrep output is `truncated` or `timedOut`, the search continues with what it got, and the header
reports it, for example `code_search (partial search: ...)`.

An adapter reports problems as follows:

- `readText` returns `null` for a missing file. Per-file problems should also be returned as `null`
  rather than thrown.
- An adapter throws `CodeSearchWorkspaceError` when the workspace is unreachable. When ripgrep is
  missing, it throws `CodeSearchRipgrepMissingError`, or a `CodeSearchWorkspaceError` whose message
  says ripgrep is not installed.
- ripgrep exit code 2 with no output counts as no match for the file listing and the searches. That is
  what ripgrep returns when nothing matched and some path was unreadable. Only an invalid pattern
  still fails.

### Tool surface

The package exports the pieces the worker needs to register the tool:

- `CODE_SEARCH_TOOL_NAME`, `CODE_SEARCH_TOOL_DESCRIPTION` and `codeSearchInputSchema`.
- `parseCodeSearchArguments`, which trims, dedupes and normalizes paths, and rejects absolute paths,
  `..` and unknown keys.
- `renderCodeSearchError`, which turns a failure into short model-facing text.

### Changes from scout-0.3.1

- scout-0.4 adds symbol discovery, whole-file tiling, the change-together judgment, call sites of leads, the adaptive pack and the gap-reporting footer (above). `.opengeni/` sandbox state is never searched.

- There is no lexical judge and no whole-run lexical fallback.
- There are no Jev caches, file traces, CPU accounting or CLI. The optional `onStage` callback
  replaces the trace.
- The header names `code_search` instead of `scout`, and the footer notes say "paths" instead of `-p`.
- Truncated or timed-out ripgrep output is reported in the header.
- File reads and binary checks run in parallel (8 at a time) through the workspace. Selecting
  candidates gives the same result as the original sequential scan.
- ripgrep patterns over 16,000 characters are split into several calls with the same merged result.
- A file that reads shorter than ripgrep saw it, or not at all (for example UTF-16), no longer fails
  the search. Hits and lead definitions past its end are skipped.

## Tests

```bash
bun test ./packages/jev/test
```

The tests use a fixture repository, a `LocalCodeSearchWorkspace` (local `rg` via `Bun.spawn`, with the
ripgrep allowlist enforced) and a deterministic fake Jev. They never call the real API.
