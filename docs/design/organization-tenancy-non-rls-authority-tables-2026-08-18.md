# Non-RLS authority tables: can cross-organization denial move into the database?

Status: **three reasoned exemptions, one of them permanent by construction**

## The question

Every content table in Opengeni — sessions, documents, connections, knowledge,
variable sets, rigs — is FORCE RLS and genuinely isolated: a query running under
organization B's context cannot read organization A's row, full stop.

Three tables are not. `workspaces`, `workspace_memberships`, and
`auth_identities` carry an `account_id`, grant the runtime role full
`SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`, and have no row-level security at all. They sit in
`NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES` (`packages/db/src/runtime-posture.ts`) with the comment
that "their access model is implemented by the authentication/access layer or by
exact global keys."

That is a deliberate decision. But the organization-tenancy acceptance criteria say cross-organization
access is denied *at every surface*, and "every surface" reads as including the
database. This record decides the question explicitly instead of letting the
exemption be inherited silently.

**It does not change any authorization behaviour.** No RLS was enabled, no policy
was added to these three tables, and no query was rewritten. What shipped
alongside it is attestation only: `packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`
pins the exemption's exact shape so a future widening has to be deliberate.

## Verdict per table

| Table | Is an `account_id = current_account_id()` predicate feasible? | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaces` | **No — self-referential.** The predicate's input is produced by a query against the table the predicate would guard. | Permanent exemption |
| `workspace_memberships` | **No as an unconditional predicate.** The central authorization query derives the account from this table. A bootstrap escape hatch is possible but degenerates to today's posture, and three dormant policies make enabling RLS actively dangerous. | Exemption, revisit only with a redesigned context bootstrap |
| `auth_identities` | **Malformed question.** Its `account_id` is not a tenant id, and its queries do not run on a connection that can carry an Opengeni GUC. | Permanent exemption; also correct the table's description |

### `workspaces` — the circularity is one function

`opengeni_private.current_account_id()` reads the `opengeni.account_id` GUC.
`setRlsContext` (`packages/db/src/database.ts`) refuses to run without a non-empty
account id — deliberately, because an empty account silently returns zero rows
from every scoped read. So the account id must come from somewhere, and for the
whole workspace-scoped wrapper family it comes from here:

```ts
export async function rlsContextForWorkspace(db, workspaceId) {
  const [row] = await db
    .select({ accountId: schema.workspaces.accountId })
    .from(schema.workspaces)
    .where(eq(schema.workspaces.id, workspaceId))
    .limit(1);
  if (!row) throw new Error(`Workspace not found: ${workspaceId}`);
  return { accountId: row.accountId, workspaceId };
}
```

This runs on the bare handle with zero GUCs set, on every `withWorkspaceRls`,
`withWorkspaceSubjectRls`, `withWorkspaceSessionActivityRls`,
`withWorkspaceUsageLock`, and retry wrapper — roughly 750 call sites across
`packages/` and `apps/`. Under an `account_id = current_account_id()` policy the
GUC is unset, the predicate evaluates to `NULL`, the row disappears, and the
function throws `Workspace not found` for every workspace in the deployment.

The predicate would be self-defeating, not merely inconvenient. It is the query
that *produces* the value it would be checked against.

Other reads that would break for the same reason, before considering the
bootstrap: `bootstrapWorkspace`'s external-key lookup (pre-`setRlsContext`),
`getWorkspace`/`requireWorkspace` (unwrapped, and the source of the 404-vs-403
distinction in `packages/core/src/access/index.ts`), and
`listWorkspacesForSubject` (cross-account by intent — it powers `GET /v1/workspaces`).

Separately, several paths are cross-account *by design* and would break even with
a correctly-set account GUC: the deployment-global
`list_sandbox_viewer_force_drain_workspaces()` scan that drives the sandbox
reaper, `countWorkspacesForAccount` behind billing limits, the organization
inventory seam, and the organization-membership lifecycle's org-wide workspace
walks during suspend/offboard.

A bootstrap escape hatch — say a `session_visibility_write_capabilities`-style
capability, or a policy branch admitting a context-free read of exactly
`(id, account_id)` — is technically constructible. But the only column an
attacker gains from `workspaces` is workspace metadata, and the escape hatch
would have to admit precisely the read that leaks it. The predicate would be
decoration.

### `workspace_memberships` — same shape, plus a live trap

`getWorkspaceGrant` is the central authorization query. It joins
`workspace_memberships` to `workspaces`, on the bare handle, inside no wrapper,
with no GUC, and returns `accountId: row.workspace.accountId`. Everything
downstream in the request uses that account. It is called from
`accessGrantAuthorization` on every request whose `AccessContext` does not
already carry the target workspace grant — API-key principals, delegated tokens
aimed at another workspace, cache-miss re-checks — and from six OAuth callback
handlers whose only input is the signed `state` blob.

Two further shapes resist the predicate:

- `listWorkspacesForSubject` filters on `subject_id` alone and is inherently
  cross-account.
- The managed-access grant projection in `ensureManagedAccessForUser` also
  filters on `subject_id` alone while the account GUC is pinned to one
  organization. Today that correctly returns a multi-organization human's
  memberships everywhere. Under the predicate it would silently truncate their
  `workspaceGrants` to the pinned organization — a fail-quiet authorization
  change, which is worse than the gap it would close.

**The trap.** PostgreSQL accepts `CREATE POLICY` on a table whose RLS is disabled
and stores it inert. Three capability lanes did exactly that on
`workspace_memberships`:

| Migration | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| `0254_scoped_variable_set_authority.sql` | `variable_set_authority_capability_read` |
| `0258_three_scope_document_knowledge_authority.sql` | `personal_document_authority_capability_read` |
| `0262_scoped_connected_machines_and_rigs.sql` | `scoped_compute_capability_read` |

Each is `FOR SELECT USING (current_user = <migration owner> AND <capability>)`.
Nothing drops them. The moment anyone runs `ALTER TABLE workspace_memberships
ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, those three become the *entire* admission set, and the
runtime role is never the migration owner — so every membership read returns zero
rows and every authorization in the product fails closed. The runtime-posture
verifier inspects `relrowsecurity`, so it cannot see this. It is now pinned by
test instead.

Beyond that, every SECURITY DEFINER authorization gate that does
`PERFORM 1 FROM workspace_memberships … FOR SHARE` — the variable-set, personal-
document, scoped-compute, connection-authority, and workspace-connection-use
lanes — runs as the migration owner, which FORCE RLS does not exempt. All of them
would fail closed too.

### `auth_identities` — the premise does not hold

`auth_identities.account_id` is `text`, not a `uuid` foreign key to
`managed_accounts`. It holds Better Auth's `account.accountId`: the OAuth
provider's subject string (a Google `sub`, a GitHub numeric id, or the local user
id for password auth). `canonical-human-identities.ts` aliases it
`providerAccountId`, and the unique index is `(provider_id, account_id)`.

So `account_id = opengeni_private.current_account_id()` is a type error
(`text = uuid`) before it is a policy question. The table carries no tenant
identity in any column.

Even given a tenant column, the queries could not carry a context. Better Auth
does not use Opengeni's Drizzle handle: `apps/api/src/auth/managed-auth.ts`
constructs its own `new Pool({ connectionString })` and hands it to `betterAuth`.
Every sign-up, sign-in, OAuth link, unlink, and token refresh runs on a
connection that never executes `set_config('opengeni.*', …)` and has no code path
by which it could. The one OpenGeni-side read,
`synchronizeCanonicalHumanLoginBindings`, runs inside Better Auth's
`session.create.before` hook — strictly before any `managed_accounts` row has
been discovered for the request.

`auth_identities` is a credential store keyed by provider identity, not a tenant
resource. The right correction is to the table's description, not to its posture.

## What actually denies cross-organization access

Measured, not asserted (`packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`):
under organization B's exact request context on the runtime role, organization
A's `workspaces` row and `workspace_memberships` rows **are** readable, while
organization A's `sessions` row is **not**.

Denial for the three tables therefore rests entirely on the access layer:

- `AccessContext` is built once per request from an authenticated principal, and
  `accessGrantAuthorization` requires an exact grant for the target workspace
  before any route handler runs — 404 when the workspace does not exist, 403 when
  it exists but is not granted.
- Every workspace-scoped read then re-derives and pins `opengeni.account_id` from
  the target workspace itself, so the content tables are isolated by the account
  that owns the workspace being addressed, not by a caller-supplied claim.
- `setRlsContext` fails loud on a blank account and `assertRlsContextApplied`
  read-backs the GUC on the same backend, so a transaction-pooler backend swap
  cannot silently degrade an isolated read into a context-free one.

The residual exposure is precise: **an authenticated principal that reached the
database layer with a query it constructed itself, bypassing the access layer,
could read another organization's workspace and membership metadata — names,
ids, settings, member subject ids — but no content.** That is a defence-in-depth
gap, not an access-control hole, because no product surface issues such a query.

## Proposed amendment to the organization-tenancy acceptance criteria

Current wording (paraphrased): *cross-organization access is denied at every
surface.*

Proposed replacement:

> Cross-organization access to **workspace content** — sessions and their
> history/events/turns, documents, knowledge, connections, variable sets, rigs,
> machines, files, and every derived projection — is denied at every surface,
> and is additionally enforced by FORCE row-level security so that a query which
> bypasses the access layer still returns nothing.
>
> Cross-organization access to the **context-bootstrap tables** — `workspaces`,
> `workspace_memberships`, and the credential store `auth_identities` — is denied
> by the authentication and access layer only. These three are the tables read to
> *establish* the organization context that every RLS predicate depends on, so a
> row-level predicate over them is circular (`workspaces`,
> `workspace_memberships`) or type-incoherent (`auth_identities`, whose
> `account_id` is a provider subject string, not a tenant id). The exemption is
> recorded in
> `docs/design/organization-tenancy-non-rls-authority-tables-2026-08-18.md` and
> attested by `packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`. Adding a table
> to `NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES` is a tenancy decision and must update both.

## Related findings

### 2026-08-22 addendum: exact webhook routing keys

`automation_webhook_endpoints` is an additional deliberate non-RLS table. A
public automation request arrives with only a random endpoint UUID; that exact
key is the input used to discover the owning organization, workspace, and
FORCE-RLS `automation_sources` row. Requiring an organization GUC before this
lookup would therefore be circular in the same way as the workspace bootstrap.

The exemption is deliberately credential-free and content-free. The table
stores only the endpoint, organization, workspace, source UUIDs, and creation
time. It stores no webhook secret, provider credential, event payload, trigger
configuration, or agent input. The ingress adapter performs one equality lookup
by the unguessable primary key, establishes the returned tenant scope, loads the
source through FORCE RLS, and only then authenticates the bounded raw request
with the encrypted source secret. No public list or metadata lookup is exposed.
Source lifecycle code alone creates, rotates, or removes routing rows.

The residual database-level exposure is correspondingly narrow: code that can
issue arbitrary SQL as the runtime role could enumerate routing UUIDs and their
tenant/source attribution, but could not read the source secret or any event or
run content through this table. Moving the equality lookup behind a narrowly
granted SECURITY DEFINER function remains a possible defence-in-depth follow-up;
it is not equivalent to enabling tenant RLS, because the tenant is the result of
the lookup. Until that seam exists, the exact-global-key exemption is pinned in
`NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES` and `packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`
so it cannot widen silently.

### 2026-08-26 addendum: managed PR-review GitHub installation routes

`pr_review_managed_github_routes` is another deliberate non-RLS routing table.
The shared deployment-owned GitHub App webhook is authenticated with the
deployment webhook secret before routing, but the signed payload supplies only
the GitHub installation id and repository id needed to discover the owning
organization, workspace, registration, and repository binding. Requiring a
tenant GUC before that exact lookup would be circular.

The table contains only the globally unique installation/repository route and
its organization, workspace, registration, and binding attribution. It stores
no private key, OAuth credential, webhook secret, event payload, review prompt,
or agent output. After the deployment signature is verified, ingress performs
one equality lookup, establishes the returned tenant scope, and rechecks the
FORCE-RLS registration and binding before accepting the event through the
generic trigger system. Registration lifecycle code alone synchronizes or
removes these rows, and uniqueness prevents one signed provider event from
routing to multiple workspaces.

As with `automation_webhook_endpoints`, arbitrary runtime-role SQL could expose
route attribution but not provider credentials or review content. A narrowly
granted SECURITY DEFINER equality lookup remains a possible defence-in-depth
follow-up. Until then, this exact-global-route exemption is pinned in
`NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES` and
`packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`.

**`api_keys` hash branch.** The FORCE-RLS policy on `api_keys` is
`optional_workspace_rls_visible(account_id, workspace_id) OR key_hash =
opengeni_private.current_api_key_hash()`. The second branch carries no account,
workspace, revocation, or expiry check, and it appears in `WITH CHECK` as well as
`USING`.

It is necessary and, under the intended flow, sound: `findActiveApiKeyByHash` is
the only place that sets `opengeni.api_key_hash`, transaction-locally, from
`sha256(presented bearer)` — and presenting that bearer *is* the authentication.
Without the branch, API-key authentication would return zero rows and be dead.
Revocation and expiry are enforced in the application `WHERE`, not the policy.

The bounded residual: the branch is a plain equality on a stored, unsalted digest
rather than a proof of preimage. Anyone able to influence the GUC — SQL injection
reaching `set_config`, a future caller passing attacker-controlled data, or a leak
of the `key_hash` column — gets read *and write* access to that key's row with no
tenant fence. Blast radius is exactly one row (`key_hash` is uniquely indexed) and
the GUC is transaction-local. It was previously unexercised: the only `api_keys`
RLS test never sets the GUC, so it proves the account branch and structurally
cannot reach this one. It is now covered — the branch admits the presented key's
own row and nothing else, not even its own account's other keys.

Recommended follow-up, not taken here: fold `revoked_at IS NULL` and the expiry
check into the policy so a future query that forgets them cannot authenticate a
revoked key.

### 2026-09-02 addendum: MCP OAuth exact-key protocol state

The five `mcp_oauth_*` tables are deliberate non-RLS protocol-state tables.
Dynamic clients are deployment-global, while authorization requests, codes,
access tokens, and refresh tokens arrive at the public OAuth endpoints as only
unguessable values. Their SHA-256 hashes are the exact keys used to discover the
owning account, workspace, subject, resource, frozen permission set, and frozen
tool identities. Requiring an account or workspace GUC before that lookup would
be circular: the scoped authority is the result of the exact-key lookup.

No plaintext authorization code, access token, or refresh token is persisted.
Codes and refresh tokens are consumed or rotated atomically, every token is
expiry-bounded, redirect URI and resource bindings are checked before exchange,
and each MCP request intersects the frozen grant with live workspace authority.
The runtime role needs direct DML because these public protocol transitions run
before tenant context exists; public database access remains revoked.

The residual database-level exposure is bounded but explicit: arbitrary SQL as
the runtime role could enumerate hash-only protocol rows and their tenant,
subject, resource, and tool attribution. Moving every exact-key transition
behind narrowly granted SECURITY DEFINER routines remains a possible
defence-in-depth follow-up. Until then, the five-table exemption is pinned in
`NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES`, the runtime privilege manifest, migration tests, and
`packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts` so it cannot widen silently.

**Migration-owner naming.** The reported concern that some capability policies
hardcode `CURRENT_USER = 'postgres'` while others resolve
`pg_get_userbyid(relowner)` **does not hold in this repository.** There is not a
single occurrence of the string `'postgres'` anywhere under
`packages/db/drizzle/`, and no comparison of `current_user` to any string
literal. Every owner-gated policy uses one of two owner-agnostic idioms:
`migration_owner text := current_user` captured in a `DO` block and interpolated
with `%L` (13 sites, including `0225`, `0254`, `0258`, `0262`, `0285`), or
`current_user = pg_catalog.pg_get_userbyid(...)` resolved from the catalog (12
sites). Nothing breaks on a deployment whose owner is not named `postgres`. The
finding should be recorded as already-correct rather than as a defect.

### 2026-10-02 addendum: content-free Slack provider quotas

`slack_api_rate_limits` is a deliberate non-RLS operational table. Slack applies
its method limits across tokens sharing an app and Slack workspace, including
tokens owned by different Opengeni organizations. An organization predicate
would split the same provider quota and permit concurrent requests beyond it.

The table stores only a SHA-256 hash of the configured Slack client id, verified
Slack workspace id, and fixed API method, plus the next allowed request time. It
stores no credential, user, connection, channel, message, or tenant attribution.
Conditional UPSERT admissions serialize across replicas; provider `Retry-After`
can extend a cooldown. These rows grant no authority: exact connection and live
request authorization remain required before provider dispatch.

Arbitrary runtime-role SQL could read or alter these opaque cooldowns, affecting
availability, but cannot obtain a credential or authorize a Slack request from
this table. Migration `0597_slack_api_rate_limits.sql` revokes public access;
role provisioning grants the matching runtime role direct DML. This global
operational exemption is pinned in `NON_RLS_RUNTIME_TABLES` and
`packages/db/test/non-rls-authority-tables.test.ts`, with shared atomic admission
covered by `packages/db/test/slack-api-rate-limits.test.ts`.

## What would change the verdict

The `workspaces` and `workspace_memberships` exemptions are consequences of one
architectural fact: **the account context is derived from the workspace being
addressed, at query time, from the database.** They would become closable if the
account id were instead carried by the authenticated principal and verified
independently — for example a signed session/token claim binding
`subject → account`, checked once at the edge, so that `rlsContextForWorkspace`
becomes a *verification* (`account_id = <claimed>`) rather than a *derivation*.
That is a request-lifecycle redesign spanning Better Auth, API keys, delegated
tokens, and the OAuth callbacks, and it must be its own slice with its own
rollout. It is not a policy change.

`auth_identities` would not change even then, unless Better Auth were moved onto
Opengeni's pooled handle and the table gained a real tenant column — neither of
which is desirable for a shared credential store keyed by provider identity.
