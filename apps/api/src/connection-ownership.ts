/**
 * Who may own a *personal* Connection.
 *
 * Connection setup defaults to a workspace-owned Connection; personal ownership
 * is the explicit "Connect only for me" choice (AGENTS.md, "Connection
 * ownership and executable personal authority are separate from turn
 * initiation"). Only a managed human can own one, for two independent reasons:
 * personal authority executes only through the immutable delegation snapshot
 * frozen on a *human's* causal turn or scheduled task, and
 * `bind_connection_authority` (migration 0256) can mint the `user` authority
 * scope only for a subject holding an active organization membership. A
 * machine-owned personal row therefore lands on the `legacy_user` compatibility
 * lane and can never become a real organization-scoped authority.
 *
 * `principalKind` is the trusted, allow-listed signal: exactly `human_session`
 * passes and every other value - including absent/unknown provenance - fails
 * closed. The delegated-token contract forbids a `human_session` claim from
 * carrying `serviceInitiator` or exact agent-attempt authority, so the claim
 * cannot be combined with machine authority.
 */

/**
 * Subject namespaces Opengeni itself mints for machines. This is deliberately
 * NOT an allow-list of human subjects: `docs/embedding.md` states that
 * `subjectId` "remains opaque to Opengeni" and that the kind must not be
 * inferred from a subject-id prefix "because the host owns that namespace", so
 * a trusted embedding host legitimately signs `human_session` over an opaque
 * subject that is not `user:`-prefixed. Restricting personal ownership to
 * `user:`/`dev` would break those hosts and would itself be the prefix-based
 * kind inference the embedding contract forbids.
 *
 * The allow-list that actually decides is `principalKind === "human_session"`.
 * This list is defence-in-depth against exactly one residual threat: a holder
 * of the first-party delegation secret signing a human claim over an
 * OpenGeni-minted machine subject.
 *
 * `connection-ownership.test.ts` asserts that every machine subject named in
 * its list is rejected. Note what that does and does not buy: it catches a
 * namespace being *removed* from this constant, and it documents the known
 * machine subjects, but it is a hand-maintained list on both sides, so it
 * cannot fail when a genuinely new machine namespace is introduced elsewhere in
 * the repo. Adding one here is a manual step. That residual gap is acceptable
 * only because this check is not the deciding signal anywhere: a new machine
 * namespace still arrives with a non-`human_session` `principalKind` and is
 * refused on that basis.
 *
 * It is also no longer the sole signal on any OAuth callback: a callback that
 * persists a personal owner requires the HMAC-signed `personalOwnerVerified`
 * state claim minted by a start path that saw the live principal.
