# Session goals

Agents stop prematurely. A session goal flips the default: while a goal is
`active`, settling the last non-terminal turn arms a durable obligation to
record one typed goal-continuation internal update ("your goal is not done —
keep working, or explicitly complete/pause it"). That update joins the next
eligible internal batch and never becomes a human queue row. Finishing or
pausing the goal is an explicit act: the agent calls `opengeni__goal_complete`
with evidence or `opengeni__goal_pause` with a rationale, or a user controls
the goal directly. Workstream Pause is separate: it holds inference without
changing goal state.

Goal state is one durable Postgres row per session (`session_goals`,
RLS-isolated like every other workspace table). Its monotonic
`continuation_wake_revision` and `continuation_observed_revision` are the
authoritative obligation ledger: `wake > observed` means an evaluation still
has to be materialized. The Temporal workflow never owns that state — it reads
and mutates it only through activities. Temporal signals, workflow runs, and
workflow history are replaceable delivery nudges over Postgres truth. Goal and
workflow-wake revisions are bounded to JavaScript's maximum safe integer in
Postgres, so corruption or theoretical exhaustion fails the producing
transaction instead of rounding one producer's revision into another's.
The standing objective has a separate monotonic `objective_revision`; the
existing `version` remains the continuation/lifecycle fence. Every logical
turn freezes either the exact goal projection or an explicit no-goal projection
in `session_turns.goal_snapshot` when the turn is accepted. Ordinary turns,
goal continuations, recovery, and both compaction modes use only that snapshot,
never a later mutable goal head. The snapshot is rendered on the turn's newest
durable model-input item: a leading part of a human/API user message, or the
canonical user-role continuation message for a goal-owned turn. Other machine
updates coalesced into that turn are attached as ordinary message context. It never mutates the persistent
agent-instruction prefix or exists only in activity memory, so later requests
extend the same prompt-cache prefix and recovery replays identical authority.

## Report delivery

Agents answer in chat by default, including summaries and reports. A native
document Artifact is the deliverable when the user asks for a document or file,
or when the result is large (multi-page) or clearly meant to be kept or shared.
That can include a secondary output such as an audit produced while organizing
Knowledge. The chat reply then gives a short summary and the artifact link
rather than restating the document. Routing lives in the provider-neutral
operational instructions; the bundled `opengeni-documents` Skill owns the
authoring procedure. The artifact is the working document from the start, not a
published copy of a sandbox Markdown or DOCX report.

Report requirements are explicit, typed declarations, not a heuristic scan of
goal text, conversation content or local links. Inside a goal, declare them
before authoring: initial reports belong in `goal_set` /
`GoalSpec.reportRequirements`; reports discovered during an active goal are
appended through `goal_progress` without replacing the objective. Each
requirement has a stable `id` and `title`. A session without a goal does not
create one only to declare a document.

Completion must match every persisted requirement to a native document and a
server-authored inspection receipt. The receipt identifies the exact inspected
head; a caller-supplied head hash or `inspected: true` alone is not proof. Inspect
the relevant final body content after the last edit; a summary query alone does
not qualify. Missing delivery, a wrong
artifact, stale inspection, or denied access leaves the goal incomplete. Supply
the returned artifact reference in the user handoff so the user can continue
from the same document in Artifacts.

When artifact tooling is unavailable, do not invent a receipt or silently
substitute a sandbox link. Explain the concrete blocker and retain the unfinished
deliverable. Ordinary in-chat answers, brief status updates, internal worker
findings, source-code navigation, and explicitly requested local-file workflows
are outside this report contract. Without a goal, the artifact-first authoring
and handoff procedure still applies to a document deliverable, but nothing is
declared and no goal-completion guard runs.

The guard proves delivery of **declared** reports, not the semantic quality or
completeness of arbitrary prose. Routing instructions make declaration part of
report authoring; the server does not infer undeclared reports from text. Current
inspection proof establishes the document head at completion, not permanent
immutability of the editable document afterward.

The trusted application records inspection receipts only after a successful
native query and current-head recheck; agent-facing APIs accept receipt identity,
not caller-authored receipt contents. This is a server-verification boundary,
not cryptographic attestation against a compromised application or arbitrary
runtime-role SQL writer. Those actors already hold database-write authority and
can manufacture inspection-shaped records; do not describe these receipts as
unforgeable database proof. Storage fences prevent supported writers from
silently dropping declared requirements, but do not replace application trust.
Receipt updates and direct deletion are rejected while the owning session
exists; normal session-retention cascades still remove its receipts. Database
administrators and arbitrary application-role SQL remain trusted.

Proof certifies a successful bounded native `body` query, not exhaustive
inspection of every page or annotation. Receiving-human access is independently
verified from the turn's frozen initiating-human identity. Existing Personal
workspace artifact-authorization gaps and service-only turns without that human
fail closed; the report guard does not widen artifact permissions.

Migration `0474_goal_report_requirements.sql` adds rolling-compatible requirement,
completion, inspection-receipt and cancellation fences without a new table.
Pending requirements are append-only through semantic rewrites. Explicit
human/API cancellation remains supported; agents cannot clear them to bypass
delivery. An older application cannot complete a report-bearing goal without
stored proof. Artifact contention aborts the transaction through `NOWAIT`;
retry only after rollback, never with an unlocked validation fallback.

## Migration 0257 deployment boundary

Migration `0257_goal_revision_decisions_and_root_constraints.sql` is a one-way
maintenance cutover, not a rolling application change. Stop every API,
control-worker, and turn-worker process before applying it. Set
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` to the comma-separated exact
database logins used by every old and new API/worker identity, then run the
migration. The programmatic equivalent is
`runMigrations(adminUrl, schema, { applicationDatabaseRoles: [...] })`;
dedicated-schema/scoped deployments must use that explicit option. Only the
canonical standalone `opengeni_app` topology has a default. Migration 0257
checks the supplied roles both before and after taking exclusive locks and
aborts with SQLSTATE `55000` when any listed identity remains connected. Do not
derive the list from the migration-owner URL or omit a retired identity during
a role rotation.
After commit, never restart a pre-0257 image: an old worker does not understand
the accepted-turn `rootConstraints` snapshot and would execute without that
frozen authority. Application rollback is valid only before migration
activation; afterward, recovery is forward-only with a 0257-compatible image.

## Lifecycle

A goal is `active`, `paused`, or `completed`.

- `goal_set` (agent tool), `CreateSessionRequest.goal`, or
  `ScheduledTaskAgentConfig.goal` create it. Setting a goal on a session that
  already has one remains a supported low-level/API/scheduler redirect: it
  re-activates the goal, resets continuation counters, and arms a wake. The
  agent-facing `goal_set` creates when no goal exists or replaces a completed
  goal, and accepts only `text` and `successCriteria`: `maxAutoContinuations`
  is API/scheduled-task configuration (an agent that capped its own goal used
  to silence its orchestration for hours). Active and paused goals are changed
  through the policy-fenced `goal_update`, so an incidental set cannot silently
  redirect live intent.
- `goal_update` declares `refinement`, `adaptation`, or `replacement`, a
  rationale, and the expected objective revision. `review_changes` always
  records an immutable proposal when deliberately configured by the user/API;
  the default `preserve_intent` and `autonomous_adaptation` directly apply every
  declared kind. These classifications describe the audit history, not separate
  approval gates. The agent maintains its operational goal in response to human
  direction and relevant evidence, without requiring the human to approve the
  same direction again through a second UI/API action. API/user
  redirects apply directly. An applied semantic change advances both objective
  and lifecycle revisions but is not execution progress. Proposed content is
  not composed into model instructions until a user applies it.
- Goal edits do not grant permissions, change root constraints, or authorize
  work beyond the human's actual request. Preserve the intended outcome rather
  than shrinking it to fit completed work. Internal revision numbers remain
  optimistic-concurrency fences and immutable audit history, not user rituals.
  Existing default-policy goals receive this behavior when the new API and
  worker code is deployed; no database rewrite or automatic replay of pending
  proposals occurs. A previously proposed change must be reconciled against
  the current goal and submitted as a fresh update if it is still warranted.
  Explicit `review_changes` goals retain their configured review requirement.
- Root constraints are bounded, normalized standing constraints that may be
  changed only through the direct human/API path. Every accepted turn freezes
  them with its goal snapshot. A goal-bearing child inherits the calling
  turn's exact frozen set when the field is omitted, while an explicit array
  may only narrow that set. Explicit `[]` delegates no root constraints.
- `goal_progress` optionally records a concrete, attempt-fenced audit fact without
  changing text, criteria, policy, objective revision, or lifecycle version.
  Legacy `goal_update.progressNote` calls route through this separate operation.
  Agent calls require a stable UUID `idempotencyKey`. That operation identity
  belongs to the target session across replacement attempts, while its durable
  receipt retains the attempt that first applied it for audit. The receipt,
  exact result snapshot, goal revision, session-sequenced `goal.updated` event,
  and mutation commit atomically. A recovered attempt can therefore reconcile
  a lost response without applying the update twice; replaying an older key
  returns its stored result and never overwrites a newer goal revision.
- `goal_complete { evidence }` is terminal. Only a new `goal_set` can replace a
  completed goal.
- `goal_pause { rationale }` stops the loop until the goal is resumed or
  replaced.
- `goal_resume {}` reactivates any paused goal regardless of pause actor or
  reason, preserves its objective, resets continuation counters, and arms its
  durable wake. Already-active calls succeed unchanged. Existing sessions with
  `goal_pause` also receive `goal_resume` within the deployment tool ceiling.
  The agent is told to resume only when the user asks it to continue or the
  blocker it paused for has cleared. A user's question alone is not a reason:
  the agent answers it and leaves the goal paused. An active goal still
  continues through its ordinary continuation after that answer. When work the
  agent started is still in flight (a child, a command, or a timed recheck), it
  answers and registers `wait_for_input` again instead, even with an active
  goal, so no continuation spends a turn rediscovering that wait. Each turn's
  wait sets a fresh deadline, so a re-wait reuses the earlier reason and passes
  only the time left before the earlier deadline.

Long waits are session-level rather than goal mutations. `wait_for_input {
reason, timeoutSeconds, idempotencyKey? }` is self-only, requires no goal, and
stores the declaring turn plus a 30-second-to-7-day relative safety deadline on
the session. An active goal remains active while the session waits; use
`goal_pause` instead when the goal itself must stop for a human decision. See
[`mcp-surfaces.md`](mcp-surfaces.md) and
[`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md).

New goal text and success criteria are each limited to 8 KiB of UTF-8, rewrite
and pause rationales to 2 KiB, and progress notes to 4 KiB. Root constraints
are limited to 16 items, 512 UTF-8 bytes per item, and 4 KiB in aggregate.
Pre-0257 goals remain exact and lifecycle-mutable even when larger. Their immutable
accepted-turn prompt snapshot uses a deterministic UTF-8 prefix with an
explicit original-byte truncation fact, so ordinary turns, recovery, and
compaction stay bounded without rewriting canonical history.

Every current goal transition lands on the session timeline as `goal.set`,
`goal.updated`, `goal.progress`, `goal.rewrite.proposed`, `goal.completed`,
`goal.paused`, `goal.resumed`, `goal.cleared`, or `goal.continuation`. Historical
`goal.held` rows remain readable for pre-0402 audit compatibility; new
session-level waits use `session.wait.started` and `session.wait.finished`.

## The continuation loop

The continuation is a revisioned obligation, not a workflow polling loop:

1. Terminal settlement of the last active turn atomically advances the active
   goal's wake revision and the session workflow-wake outbox. A worker death or
   lost activity response after that commit cannot leave an admitted idle goal
   with no wake.
2. Direct delivery uses `signalWithStart`; the workflow-wake dispatcher retries
   an undelivered revision with bounded backoff. A completed workflow, worker
   restart, or `continueAsNew` therefore does not own or erase the obligation.
3. At an idle boundary `maybeContinueGoal` materializes the revision in one
   Postgres transaction. It locks and re-checks admission, session, goal,
   non-terminal turns, authoritative Steer work, existing continuation updates,
   and provider-capacity waiters before evaluating limits.
4. A successful decision atomically commits the continuation counter, one
   `goal_continuation` system update, `system.update.pending` and
   `goal.continuation` events, one `agent_run.created` usage fact, the observed
   revision, session state/sequence, and another workflow-wake outbox revision.
   If any write fails, all of them roll back. The stable dedupe key is
   `goal-continuation:<goalId>:wake:<wakeRevision>`, so a retry after a lost
   commit response cannot spend the continuation count or create a second
   update, usage fact, event pair, or logical goal turn.

The locked decision applies these rules:

1. No goal, or goal not `active` → idle shutdown, exactly as before.
2. Any non-terminal turn exists (`queued`, `running`, `requires_action`,
   `recovering`, or `waiting_capacity`) →
   the queue wins. A pending human approval is never bypassed by a
   continuation.
   A pending human/API prompt and an authoritative Steer instruction also win
   even if they race materialization. Any other pending machine input
   (`session_system_updates` row such as a child result, agent message, or
   schedule) also wins with `queue`: it is delivered by the next claim rather
   than shadowed by a synthesized continuation, and because peek and
   materialization serialize on the session lock, input that lands between
   them cannot be missed. See [`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md)
   for the wake classes.
3. Before the goal materializer runs, `peekSessionWork` evaluates a current
   session-level `wait_for_input`. It is current only while no newer finished
   turn has retired it (a turn a person did not start, or a person's turn that
   consumed immediate machine input) and the database deadline is ahead. While
   held, the workflow re-arms `session_input_wait_deadline` in the durable wake
   outbox and closes without consuming a goal revision. Immediate machine input
   or a queued human/API turn wins and runs normally; deferred child notices
   remain parked. A human or API turn that neither waits again nor consumes
   immediate machine input leaves the wait held, so it neither triggers a
   continuation that only rediscovers the wait nor strands a later child
   result. A newer finished goal, system, or other machine-input turn, or a
   person's turn that consumed the awaited input, clears the wait with
   `session.wait.finished{outcome:"input"}`. An unchanged expired deadline
   atomically clears it and queues `session_wait_timeout` input. The active-goal
   projection may report this independent session wait as `blocked` /
   `held_for_input`, with `nextAttemptAt` and `holdReason`, but goal mutations
   do not own or clear it.
4. Consecutive no-input continuations are paced, not capped. `auto_continuations`
   counts only consecutive synthesized continuations whose claimed batch
   contained no other machine input and that no human/API/Steer turn
   interrupted: the claim transaction that binds a goal turn to its exact batch
   resets the streak when any other member (child result, agent message,
   schedule) rides along, a human/API/scheduled turn finishing after the last
   continuation resets it, and a Steer supersession resets it. When the
   streak is `n >= 1` and the last continuation turn is still the newest
   finished turn, the materializer defers the next continuation until
   `finished_at + schedule[min(n - 1, last)]` (`OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MS`,
   default `3000,30000,120000,300000`, every delay bounded by
   `OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MAX_MS`, default 600000). It returns
   `deferred` without touching the wake/observed ledger, counters, updates, or
   usage, and re-arms a delayed workflow wake (`goal_idle_backoff`,
   `notBefore` at the deadline) through the session workflow-wake outbox on
   every idle evaluation; the deadline lives only in
   `session_workflow_wake_outbox.next_attempt_at`, never in a Temporal timer or
   a new column. Any new input (pending machine input, a human prompt, Steer)
   commits its own immediate wake, which pulls that row to now, and wins the
   next evaluation as ordinary input. The API projects the pacing delay as
   `scheduled` / `backoff_pending` with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline.
5. Budget/admission policy can pause the goal visibly with reason `limits`.
   OpenGeni does not infer progress or blockage from tool/event shape; the
   model explicitly completes or pauses the goal under the continuation
   instructions, and a user can control it directly.
6. Goals are NOT capped by continuation count by default - runs legitimately
   span days. If a deployment sets
   `OPENGENI_GOAL_MAX_AUTO_CONTINUATIONS` it becomes a hard ceiling
   (`min(goal.maxAutoContinuations, setting)`, pause reason
   `"max_auto_continuations"`); a per-goal `maxAutoContinuations` (API or
   scheduled-task configuration only) applies on its own even without the
   deployment setting. The ceiling bounds the same consecutive no-input streak
   as the backoff, so any consumed external input resets it. Reaching it is
   pacing, not user intent: every external input producer resumes the goal
   automatically in the same commit as that input: child results
   (`child_terminal_result`), scheduled occurrences (`scheduled_occurrence`),
   media results (`media_generation_result`), Agent messages
   (`agent_message`), Agent Steer (`agent_steer_instruction`), and human/API
   Send/Steer. Each emits `goal.resumed` (`actor: "system"`,
   `reason: "external_input"`, and the causing update or turn) at its next
   session sequence, starts a fresh continuation epoch, and arms the wake. A
   `user_pause`, `api`, `agent`, or `limits` pause is never auto-resumed.
7. Otherwise one deterministic goal-continuation internal update is recorded.
   At claim, its exact prompt becomes one canonical user-role model-memory item
   with the frozen goal snapshot; it is not duplicated into the generic
   internal-update envelope. Any unrelated machine updates coalesced with it
   are attached as ordinary message context. The turn uses the session's tool surface
   plus the first-party `opengeni` MCP server (so the goal tools are always
   reachable), and the session's stored conversation — the agent keeps its full
   context. It may start one internal-update inference only after queued human
   prompts and approvals, and only while the effective workstream gate is active.
   Its model and reasoning effort come from the newest turn that durably emitted
   `turn.started`, falling back to the session default only when no turn has
   actually run. This preserves an explicit per-turn provider/billing selection;
   a newer turn rejected during admission cannot poison the continuation policy.
   That conversation comes from `session_history_items`, the one SDK-native
   model-memory store (see `docs/run-lifecycle.md`).

The canonical continuation prompt identifies itself as generated input, not a
new user request or grant of authority. The current applied goal frozen for the
turn, its criteria, root constraints, and report requirements remain the
objective; no revision summary, synthesized progress, or evidence-validity
claim is injected. Pending proposals and historical objectives do not replace
that objective.

Ordinary continuation resumes established work rather than restarting discovery
or full reconciliation on every turn. Reuse authoritative evidence only for the
requirement, scope, version, and state it establishes; recheck changed, stale,
uncertain, or insufficient evidence. Assistant claims and summaries locate
evidence, not prove it. Full reconciliation or a comprehensive audit remains
substantive work when the goal, user, or applicable Skill requests it, when
uncertainty or recovery warrants it, or when risk or gates require it. Before
`goal_complete`, the full completion audit still covers every requirement and
deliverable with authoritative evidence, including fresh checks wherever
required. Evidence reuse does not weaken report-delivery or other gates.

Persistence is evidence-based, not a minimum number of blocked turns. Try
plausible safe authorized alternatives for recoverable failures; neither
unbounded exhaustion nor repeated unchanged failure is required. A definitive
missing permission, human decision, or external prerequisite with no actionable
authorized path can justify an immediate pause, with the blocker, evidence or
attempted alternatives, and the change needed to resume. Tool approvals remain
human-only. Work in flight or a meaningful timed recheck uses the available
waiting mechanism instead; continue independent authorized work first.

There is no required preliminary short wait or status recheck before
`wait_for_input`. Its safety deadline follows the dependency or a meaningful
monitoring cadence, potentially hours or days within the tool's limits, not the
execution-wait limits of `session_wait` or `command_wait`. Monitoring and user
notification cadences are separate. Active work gets useful milestone/context
updates; suspended work does not wake just to reassure, unless an explicit
user/task/Skill update cadence calls for it. Existing live-attempt limitations
(including pending Codemode calls), event cursors, wake registration, and
question-turn deadline preservation still apply.

### Guidance validation scenarios

These are review cases for the instruction contract, not claims of measured
model behavior. Source tests pin the emitted guidance and retained safeguards;
they do not establish that a model follows them in live execution.

| Scenario | Expected instruction-level decision |
| --- | --- |
| Goal explicitly requires a comprehensive audit | Audit/reconcile the whole requested scope; proportionality must not shrink it. |
| Ordinary continuation with valid exact-scope evidence | Resume established work and reuse that evidence; still audit all requirements before completion. |
| Evidence is stale, changed, uncertain, or insufficient | Recheck the affected state; broaden reconciliation when the uncertainty or required gate warrants it. |
| Child will run overnight | With no other work, register an out-of-turn wait and an appropriate safety deadline; no preliminary poll or short wait. Consume the terminal result before dependent completion. |
| External deployment needs checks at a meaningful interval | Use the available monitoring/wait mechanism at that cadence; notify on useful changes rather than at every check by default. |
| User requests frequent updates even while waiting | Honor the explicit cadence within authority and tool limits; this is an exception to the no-reassurance-wake default. |
| User asks a question during an existing wait | Answer only the question and preserve the original deadline using the time remaining. Below the tool minimum or after expiry, a question-only human/API turn consuming no immediate machine input can finish without replacing the retained wait. Never send an invalid timeout or silently extend the deadline; outside that retained-wait case, register a valid wait if needed and disclose any unavoidable adjustment. |
| Definitive missing permission or required human choice | Pause immediately if no meaningful authorized work remains; identify what must change. Never approve a tool for a human. |
| Recoverable transient failure | Investigate and try plausible authorized alternatives; retry only with reason to expect progress, not a fixed quota or unlimited search. |
| Short task explicitly requires a fresh independent worker | Honor the request despite the direct-handling/reuse default; keep the independent deliverable distinct and join its result. |

The resulting internal-update inference is an ordinary billed run: it meters
`agent_run.created` with source `session_system_update` and streams like a
user-triggered inference without appearing in the prompt queue. If billing or
usage limits would block another run, the goal pauses visibly
(`goal.paused`, `reason: "limits"`) instead of failing the session; the limits
gate is applied inside the same locked decision, before the counter bump, so a
budget pause never consumes continuation budget. Re-arming a goal (resume or
replace) starts a fresh continuation epoch: counters and the
previous-continuation pointers are cleared together. A worker can re-dispatch a
recovering logical goal turn under a new fenced attempt after death; that is
recovery of the same turn, not creation or charging of another continuation.

## Pauses and failures

- Workstream Pause preserves an active goal. Its recursive admission gate keeps
  the goal's internal continuation inert; Resume admits it again without
  inventing a prompt or silently changing goal status. Resume advances a
  revision and commits a repairable workflow wake, so it also works after the
  previous workflow run closed.
- If a turn fails and the session is marked `failed`, the goal row is left
  as-is. A new human prompt can revive the session; it does not silently resume
  a goal that the user paused. Only a goal paused by the continuation ceiling
  (`max_auto_continuations`) is resumed by new input, because that pause is
  pacing rather than intent.
- Provider backpressure persists a capacity waiter. It blocks goal
  materialization until authoritative allocator re-evaluation records recovery;
  no model polling or synthetic human message is used.
- If the `maybeContinueGoal` activity exhausts its short Temporal retry window,
  the workflow records a delayed durable retry wake and closes rather than
  failing the session or spinning. The outbox restarts the workflow with
  `signalWithStart` after the backoff. The same rule covers a lost workflow
  signal/start and survives `continueAsNew`.
- The materializer has one explicit invariant-repair path for an admitted idle
  active goal reached without a wake revision: it first persists a new
  monotonic obligation and then evaluates it. This is crash repair, not a scan
  or polling path. The API exposes the unarmed state as broken until repair
  commits.

## API

- `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions` accepts `goal: { text, successCriteria?,
  rootConstraints?, maxAutoContinuations?, mutationPolicy? }`. A `goal.set`
  event is appended right after
  `session.created`.
- `GET /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions/:sessionId/goal` returns the goal plus a
  `continuation` projection from one repeatable-read Postgres snapshot
  (`sessions:read`; 404 when the session has no goal). The projection reports
  `inactive`, `scheduled`, `running`, `blocked`, or `invariant_broken`, with a
  typed reason, wake/observed revisions, optional next-attempt time, the
  latest workflow-wake error, and (for `held_for_input`) the agent's stated
  `holdReason` so a human sees why the goal is waiting and until when. Clients must not infer autonomy from goal/session
  status alone: `running` is reserved for a live goal-owned turn and alone
  means "Pursuing". A live human/API or system turn blocks autonomous
  continuation; recovering or queued work is scheduled. Pause, approval,
  provider backpressure, cancellation, pending wake/update, a session-level
  `wait_for_input` declaration (`blocked` / `held_for_input`, `nextAttemptAt` at the
  deadline), idle backoff between consecutive no-input continuations
  (`scheduled` / `backoff_pending`, `nextAttemptAt` at the pacing deadline),
  and a missing obligation are distinct truthful states.
- `PATCH /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions/:sessionId/goal` with
  `{ status: "paused" | "active", rationale? }` is the operator override
  (`sessions:control`). Pausing emits `goal.paused` (`actor: "api"`). Resuming
  is only valid from `paused`: it resets the counters, emits `goal.resumed`
  (`actor: "api"`, `reason: "api"`), and wakes the session workflow - resume
  works even on a fully idle session because `signalWithStart` restarts a
  completed workflow. Invalid transitions (e.g. resuming a completed goal)
  return 409. A `max_auto_continuations` pause additionally resumes itself on
  new external input (`goal.resumed`, `actor: "system"`,
  `reason: "external_input"`); no other pause reason does.
- The same `PATCH` accepts a direct semantic redirect with `{ text,
  successCriteria?, rootConstraints?, mutationPolicy?, rationale,
  expectedObjectiveRevision }`.
  This user-authoritative path may replace/re-activate a completed goal and
  wakes an otherwise idle session.
- `GET .../goal/revisions` preserves the original unbounded raw-array contract
  for existing clients. `GET .../goal/revisions/page?limit=...&before=...`
  exposes a separately named bounded keyset page of immutable applied,
  proposed, and rejected history.
  `POST .../goal/revisions/:revisionId/apply` applies a proposal under an exact
  objective-revision fence; the proposal row remains immutable and the new
  applied revision links it by `proposalId`. `POST .../reject` records an
  immutable rejection decision and supports safe replay. `POST .../rollback`
  restores an applied revision as a new applied revision under the same exact
  comparison-and-swap fence; history is never rewritten.
- `DELETE /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions/:sessionId/goal` clears the session's
  active goal (`sessions:control`). It deletes the goal row, emits
  `goal.cleared` when a goal existed, and is idempotent when no goal exists.

## Scheduled tasks

`agentConfig.goal` arms a goal on dispatched sessions. New-session runs create
the goal with the session; reusable-session runs re-arm it on every fire
(replace text, reactivate, reset counters) — a recurring "maintain X" task
re-establishes its objective each time.

## Agent tool access

The goal tools are session-scoped first-party MCP tools. Agent `goal_update`
requires an explicit `changeKind`, non-empty `rationale`, and
`expectedObjectiveRevision`; optional execution-progress audit facts use the
separate `goal_progress` tool but do not gate continuation. The worker signs the
session id into the delegated access token it uses for first-party MCP calls
(HMAC, worker-asserted — not agent-controlled), and the API registers
`goal_set`/`goal_update`/`goal_progress`/`goal_complete`/`goal_pause` only for grants carrying
that claim plus the `goals:manage` permission. `wait_for_input` is a separate
self-only session-control tool (`sessions:control`) and is in the default
first-party selection, but it is not required merely because a session has a
goal. A top-level session with no
first-party permission override uses the worker default. A child inherits its
creator's exact effective permissions, and an explicit set may only narrow
them; goal-bearing creation is rejected when that resulting set omits
`goals:manage` rather than silently broadening the child. Goal-bearing sessions
also require the goal lifecycle names in the separate effective
`firstPartyMcpTools` selection. The minimal default includes them; an explicit
or inherited selection that omits them is rejected rather than widened.
Goal-bearing sessions, turns, and scheduled dispatches force-merge the
`opengeni` tool ref so these
reachable even when the session was created with an empty tool list. The
worker also signs the exact turn, attempt, and execution generation used to
authorize a first application of `goal_update`; a replacement attempt may
reconcile the same target-scoped operation key, but a key reused with different

| `OPENGENI_GOAL_MAX_AUTO_CONTINUATIONS` | _(unset - no cap)_ | Optional hard ceiling on consecutive no-input continuation turns per goal arming. Unset by default, so a run can legitimately span days. When set, it is a ceiling that a per-goal `maxAutoContinuations` can only lower; reaching it pauses the goal until new external input resumes it. |
| `OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MS` | `3000,30000,120000,300000` | Comma-separated pacing delays (ms) before the n-th consecutive no-input continuation, measured from when the previous continuation turn finished; the last entry repeats. Not a cap: any new input wakes the session immediately. |
| `OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | `600000` | Upper bound on every idle-backoff delay; schedule entries above it are rejected at boot. |
| `OPENGENI_CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_ENABLED` | `false` | Produce the child lifecycle notices (`child_requires_action`, its resolution, `child_paused`, `child_waiting_capacity`, `child_progress`) for parent sessions. Enable only after the whole fleet runs an image that understands the new kinds. The goal-continuation prompt teaches the orchestrator what each notice means and, when `session_human_input_respond` is in its effective first-party selection, that it may answer a worker's blocking question itself. |


### Interpreting wake delivery

A successful Temporal signal only confirms transport acceptance. The durable
wake acknowledgment guard may still return `pending_admission` with a queued
prompt, machine input, input wait, Agent Steer, or quiescence blocker. The wake
dispatcher's result and structured reconciliation log separate `signaled`,
`delivered` (acknowledged revisions), `pendingAdmission` by blocker, and
`unconfirmed` legacy signal-only responses. None is proof of a model turn:
verify the durable attempt claim and `turn.started` before reporting execution.
Pending revisions keep the existing outbox backoff and admission rules; these
counters neither resume paused work nor authorize a new attempt. Logs emit each
blocker count as a numeric `pendingAdmissionBlockers.<blocker>` attribute; the
activity result retains the blocker object.

Transport acceptance is reported before attempting the database acknowledgment.
If that acknowledgment fails, a batch can report both `signaled` and `failed`
for the same revision; `delivered` remains zero and the original error propagates
to immediate callers. Older embedding clients may omit the optional transport
observer; successful void responses remain `unconfirmed`, not acknowledged.
