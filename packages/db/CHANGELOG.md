## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- aad6598: Claude subscription setup and replacement require only the setup token. Observe
  provider usage and reset windows from ordinary model responses, including quota
  errors, and expose scoped cached reads and authorized refreshes. Preserve the last
  reading when inference-only tokens cannot use the separate usage endpoint; fence
  cached readings against credential replacement and revocation.
- 3f9c757: An organization service key can change an existing external member's
  permissions in one shared workspace without removing and re-adding them:
  `PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/workspaces/:workspaceId/external-members/:membershipId`
  (`updateExternalWorkspaceMember` in the SDK) with `{ operationId, permissions }`.
  It is keyed and idempotent like a grant, capped by the key's permissions, and
  never cancels or tears down work. Narrowing also advances the member's
  organization authorization revision so frozen authority re-checks on next use.
  Rolling migration 0540 adds the `update` action to the external membership
  operation ledger.
- cabfc5e: Organization usage summaries now list each member's Personal workspace as a
  usage-only row (`personalWorkspaces`, keyed by the owner's organization
  membership, plus `personalWorkspaceCount`). Rows carry amounts only - never the
  Personal workspace id, name, sessions or content - and follow the same
  actor-visible session rule as the period totals, which already counted this
  usage. Rolling migration 0543 replaces the aggregate with the same signature and
  ACL, so older API processes keep working and ignore the new fields, which
  default to empty.
- 8669490: Add per-person product lifecycle facts to the durable host export as a third kind, `lifecycle_fact`. Migration `0532_product_lifecycle_fact_export.sql` (rolling) captures one content-free fact per sign-up, email verification, sign-in, organization setup, model connection, credit top-up, connection, scheduled task, installed catalog Skill, Slack user link, enrolled machine and organization join, in the same transaction as the product change. Nothing is captured until a host registers a `lifecycle_fact` consumer, and a capture failure never fails the product change.

  Every fact is a fixed type with an optional value from a fixed per-type list (`PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE_FACT_ATTRIBUTES`), a subject kind, the opaque `user:`/`api_key:` subject id when there is one, and the organization and workspace UUIDs when the product change has them. Sign-up, verification and sign-in facts carry no organization. `claimHostExportBatch` accepts `kind: "lifecycle_fact"` and returns a `HostLifecycleFactExportBatch`; `createHostExportPump` accepts an optional `lifecycleSink`.

- f986809: Scheduled tasks can post to one Slack channel as the OpenGeni workspace bot. A person chooses the channel in the schedule editor ("Post to Slack" under Advanced), stored as `agentConfig.slackBotChannelId` next to `slackBotConnectionId`. Choosing or changing it needs a signed-in person with `connections:write`, and the bot must be a member of an active channel that is not shared with another organization. Agents, services and API keys cannot set or change it. `listScheduledTaskSlackChannels` in the SDK lists the eligible channels.

  Runs of such a task get two tools, `slack_bot_prepare_message` and `slack_bot_send_prepared_message`, which take no channel. Prepare saves the exact text; send posts it to the task's channel with the saved server-owned id as the Slack post operation id, so a retried send never posts twice. Both re-read the task at every call, so clearing or changing the channel takes effect immediately and never redirects an already prepared message. Rolling migration 0530 adds the private prepared-message table and its two capabilities.

- 1ea4c69: Show when a scheduled task's frozen access is out of date, let its owner refresh it, and tell the owner when a run could not use a connector.

  For the task owner (or, for a task without an owner, people who manage schedules), scheduled task reads include a read-only `policyDrift`: workspace default connectors the task lacks, connectors the workspace no longer sets up, default OpenGeni tools missing from an agent-created task's frozen creator policy, connectors whose chosen account can no longer be used, and connectors with no account although one is now available. `POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/scheduled-tasks/:taskId/refresh-access` (SDK `refreshScheduledTaskAccess`) re-freezes exactly that with the calling person's current authority through the ordinary owner update path. Only a signed-in person may call it; API keys, services, delegated bearers and agents cannot, a changed task returns 409, and a refreshed creator policy keeps a frozen permission only while that person holds it, adds only the permissions its newly added tools need (within the default worker set and that person's grant), and never changes the creator session policy.

  Scheduled runs whose own turn recorded `tool.auth_needed` carry `accessFailures`, and `GET .../scheduled-tasks/attention` (SDK `listScheduledTaskAccessAttention`) lists schedules whose latest run failed that way until a later run succeeds. It also lists schedules the scheduler refuses before creating a run because a chosen connector account can no longer be used (`unavailableAccounts`, with a null `runId` and `firedAt`), checked at read time with the same account plan as the drift; each item carries the task's `executionDigest`. The web console shows a dot on the Schedules navigation item, a badge on the schedule's row, a notice on the schedule's page with a one-click refresh, and the failure on each run row.

  The refresh accepts an optional `leaveOut` naming default connectors and OpenGeni tools to keep off the schedule; it only narrows what the refresh adds. The schedule page's "Keep without these" hides those defaults in that browser for the reviewed task head and passes them as `leaveOut` when the owner refreshes.

  `@opengeni/contracts` exports `ScheduledTaskPolicyDrift`, `ScheduledTaskAccessConnector`, `ScheduledTaskRunAccessFailure`, `ScheduledTaskAccessAttention`, `ListScheduledTaskAccessAttentionResponse`, and `RefreshScheduledTaskAccessRequest`; `ToolAuthNeededReason` is unchanged but now declared earlier in the module. `@opengeni/db` adds `listScheduledTaskCreatorPolicies`, `listScheduledTaskRunAuthNeededEvents`, `listScheduledTaskAccessAttentionEvents`, `listActiveScheduledTasksWithConnectionAccounts`, and `ScheduledTaskHeadChangedError`, and `updateScheduledTask` accepts `expectedExecutionDigest` and `creatorFirstPartyPolicy`.

- 30414a0: Add the first-party `session_set_model` MCP tool for changing an existing session's future model and reasoning defaults without waking it or rewriting accepted work. Preserve ordinary target authorization and exact-attempt fencing, provide stable idempotent receipts across reconnects, and report canonical model, reasoning and latency settings in full session readback. Share effective defaults across prompt admission, goal continuation, compaction and scheduled snapshots so older queued or resumed turns cannot undo an explicit choice. Deploy API and workers from a matched source cohort before using the new operation.
- b37af05: New Slack tasks post a shorter first message. It is one sentence that links to the session ("OpenGeni started this task", with the routed workspace named inline when routing made a choice) and carries a single Stop button while the task runs. It no longer lists the connectors, repositories and Sandbox Environment the task started with. Stop (or replying `stop`) now swaps the button to Resume on the same message instead of posting a task controls card, and the button leaves the message when the task settles. New tasks have no Status button, no task controls card and no Make recurring link, and later messages in the thread no longer repeat the workspace. The one-time first-task hint is shorter, and `<command> info` suggests asking OpenGeni in the thread to repeat a task on a schedule when the person may and the Slack task tools include scheduling.

  The opening sentence is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0537 adds `slack_interactions.start_message_line`), so repairs and button updates re-render identical bytes for the digest-bound post and update ledgers. Interactions bound before this change keep their previous messages byte for byte, including their Status, Stop and Resume buttons and task controls cards; their control buttons now render from their reserved handles whatever the handles' status, so an acknowledgement repair after a press no longer conflicts. `@opengeni/db` adds `listPendingSlackInteractionMessageActionHandles`, a `supersedeSiblings` option on `settleSlackInteractionActionHandles`, and `startMessageLine` on `SlackInteraction` and `bindSlackInteractionSession`.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/db` `bindSlackInteractionSession` no longer accepts `sessionDefaultsLine` (nothing writes that column any more; existing values are still read), and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`, which only rendered that line, is removed.

- 14990d0: A task started from Slack now starts from what the workspace offers every new session instead of the person's last website composer selection. Connectors follow the workspace default connector policy (including the person's own personal connections when that policy includes connected servers, still executable only through the frozen delegation snapshot), OpenGeni tools follow the workspace default selection, and the Sandbox Environment and its Variable Sets follow the workspace default. Only an explicitly chosen model carries over. Mentions, commands, DMs and shortcuts now always add the read-only Slack context tools, including when the workspace has its own default OpenGeni tool selection; reactions still do not.

  Repositories are the person's own recently used repositories in that workspace: those on the top-level sessions they started there in the last 30 days, most recent first, at most five, and only through their current entry in the workspace GitHub App catalog (same catalog and `github:use` permission as the website picker), on the default branch. Archived and empty repositories are skipped. A person with no recent repositories gets none; GitHub is asked only when there is something to look up, and an outage starts the task without repositories. These repositories are attached best effort.

  Repository resources gain an optional `optional: true` flag (contracts and SDK). A failed clone of such a repository logs a warning, is reported as `skippedOptionalRepositories` on the `repository-clone` operation event, and no longer fails sandbox setup; a repository without the flag keeps the strict behavior. `GitHubRepository` gains optional `archived` and `sizeKb`, filled from GitHub when reported.

  The Slack acknowledgement adds one line naming what the task started with, for example `Using connectors: Gmail, Linear; repos: opengeni.` It names only connectors the first accepted turn can reach, so a personal-only connector the person never connected is not claimed. The line is frozen on the interaction when its session binds (rolling migration 0529 adds the nullable `slack_interactions.session_defaults_line`), so a repaired acknowledgement re-renders identical bytes. A Slack message or a reacted-to message that links a workspace or session on a different deployment under the same parent domain (for example staging versus production) now carries a model-context note, so the agent says the link is for the other deployment instead of reporting the session as not found.

  Breaking: `@opengeni/core` removes `getActorNewSessionDefaults`. Use `getActorNewSessionModelChoice`, which returns only an explicitly chosen model policy. `@opengeni/db` adds `SlackInteraction.sessionDefaultsLine`, an optional `sessionDefaultsLine` input to `bindSlackInteractionSession` (written only by the bind that wins), `listRecentSessionRepositoryResources`, and `getSessionFirstTurnConnectionAuthority`.

- d1f4724: Every accepted turn now records the product surface its request entered through: `web`, `slack`, `api_key`, `embedded`, `scheduled`, `agent`, `voice`, `site`, `automation`, `mcp`, or `system`. Slack, realtime voice, automations and maintenance name their surface; other requests derive it once from the verified access path (a managed or local browser session is `web`, an API or configured key is `api_key`, signed delegation or an external actor is `embedded`, workspace MCP OAuth is `mcp`, an agent attempt is `agent`, and a validated Site origin is `site`, including follow-up Send and Steer from the Site bridge). A scheduled occurrence records `scheduled` and another agent's message records `agent`, so scheduled runs no longer look like generic system work; other machine turns inherit the session's latest surface. `origin` is unchanged. Embedding hosts that call core directly can pass `surface` to `createSessionForRequest` and `acceptSessionUserMessage`.

  The durable host export carries `surface` and `modelProvider` (the provider family from the turn's execution policy, with operator-configured providers reported as `registry`) on session events and usage facts, and `toolFamily` on `agent.toolCall.created` (a first-party tool name, `integration:<reviewed domain>`, or `custom`). The worker stamps `toolFamily` on the tool-call event payload. All values come from fixed lists and carry no content. Rolling migration 0533 adds the immutable, checked `session_turns.surface` column, the three export columns, and the `host_export_claim_analytics_sidecars` companion, which inherits the claim function's exporter grants. Published export function signatures are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 378327b: Emit one `agent.message.completed` per assistant message with its `phase` and, when the provider sent one, its `messageId`. Runtime normalization read a text field that Agents SDK message items do not have, so no per-message completion or phase ever reached events. Deltas now carry the phase a Responses provider declares, also through compact delta coalescing. An undeclared message gets the SDK's own rule: `commentary` when the same response asks for client tool work (including a client tool search) or ends with a later message, `final_answer` for the message the SDK returns. A Responses message completes as soon as it finishes, before the next message streams, instead of after the whole response. The worker skips the phase-less settlement copy once the stream completed the final text.

  Commentary is activity: it no longer marks a session unread (rolling migration 0527 indexes the new attention predicate), wakes `session_wait` change mode, becomes a Slack post, or enters the SDK chat reply. A turn that settles with only commentary still replies with its latest note. When a human or API message's turn ends waiting for input (`wait_for_input`), settlement records its latest assistant message on `turn.completed` as `reply` (the output stays empty; a child an agent spawned and a scheduled, automation or maintenance session's first turn record none), so a status answer given before waiting again marks the session unread and becomes a Slack post with the requester mention while delivery stays open for the result; stored history keeps the provider's phase. The SDK chat fold completes each segment by `messageId`, so a note completed after its answer streamed never repeats the answer. The MCP conversation view labels commentary, `latest: "terminal"` skips it, and the React timeline knows a streaming note is commentary from its first delta. `phase` stays optional.

  Older SDK clients see the new completions too: their live reply now separates a note from the answer that follows it in the same response with a blank line (it was run together before), and `history()` lists each completed note as its own assistant message. Roll the API before the workers: an older API process next to a newer worker can briefly post notes to Slack, wake `session_wait` change mode on them, and mark sessions unread for them.

- e14db2a: Recognize a ChatGPT account whose plan no longer includes the requested Codex
  model (an explicit plan refusal, `usage_not_included`, or an empty HTTP 400).
  The worker re-checks the account's current plan, excludes that account for that
  model only, and moves the same turn to another eligible account, or fails with a
  typed `codex_plan_entitlement` or `codex_request_rejected` code and plain copy.
  Plan metadata now refreshes from token refreshes and usage reads, a plan change
  is recorded as lasting evidence, the remote compaction request takes the same
  path, and each exclusion expires after 24 hours. Codex accounts report
  `planCheckedAt`, `planChangedFrom`, `planChangedAt`, and `planExcludedModels`.
- a5e93ba: Background commands that finish quickly but print a lot of output are now recognized as finished on the next background check instead of staying "running" for hours. Their sandbox can then save its workspace and go idle normally, instead of being held until the provider's 24-hour limit ends it. A command's saved output keeps its first 16 MiB and its final part, with a note where output was skipped.
- c4d0d1a: A person's message no longer retires a held `wait_for_input`. A finished turn that a person started (`source` `user` or `api`, or an operator's manual compaction) that does not call `wait_for_input` itself now leaves the session wait held, with its declaring turn, reason, and deadline unchanged. Previously, a status question answered while a child ran retired the wait, so the child's later result stayed pending with nothing to wake a goalless parent. A person's turn that claimed pending immediate machine input as coalesced context (for example, a child result that arrived just before the question ran) consumed what the wait was for, so it still retires the wait; coalesced deferred notices alone do not. Goal, system, scheduled, and other machine-input turns still supersede the wait, and its own deadline still bounds it. One shared predicate now decides the wait for worker peek and settlement, wake and claim admission, public `inputWait`, and waiting-descendant counts. No schema, prompt, or tool change.
- 3b58ff8: Signal the session workflow right away when an internal update (child result, Agent message, media result) joins a wake revision that has not been delivered yet, such as the future-dated `wait_for_input` deadline. The update still coalesces into that revision. Before this change it waited for the periodic dispatcher tick, which delayed a waiting parent's pickup of a child result by up to 10 s.
- 6f28afd: A definitively lost managed Modal sandbox no longer dead-ends its sessions. Shared sandbox groups (a parent with its children) now get the automatic checkpoint fallback, and every member receives the durable filesystem-discontinuity warning. When no checkpoint can be restored automatically (no archive, an unverified or legacy archive, an invalid artifact, or a definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure of the selected checkpoint), the whole quiescent group continues on a new empty workspace after a separate audited decision that warns every member the previous files are not available. Loss must be proven by a loss transition (a failed replacement box never counts), the empty workspace waits until the lost box is past its hard provider lifetime, other restore failures (including a missing archive object, now `archive_object_missing`, or unconfigured archive storage, now `archive_storage_unavailable`) retry the checkpoint with backoff and then wait for an operator, and a complete archive is never bypassed. Ambiguous provider states and live writers in any member still block, unknown command outcomes are never replayed, and the lost archive evidence is kept. Sessions stuck before this release recover on their next turn or Retry. The recovery projection adds `automaticLane` (`checkpoint` or `fresh_workspace`) and, for a timed wait, `availableAt` (when a Retry or a new message can decide again), and the failed-session banner says what Retry will do and when. Rolling migration 0548 requires warning protocol v3 to claim a session with an empty-workspace receipt.
- 32598eb: Expose content-free MCP phase timings and host-owned outbound trace correlation across gateway, credential, transport and persistence boundaries. Preserve W3C sampling flags, credential header semantics, exact execution authority and existing retry behavior.
- a6854a7: Allow completed turn owners to reach bounded Modal deadline capture without an interruption-only quiescence receipt. When the provider is definitively gone, select only a verified singleton CURRENT checkpoint for automatic continuity, persist a cache-stable filesystem warning before the agent runs, and fence old workers from affected sessions. Keep unknown command outcomes and unavailable or invalid archives fail-closed.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 5ab0b13: Remove the unconditional five-second grace period from normal session idle completion and child-result handoff. Keep the final durable work recheck, transactional idle settlement and parent-result deduplication, and close-race signal guard. Fence runnable machine input accepted before idle settlement as well as queued turns, preventing a stale parent result when input wins that race. Late follow-ups may start another workflow run of the same session through the durable wake path. A Temporal patch preserves legacy timer histories; held input waits, goal backoff, cancellation, quiescence, and capacity timers are unchanged.
- f68b176: Preserve workspace model access restrictions when renewing or reconnecting Claude, Anthropic, OpenRouter and Gateway credentials. Bound Claude HTTP error-body reads so stalled diagnostics cannot hide rate-limit/retry information. Associate Claude account-import help and validation errors with its accessible control.
- 8d19289: Allow a fresh exact operator checkpoint authorization after a completed public recovery, preserving the superseded recovery in the audit receipt without changing automatic recovery or active consent fences.
- 7a08660: Make a finished child's result carry its answer. An idle `child_terminal_result` now includes optional `payload.finalAnswer`: the child's newest result-bearing answer, frozen by the idle settlement, bounded to 8 KiB UTF-8 with a head/tail truncation marker and a `session_events` pointer to the full text (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswer`, `CHILD_TERMINAL_RESULT_FINAL_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES`). No answer is copied when the child's newest turn failed, was cancelled or superseded, or stopped at a segment limit. A turn claimed only to continue the child's goal (for example one that confirms and completes the goal after the answer) no longer replaces the answer: the answer is reported with that turn's output after it as `finalAnswer.goalContinuations`, whole when the parts fit the bound (`childTerminalResultFinalAnswerWithGoalContinuations`). Parts that do not fit are reported as the newest part, marked truncated, with `omittedSequences` and a `nextAction` that reads every part, so a child working across goal continuations still reports its final report. The walk stops at a non-answer outcome and at the child's newest goal activation, and a window holding only continuations reports the newest answer alone. The worker's enrichment upsert now keeps the committed answer and evidence instead of replacing them, and an untruncated answer serves as the parent claim's consumption evidence. When a parent's exact live attempt reads a direct child's complete answer through `session_wait` or `session_events` in its own model call (the worker now marks first-party calls with `_meta.opengeniCaller`, `FIRST_PARTY_MCP_CALLER_META_KEY`; Codemode calls do not count), the answer is recorded on the reading turn (`metadata.consumedChildAnswers`, `recordConsumedChildAnswers`) and `session_wait` stops counting that child's result as own pending input (`listOutstandingSessionSystemUpdatesForAttempt`). The attempt's successful completion settlement supersedes each still-pending idle result whose every part it received (`consumed_by_parent_read`), and a result the child commits after that completion is inserted already consumed, without a wake. A read by an attempt that fails or is interrupted suppresses nothing. The operational contract and the `session_create`, `session_wait`, `session_get`, `session_send_message`, and `wait_for_input` descriptions now price a child, prefer a direct answer or reusing an existing child, and steer multi-minute waits to `wait_for_input` instead of alternating `session_wait` and `session_get`. No tool is capped or removed.
- 57f030c: Retain failed scheduled occurrences when connection-account selection blocks
  dispatch. Run history includes structured connector/account identifiers and
  safe eligibility reasons without credential values or raw error messages.
  Replaying an occurrence retains its original outcome without admitting work.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled occurrence the scheduler refuses before running it is now a visible
  run instead of a thrown, retried activity or a silently dropped occurrence.
  `ScheduledTaskRun.admissionRefusal` (`{ version, reason, retryable }`, with
  `error` equal to `reason`) covers unprovable authority, an unavailable
  Connected Machine target, a missing Variable Set, a Sandbox Environment without
  an active version (terminal, status `failed`), and an inactive machine
  enrollment, insufficient credits or monthly limits (transient, status
  `skipped`; later occurrences run normally). Redelivery never adds a second run.
- 3f9c757: Scheduled tasks created by an organization or workspace API key (or the
  configured key) are now ownerless service schedules and run. Previously the
  key subject became the schedule's immutable owner, and every occurrence failed
  invisibly in the scheduler. An occurrence refused because its frozen authority
  cannot be proven is now recorded as a failed run with error
  `scheduled_authority_unavailable` instead of being retried to exhaustion with
  no run.
- 3f9c757: A scheduled run whose turn waits for a tool approval or a structured question
  is now visible: `ScheduledTaskRun.awaitingHuman` (`{ since, expiresAt }`) on run
  listings and `awaitingHuman` on the scheduled-task attention list, instead of the
  run looking merely "dispatched". The new optional
  `agentConfig.approvalTimeoutSeconds` (60 s to 30 days; default none) lets the
  scheduler reject the pending approval (or skip the question) as a labelled
  system decision once nobody answered in time, driven by a durable workflow
  timer.
- 1ffeb7c: The session terminal, Files, Git and desktop viewer open again for sessions whose Sandbox Environment has default Variable Sets the session did not select itself. A Variable Set the session can no longer use now answers 403 with its id instead of a bare 500, and the API logs the cause.
- 740bebd: A repeated default `skill_read` of the same Skill no longer returns the full `SKILL.md` again while that exact text is still in the session's active model history. The model receives a short `alreadyInContext` receipt with the current revision identity instead. Reads that compaction removed from history count as absent, so the next read returns full text. A stored read counts only if the current model receives it untruncated under its own tool-output bound, and a failed history lookup returns full text. Explicit `paths` (including `["SKILL.md"]`), `listFiles`, and Codemode callers always receive content. The tool schema, instructions, and Skill index are unchanged, so the cached prompt prefix is unaffected. `@opengeni/db` exports `getActiveSessionFunctionToolResults` for the active, call-paired results of one function tool.
- b28d5fa: Reading a session's stored bundled Skill selection now drops ids this build does not know instead of failing the whole session read. Dropping only narrows the stored selection; API input still rejects unknown ids, and keyed create replay still compares the exact stored selection. The bundled `document-parsing` guide now ships the upstream AnyDoc MIT license and a `SOURCES.md` attribution, the runtime package notices cover both AnyDoc-derived guidance copies, and the `skill_install` description no longer claims that `skill_search` returns library ids.
- e193b13: Add optional workspace-bot file-upload scope and an explicit, session-bound Slack retained-file delivery tool with durable upload checkpoints and uncertain-completion reconciliation. Existing bot installations remain eligible without files:write; administrators apply the canonical manifest and reinstall to enable uploads.
- 22e8ebf: The child-lifecycle outbox reconciler now delivers a backlog to parents in the order the rows were produced. The claim already selected pending rows oldest first, but returned them in the table's physical order, so a parent could receive sibling results out of completion order, or have an older progress notice supersede a newer one. Rolling migration 0528 returns the claimed rows sorted by `created_at`, then `id`; its signature and grants are unchanged.
- b99fd06: Keep task-tree authority's root-session lock compatible with foreign-key checks,
  preventing a cycle with concurrent child activity finalization while retaining
  writer serialization and exact attempt/visibility checks. Migration 0542 is
  rolling-compatible and preserves the function's owner and privileges.
- bcd9988: Give the model the current time without a tool call, and ask supported models for shorter answers. Each claimed user message now carries a separate `[Message sent <weekday> <date> <HH:MM> UTC]` part taken from the turn's durable acceptance time, and each delivered machine-input batch states its `deliveredAt` and every member's `createdAt` (scheduled occurrences add `Delivered:` and `Created:` lines). The times are persisted with the history row, never computed at inference time, and never enter `Agent.instructions`. Agent turns on the Codex subscription, direct OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses routes send `text.verbosity: "low"` for GPT-5-family and later models; the new optional `textVerbosity` agent option is omitted everywhere else, so Gateway, OpenRouter, SuperGrok, chat and other compatible routes are unchanged. `reasoning.summary` is unchanged. Realtime voice-call history now keeps a user message's separate parts on separate lines.
- 6f4be14: Lock the workspace before validating usage-event execution identities, preventing accounting inserts from deadlocking against session lifecycle writers. The rolling migration preserves execution validation, runtime authority, and retained usage history.
- c823664: New scheduled tasks and new web sessions now pick up the workspace default Sandbox Environment and the default Variable Sets it carries. A scheduled task that omits `rigId` stores the workspace default at creation, the way session create resolves it (an existing-session task keeps its target session's environment, a Connected Machine task stores none, and `null` still opts out); a later change to the workspace default does not move an existing task. Binding an environment to a task's generated sessions, whether by default, by an explicit `rigId` on create or edit, or by switching an existing-session task to generated sessions, now requires permission to attach that environment's default Variable Sets, as session create already did. In a workspace with a default, a Sandbox Environment picked in the composer applies to that session only and is no longer carried into the next new-session form, so later sessions return to the workspace default.

## 6.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 585f2c1: Add an operator-disabled ephemeral Chromium BrowserSession mode for disposable sandbox verification. Explicit requests use isolated browser contexts within a trusted actor and placement partition, preserve existing private-profile defaults, and become terminal after shared process loss instead of silently recreating or replaying work.
- a63a029: Reject Lightpanda placeholder images as screenshots and correct screenshot
  capabilities for existing semantic-only sessions. Keep DOM observation available.
- 4124c7c: Verify fresh conversation-history appends using their returned persisted rows instead of rereading numeric positions under row-level security while holding the session write lock. Existing-position retries retain exact content and turn checks, with atomic rollback on conflicts.
- 2563950: Add a database runtime kill switch for the one-time verified signup trial credit (rolling migration 0521). A grant now needs both `OPENGENI_VERIFIED_SIGNUP_TRIAL_CREDITS_ENABLED` and the newest row of the append-only `opengeni_private.verified_signup_trial_switch_revisions` table, which starts enabled. Operators flip it with the owner-only audited `set_verified_signup_trial_credits_enabled(enabled, operator, reason)` function. The change applies to the next setup transaction on every API replica, with no deploy or restart. Runtime roles can only read the switch. `readVerifiedSignupTrialSwitch` exposes the switch state, and the control worker publishes it as `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_runtime_enabled`, next to `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_deployment_enabled` for the master opt-in.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.

### Patch Changes

- cbb7aa4: Let a normally completed, closed turn owner reach bounded Modal deadline and repeated-provider-error capture without an interruption-only quiescence receipt. Failed or interrupted owners still require physical quiescence proof; checkpoint publication and other-writer fences are unchanged.
- 6fd328b: Restore a browser session when ending fails before controller dispatch.
- 9b9c6df: Mark a BrowserSession lost when its controller definitively reports that the browser no longer exists during suspension.
- 6eb431b: Allow authenticated hosts to replace an existing session MCP attachment with an accessible native connection through the standalone credential rotation API. An optional explicit replacement URL must match the native account's stored destination while the old URL remains a compare-and-set precondition. Preserve resource restrictions, version fencing, quiescence and idempotent receipts without replacing session history or accepted-attempt identity.
- f11a3e3: Compare connector policy snapshots by value when replaying an exact session attempt, so PostgreSQL JSONB key ordering cannot fail approval or human-handoff resume with a false ownership conflict.
- 36e1764: An exhausted model-provider quota no longer retries. A daily or monthly allowance (for example OpenRouter's `free-models-per-day` cap or a requests/tokens-per-day limit), a used-up quota (`insufficient_quota`), an account out of credits (HTTP 402), or a 429 whose provider retry hint exceeds 15 minutes now fails the turn at once with the new `provider_quota_exhausted` code, `retryable: false`, a `quotaScope`, plain-language copy, and the provider's text as `detail`, instead of five paced same-turn recoveries. Ordinary per-minute rate limits, and quota wording whose provider retry hint is a minute or less, remain `provider_rate_limited` and retryable. `@opengeni/runtime` exports the classifier (`classifyProviderQuotaError`), and model clients that let the OpenAI SDK retry classify the exact SDK error for a 429 and mark an exhausted one `x-should-retry: false`, so the SDK does not replay it either and both decisions always agree. Google's generic `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status and snake_case per-minute metric ids (Vertex `requests_per_minute_per_project`) stay retryable. A quota-refused compaction request records the same `quotaScope` marker, and failed session detail projects it. Codex and SuperGrok subscription transports keep their credential-rotation and capacity-wait semantics.
- f2ee81e: Count the one-time verified-signup trial grant as OpenGeni credits when resolving the default model for new work. Any positive credit balance now selects the configured credits default (after a saved workspace default or a connected subscription), and a balance at or below zero falls back to the deployment default.
- c1756ef: Make operational signals truthful: the session recovery backlog no longer counts effectively paused sessions as stale, a read-only first sandbox probe that finds no path is recorded as a completed startup phase, Knowledge index deferrals log a content-free cause, and repeated warnings can be throttled per key with a suppressed count.

### Patch Changes

- f4192b2: Restore an active browser session when a suspension fails before controller dispatch.

## 6.0.2

### Patch Changes

- c41aecd: Fix attached-browser event pagination and dedicated-tab creation, isolate concurrent macOS native capture helpers, separate still screenshots from live-stream reads, and serialize exact frame bytes. Preserve bounded controller diagnostics, read legacy browser capabilities conservatively, and respect explicit placement and identity when reusing interaction resources. Install matching agent and controller builds together; native capture uses protocol version 3.

  Clean up partially allocated virtual desktops when a required executable is missing instead of letting an unhandled spawn error terminate the controller.

- 7217a79: Retry pending tool receipt registration only after PostgreSQL deadlock or serialization rollback, with fresh attempt fences and bounded backoff. Reject conflicting duplicate call content without replaying inference or tool effects.

## 6.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d92af11: Keep original command text through ambiguous launch recovery and persist it separately from bounded previews. Preserve whitespace, mark clipped previews with an ellipsis, and show complete commands on expansion and hover.
- f60ca2b: Raise Skill folder limits eightfold to 1,024 files, 2 MiB per file, and 8 MiB total, while retaining bounded reads and existing validation.
- 56ddcfb: Resolve retained screenshots referenced by copied fork history through their original session, including existing and nested forks. Require recorded fork ancestry and a copied image receipt, retaining workspace and private-file access checks.
- 38b9857: Track child unread attention from meaningful content rather than housekeeping, and acknowledge complete parent-consumed results for the exact initiating human. Preserve newer unseen work and manual attention intent, decode retained evidence losslessly, and reconcile proven historical consumption conservatively. Requires maintenance migration 0503 before starting the matching attention-aware writers.
- 90e089a: Add a rollout-gated short MCP OAuth state that stores encrypted, time-limited callback context in Postgres. Preserve legacy in-flight callbacks and one-use replay protection.
- b1ad0c6: Start Slack tasks with the initiating user's saved website repositories, variable sets, compute and tool selections in the destination workspace. Preserve draft content, explicit empty tools, and ordinary resource authorization.
- a463199: Repair workspace control revisions behind their retained event frontier, preventing historical control replay on each fresh browser load. Reject subsequent revision rollback without altering pause state, timers, or historical events. Stop refreshing last-started model metadata for unrelated control changes.

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

### Minor Changes

- c64a94f: Support simultaneous authorized personal and workspace MCP account attachments with immutable account-qualified routing, sender isolation, and scheduled execution binding. Move attachment controls inside Connectors with readable ownership labels; keep account setup on the Capabilities page.
- 1c924ed: Add authorized, resumable literal search of saved user and completed assistant
  messages, including unloaded history. Workspace search can return one
  representative match per session; in-session Find returns every occurrence with
  stable event identity and original-text UTF-16 offsets. Requests and browser
  result batches remain bounded, with explicit continuation and provisional counts.

  Expose bounded exact-sequence history navigation and message highlighting for
  React hosts. The web console connects a contextual session-search dialog to
  full-history Find, preserves search state across navigation, and keeps ended
  conversations readable. Tool output, reasoning and unfinished delta-only
  assistant messages are outside the initial searchable scope. Exact Markdown
  matches use a labeled source excerpt that stays in place when Find closes;
  readers can explicitly restore the formatted message.

- 132b945: Add organization-owned integration acquisition policy with a discoverable catalog,
  revisioned administration API and SDK, and organization settings. Enforce selected
  provider and custom-protocol permissions on supported setup and installation paths
  at preparation and persistence boundaries.

  Preserve ordinary ownership and authorization, exact completed-request replay,
  unchanged reconciliation, cancellation and other reducing operations. Existing
  connection execution and credential refresh are not revoked by this policy.
  Deployment-configured tools and embedding-host session-local MCP configuration
  retain their existing admission rules; this is not a network or execution allowlist.

  Apply the organization integration policy migration and matching role provisioning
  with the matching runtime before enabling the setting. Older runtimes do not enforce
  the new acquisition policy. See `docs/organization-integration-policy.md` for the
  administration, identity, persistence and recovery contract.

- 779b16b: Add an account-authorized organization usage summary with bounded UTC periods,
  lossless metered totals, chart buckets, and paginated workspace totals. The
  organization Billing dashboard uses this summary instead of recent-event sums.

  Use a transaction-scoped, owner-only analytical capability to apply private
  session visibility once per session before aggregating. Separate workspace-page
  reads retain the selected cutoff and do not recompute organization totals.

- 7e2436a: Keep ordinary chat attachments out of Knowledge unless selected as useful evidence or a reusable reference. Distinguish supporting evidence from discoverable references, preserve exact originals and revisions, and add read-only collection and duplicate discovery before saving. Includes maintenance migration 0469; old runtimes must be drained before activation.
- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

### Patch Changes

- 4ddab4a: Preserve a warm snapshot's sole turn holder through its original bounded capture
  deadline, even after logical turn closure. Reaper sweeps must not steal a live
  finalizer's snapshot and extend interactive waiting with the drain capture budget.
  Expired claims remain recoverable, and closed attempts gain no execution authority.
- 59bad3f: Improve large session-history query plans with correlated scope statistics and an equivalent dynamic-owner RLS capability expression, preserving permissions, payloads and pagination.
- c31a951: Add connection-bound MCP tool permission discovery and Allow/Ask/Block management through the existing approval ledger, enforced consistently for direct tools and Codemode.

  Let workspace-default sessions inherit newly connected apps while retaining per-session connector exclusions and exact explicit selections. Present connected apps, logos, health, and reconnection in the composer connector menu. Keep internal runtime controls out of workspace settings and use Capabilities consistently in settings navigation.

- f90d628: Add explicit managed-human consent for same-session singleton Modal recovery from
  an exact older CURRENT checkpoint. Protect membership, route and artifact identity,
  retain durable replay receipts and generation provenance, and reconstruct a model
  warning before later inference. Separate consent from verified restoration and
  never replay failed commands. Refuse Retry on an unchanged blocked effective route
  without blocking an independently selected Connected Machine. Additive migration
  0495 keeps consent DB-disabled until operator-verified compatible rollout; permanent
  consent receipts reject old inference claims even after disabling consent or lease
  replacement. Only the warning-aware worker declares the scoped protocol.
  Preserve explicit failed-turn Retry after verified recovery or Connected Machine
  selection, and retain consent identity when post-accept status reads lose access.
  Keep fresh migration-before-role-provisioning and later runtime-role provisioning
  safe, with SELECT-only rollout access and owner-only activation.
- 348e54d: Use Sandbox Environment terminology in user-facing controls, errors, tool descriptions, and runtime guidance. Existing rig routes, tool names, IDs, permissions, and stored definitions remain unchanged.
- d1ab270: Persist configured skill catalogs as versioned conversation context, preserving prior prompt history across catalog updates, retries, compaction, and forks.
- f90d628: Repair user-owned device approval under a FORCE-RLS non-bypass database owner.
  Fence organization membership before tenancy and request locks, retain workspace
  membership row locks, and reject contention without a reverse-order wait.
  Requires the 0498 maintenance cutover; broader scoped-compute readers are not
  changed by this bounded enrollment repair.
- 0bf014d: Allow Codex subscription-source changes while work is active. Preserve accepted
  turns' original source through credential leasing, recovery, and capacity waits,
  while new work uses the workspace's selected source. Connecting a workspace
  subscription no longer overwrites an explicit source preference. Workspace
  connection controls remain available while inheriting organization subscriptions.
- c702159: Stop retrying permanent runtime database posture and configuration failures as
  connection errors. Validate local startup prerequisites, prevent overlapping
  launchers from rotating live database credentials, and check database posture
  before building the development sandbox.
- 3977932: Polish MCP OAuth consent for every client: shared OpenGeni chrome, organization and workspace pickers at authorize time, tokens that follow the chosen workspace, and token exchange that accepts any registered redirect URI.
- f90d628: Keep the global Modal orphan-safety inventory complete under a non-bypass migration owner without granting runtime roles cross-tenant table access.
- 9d5bb1c: Persist the periodic workspace capture attempt clock so failed snapshots respect the configured interval instead of blocking commands again on the next heartbeat. Forced recovery captures still bypass periodic cadence without bypassing ownership or active-capture fences.
- 621201d: Distinguish queued sessions from running agents and expose durable dispatch wait
  evidence in session detail reads, including retry timing and recorded errors.
- e261b39: Retain background command outcomes without starting a new agent turn unless the session is explicitly waiting for input. Let compatible command notices accompany later input without blocking messages behind a command backlog. Coalesce different originating turns only when their resolved human and complete inherited execution authority match, retaining original lineage and existing batch limits.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- f90d628: Keep the retry writer's activity-gated transaction explicit at the canonical
  writer boundary while binding its required recovery-route check through root
  composition. Preserve the writer audit and retry safety checks unchanged.
- 0bf014d: Add a session-authorized Codex account projection. Capacity retry choices follow
  the waiting turn's accepted subscription pool after source changes, including
  Disabled. Running turns keep their accepted account label while next-turn
  choices and workspace settings continue to use the current source.
- 6ed7dfb: Give session-message search a dedicated bounded HTTP metric label so its request latency and failures can be distinguished from unknown routes without recording search text or workspace IDs.

  The stock web app debounces committed search queries, keeps partial results on transient failures, and resumes failed scans from their last successful continuation instead of discarding progress. Authorization failures still clear retained content.

  Reduce long-message search database work by reusing the already-authorized event identity and scoped transaction, and coalescing adjacent scalar windows within the existing per-request budget. Literal Unicode matching, lossless offsets, live visibility checks, and ordinary conversation slice bounds are preserved.

- b0a5a54: Allow sharing a private session while work is running or queued, preserving its accepted human identity, selected connections and resource access. Viewer access still changes immediately; privatization and permission revocation remain fenced. Requires a maintenance migration.
- 1d6e49a: Preserve shared image attachments on service-triggered turns without human authority by matching the file ACL subject scope. Keep private files and protected Drive files inaccessible without the required authority, and restore the caller's database scope after lookup.
- 23d4542: Allow repeatedly unobservable, explicitly stopping managed commands to enter the existing checkpoint-before-termination recovery after owner quiescence and idle grace. Preserve running commands, all other writer fences, failed-checkpoint recovery, and real late exit proof.
- f90d628: Keep supervised commands out of legacy observation-error containment, including
  stale enrollment, checkpoint publication and published-capture teardown retries.
  Fence older control writers at the database boundary before enabling supervision.
- 9d9b94b: Expose named Plugin removal impact using the same classifier as Skill source
  release. Preserve customized/re-scoped Skills, resolve remaining owner names
  within workspace scope, and add optional preview-token fencing with refreshed
  409 previews when ownership or Skill state changes before confirmation. Retain
  Connection ownership, immutable Skill history, and human-only removal authority.

  Freeze the pre-comparison locked Skill head set through cleanup. A head made
  visible by another subject during confirmation now aborts removal with a refreshed
  409 preview instead of silently expanding the deactivation set.

- f7c9169: Support verified-email Google and GitHub sign-in linking and personal sign-in
  method management. Preserve canonical user ownership and email-verification
  checks, require recent authentication for sensitive changes, prevent removal of
  the last usable method, and respect explicit provider disconnection until a
  verified reconnect. Surface actionable callback feedback and security
  notification outcomes without granting integration access.
- 0ea365c: Route user-facing reports, including secondary audit outputs, to native document
  Artifacts before authoring. Persist explicit report requirements and require
  server-verified current-head inspection evidence at goal completion, preserving
  ordinary chat, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested
  local-file workflows. Keep unavailable or failed report delivery incomplete
  instead of silently substituting sandbox links.

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- de5569f: Allow native full organization API keys to administer host MCP resolver registrations. Align request authorization, live-key revalidation, and the database write trigger with the public key contract without granting human organization-admin permissions. Read-only, workspace-scoped, delegated, external-user, expired, and revoked credentials remain denied.
- 7746251: Prevent agent-authored workspace instruction changes from replacing the complete active policy, fence unsafe older pending revisions at approval, and show reviewers the current and proposed instruction text before approval.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- efeaa9c: Replace autonomous Memory and reviewed Knowledge authoring with structured Knowledge entries, exact revisions, evidence, groups and nonblocking review. Add centralized Agent learning defaults with chat and scheduled-task overrides, private original-file ownership, canonical source preparation and rebuildable retrieval. Retire legacy Memory/learning mutation APIs and SDK methods; migration 0461 requires a drained maintenance cutover and the matching runtime. See docs/knowledge.md and docs/deployment.md.

### Minor Changes

- ad9dc2f: Add a non-provisioning external identity lookup and opt-in, operation-keyed service workspace onboarding. Cancellation-bearing revocation reuses native membership teardown and the organization-workspace receipt ledger to fence a delayed grant, including when no membership exists yet. Legacy unkeyed onboarding remains unchanged and cannot be fenced retroactively.
- da4a85f: Add native organization-admin MCP credential resolver registration by stable workspace externalSource. Support encrypted, idempotent generation-checked endpoint/secret rotation and revocation with fail-closed namespace routing and live physical-use fencing. Existing accepted participant, schedule and child authority remains unchanged. Migration 0463 requires maintenance and matching API/worker binaries.

### Patch Changes

- 50ac837: Add explicit accepted-turn host binding selection for shared conversations. Capture each participant's exact owner delegation without changing the configured destination or borrowing creator credentials, preserve fixed bindings and scheduled/child live authority checks, and apply session-local server configuration to follow-up selection. Document the supported empty-session then first-text admission flow.
- 71fd840: Accept Microsoft's token responses that omit offline_access from access-token scopes. Require a refresh token as proof of offline access, preserve that capability after refresh, and continue rejecting missing resource permissions.
- 123cf57: Make agent-authored workspace instruction changes non-destructive: append new rules by default, require one exact anchor for edits or removals, and reserve complete replacement for an explicit mode while preserving baseline conflict checks and instruction budgets.

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e41027c: Add opt-in MCP operation outcome recovery through a configured read-only provider receipt tool. Persist exact operation identity before dispatch, retain original invocation outcomes separately from late receipts, and revalidate current authority across accepted attempts without replaying mutations. Preserve arbitrary SDK call IDs as correlation rather than replacing UUID operation identity.

  Apply the additive operation-ledger migration and runtime-role provisioning, and upgrade all claim-capable workers to the membership-first lock order before enabling provider mappings. Providers must implement the documented observation contract; unsupported providers and historical operations without captured authority are not automatically recoverable.

- 935af4e: Add an authorized standalone session inline MCP credential rotation operation with durable idempotent receipts, exact destination and credential-version fencing, and atomic quiescence checks. Expose the operation through HTTP and the SDK without sending messages, scheduling work, retrying external mutations, or widening connection or attempt authority. Keep existing message-bound credential updates unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 4e2b59d: Deduplicate concurrent computer-session preparation across both operation unique indexes while preserving workspace-scoped replay and immutable request checks.
- a1bb8db: Preserve sender attribution for initial and follow-up user messages in host exports by resolving their exact triggering turn. Canonical events, existing exports, and checkpoints remain unchanged.
- 488a69b: Expose bounded current-failure evidence on session detail reads so recovery diagnostics do not depend on timeline pagination. Show recorded consecutive retry streaks without inventing lifetime totals, and distinguish Codex account assignment, affinity/lease reuse, and actual switches without changing allocation policy.

  Read session status and its replay cursor coherently, decode bounded diagnostics through the lossless storage codec, and record account transitions atomically against the current assignment with attempt-keyed replay and compatible switch reasons.

- 22a9e4d: Bound sandbox acquisition and workspace mutation waits across repeated archive capture attempts. Honor the first observed capture's persisted timeout once, without letting expired or renewed claims replenish the caller's deadline; retain all capture and writer fences.

  Release an exact unpublished drain capture after its provider promise rejects, including after a local timeout, so waiting turns can resume the intact live sandbox. Unresolved captures, published archives, successors, and provider teardown remain fenced.

  Fresh claims allocate a new provider request identity; uninterrupted replacements retain it, preventing stale snapshot replay after an intervening writer re-arms the lease.

### Patch Changes

- e1a50ba: Spool Linux host-backed workspace archives through capture, object storage, and cold restore instead of materializing whole JSON/base64 payloads. Isolate each upload at a fresh physical locator and verify stored bytes without assuming conditional-PUT support. Preserve legacy locators, archive format, configured restore limits, and lease capture/publication authority; retain candidates after ambiguous publication outcomes.

### Patch Changes

- a9cc903: Allow workspace artifact mutations from service turns that retain an immutable causal human only while the exact live attempt, selected artifact tool, publish permission, and interruption fences all hold. Document that the causal-human field is never standalone authorization, and continue to reject pure service work and stale attempts.

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6a60a58: Canonicalize typed Skill review cards using host-owned choices. Allow explicit
  authorized Save/Don't save responses to existing exact-bound cards with the
  legacy Other flag and null option descriptions, without rewriting cards,
  manufacturing consent, or weakening human, tenant, turn, or revision fences.
  Apply rolling migration 0458; pre-0435 runtimes remain unsupported.

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Use authenticated canonical users instead of session end-user labels. Session
  creation rejects caller-supplied identity scope; list filters use scopeSubjectId.
  Chat user mode uses asUser and explicit workspace membership, while collaborators
  address the same session ID. Reopen legacy user-namespaced chats by session ID.

  Retire active session Memory in favor of task notes. Historical session Memory
  remains stored and old selectors hydrate as off, never workspace. User Memory
  uses the verified active-turn user. Preserve frozen scheduled agent-reach policy.
  Migration 0457 requires the documented maintenance cutover and matching writers.

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

## 4.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 87fbd92: Preserve full session messages and tool output through database paging, compact
  event delivery, SSE, browser rendering, and copying. Remove browser per-event
  preview truncation while retaining history pagination and backpressure. Events
  larger than a page or loaded-window byte target are delivered intact on their own.
- 5835c27: Reduce database round trips for large session-event history pages by fetching up to 256 rows per internal batch. Preserve the existing full-payload transfer byte budget, exact event content, pagination cursors, and tenant isolation.
- eb21b93: Allow explicitly audited operator recovery from an exact historical sandbox checkpoint while preserving generation gaps and existing restore verification.

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 068be26: Complete a Skill save in the same transaction as its one verified human chat decision. Show the full immutable Skill folder, preserve exact scope and revision checks, and refuse delegated, stale, or mismatched approval. Autonomous saves activate directly; declining a proposal preserves existing active guidance.
- 69924e8: Preserve structured model-history ordering through PostgreSQL replay and pending-tool recovery. Retain authorized uploaded images across turns and compaction input, preserve images in retained messages, and include their projected token cost in compaction retention budgets. Migration requires draining writers.
- 9233c88: Fix SuperGrok disconnect failing when sessions are pinned to the account. Clear
  the credential pin and its source atomically, preserving stale-update fencing.
- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9827c25: Add message action slots and an optional source message boundary for managed-human forks. The web UI places turn feedback and Fork from here beside Copy and the timestamp. Message forks preserve existing authorization and idempotency, copy only the selected canonical history prefix, and reject ambiguous, compacted, or incomplete boundaries.

  Migration 0429 requires draining the API and both worker pools and provisioning the updated runtime routine contract before starting the new binary.

### Patch Changes

- 231b103: Apply explicit Codex account switches and unpins to capacity-blocked turns, preserving the same turn and history through recovery. Display current account selection separately from future preferences and report when a switch requests a capacity recheck.
- 392c575: Retain Modal command handles, provider execution identities, output, and exact exit status across provider-client reconstruction. Persist stream pages before acknowledging their cursors, and treat unavailable historical locators as unknown rather than proof of process loss. Execution status is provider-owned and never read from sandbox-writable files.
- 7e73418: Repair protocol-0 continuation admission to consider every explicitly selected personal Variable Set, preserving current-owner, grant, authority-epoch and causal-attempt fences. Include rolling migration 0430 in the published database package.
- 14dd6fe: Add workspace transcription provider preferences and optional fallback after explicit rejection, preserving recording pins after uncertain or successful attempts. Refresh expired SuperGrok credentials and recover the provider's invalid-credential 403 response.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4536385: Expose independently configurable GitHub action approval policies for routine writes, review submission, and pull-request merges, while preserving capability-first defaults, explicit policies, and attempt-frozen execution authority.
- fa12951: Separate command interaction from session history. Add bounded retained-output command reads and use the same operation for command waits. Terminal reads observe completion and suppress only still-pending completion notifications; running reads, claimed notifications, and historical tool results remain unchanged.

  Make session history conversation-first with complete-message pagination and explicit results, tools, and debug views. Preserve cursor detail selection, provide oversized-message continuation, and keep queued prompts distinct from processed conversation. Update concise model guidance for the new surfaces.

  `command_wait` now uses `waitSeconds`, an output cursor, and the same flat result as `command_read`; clients using the previous command wrapper must update. Apply the additive command-observation migration before starting the new readers.

- d9dbd5d: Add authenticated general feedback and session/turn ratings with exact comments,
  author attribution, idempotent submission, and private-session isolation.
- c90f3fc: Make workspace tool and plugin defaults independently inheritable. Add explicit reset patches, preserve existing custom lists, and prevent unrelated plugin saves from freezing built-in defaults. Show inherited/custom mode and partial group counts, with deliberate customization and inspectable individual tools.
- 0c39126: Add per-connection turn-model permissions and organization workspace assignment
  for subscriptions and model gateways. Migration 0424 requires draining APIs and
  workers; do not restart older workers after policies are enabled.

  Fix organization Codex sign-in in local mode without granting managed-human reset-credit ownership to the local administrator.

- 0c39126: Add organization SuperGrok subscription pools with multiple accounts, active selection, rotation, and shared/Personal workspace inheritance. Preserve the exact subscription scope of accepted work and organization-only management authority. Unify Codex and SuperGrok account rows and connection actions in the web settings.

  Maintenance migration 0423 requires draining API and workers before upgrading. Older workers cannot parse the organization subscription scope.

- b1d3673: Add the `@opengeni/sdk/chat` facade (`OpenGeni`, `Chat`, `createChatHandler`, Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI adapters) and the `@opengeni/react/chat` drop-in component. Sessions gain `agentAccess`, an opaque `endUser` label, and `memoryScope`, enforced in the session-authorization seam so one workspace per customer can hold isolated, per-user, or shared chats. Organization API keys gain `access: "read"` and `GET /v1/organizations/:id/sessions`. Close the tool-widening paths: child tool selection, agent tool-policy updates, scheduled-task sessions, and the Codemode SDK proxy can no longer exceed the creating session.

  Private-memory identities use bounded hashes of exact source/user tuples. Correction, archival, and replacement enforce the private writable scope. Chat reload restores unresolved approvals and questions, and the chat component uses the complete human-input form with multiple selections and Other answers.

  Session-scoped discovery preserves the embedding host's allowlist. Responses streams emit the complete message/content lifecycle with stable per-response IDs, including incomplete settlement for human waits and cancellation. Streaming text preserves the same paragraph separators as the final reply.

- 0a81cc8: Add durable workspace pause/resume timers with duration controls, countdowns,
  manual cancellation, and idempotent worker execution. Migration 0420 requires a
  maintenance deployment: drain old writers and deploy matching API/workers.

### Patch Changes

- 22a6704: Correct oversized session-message continuation with bounded source slicing, preserve typed runner terminal failures during command observation, and keep retained command output readable when live refresh encounters a recognized temporary transport failure. Refresh fallback rechecks API authorization and explicitly marks unavailable freshness; it does not mask integrity or authorization errors.
- 7dac7e3: Decode bounded session-monitoring progress scalars with their persisted lossless codec version. Preserve canonical prefixes and explicit truncation without reporting encoded storage lengths as original character counts. Clarify that completion joins use the last consumed event cursor, not a session snapshot watermark that may already include an unread child result.

  Validate the complete stored progress scalar before decoding its bounded prefix, preserving literal malformed codec markers even when an invalid suffix lies beyond the read boundary.

- 8db607e: Make GitHub connector writes capability-first when no explicit workspace action policy matches, while preserving explicit Allow, Ask, and Block decisions.
- d8b0012: Keep parked child waits and active goals from reporting successful completion to their parent. Preserve durable wake deadlines and actual terminal result delivery.
- fa2b99a: Preserve workflow wake retries until pending input is admitted, while future waits stay parked at their deadline, and expose current session waits and waiting descendant counts. Refresh wait status on live events and retain the status projection sequence so newer session reads cannot be overwritten by older events.
- 5cc0aac: Keep workspace Codex source changes, automatic account assignments, and last-used account bookkeeping from changing conversation recency or session ordering. Explicit account switches and semantic session activity retain their existing behavior.
- 341a7f6: Preserve exact command-launch and wait-timeout causal authority, keep separate humans in separate claims, and recover only proven unconsumed pre-claim failures without extending personal grants.
- c1dc59b: Default sessions_list and session_get MCP results to compact actionable discovery and child-management state. Retain the legacy bounded projections through detail: full, including effectiveToolPolicy for configuration inspection. Make related-work evidence opt-in for plain compact browse while automatically retaining search evidence and its advisory-only authority facts. Preserve exact cursors, goal completion evidence, pause reasons, and REST/UI defaults; keep target-only ancestor control redacted in both detail modes.
- ac7e07c: Retire background-command tracking after a connected agent instance is replaced, explicitly stopped, or revoked. Preserve historical records without waking old sessions, drain cleanup batches promptly, and scope session stopping counts to the requested trees.
- cc1bfe0: Keep filtered session rows consistent with their selection, track concurrent folder detachment in activity revisions, bound sparse creator lookups, and reject timestamp precision that cannot be preserved.
- ba9e5a4: Preserve the exact causal human on child lifecycle follow-up turns so personal session resources remain admissible, isolate child/goal causal claims from complete Agent Steer identities and malformed authority-bearing updates, keep atomic pre-claim database failures—including replay-compatible disposition-only results—retryable instead of terminally discarding pending work, and provide a root-only, failure-epoch-fenced repair whose idempotency receipt binds the exact recovery authority for sessions terminalized by older workers.
- c69ad5f: Preserve externally managed history across opaque compaction checkpoints and verify conversation persistence before continuation. Reject shifted history prefixes and conflicting saved items instead of silently losing completed work.
- 123a72a: Keep managed-human workspace grants scoped to organizations where the subject has an active membership.
- 1c4b707: Expose goal_resume so agents can resume any paused goal without a pause-reason restriction; include it for existing sessions with goal_pause.
- cc1bfe0: Add cursor-bound project, creator, and date filters to session pages so grouped sidebars can load older sessions independently within the group being viewed.
- 414946c: Inherit model, effort and speed from the latest started turn for follow-ups and voice handoffs. Project the same policy in session reads, fresh drafts and Insights without changing accepted turns or stored creation settings.
- b1d479b: Repeat Pause on an already-paused session to re-arm its missing exact-attempt quiescence reconciliation without resuming work.
- 64c7c5c: Allow Personal workspaces to inherit their organization's Codex subscription pool and select an explicit source while retaining organization-only credential management. Keep Personal session creation available when optional Only-me session tenancy is unavailable.

  Activate inheritance through maintenance migration 0422 after draining old API and worker processes. Include Personal workspaces in organization Codex source-change protection and capacity wakeups.

- 6e167eb: Preserve the supplied admission failure message and classified cause on the durable session failure event when no turn could be claimed.
- 575af5b: Expose workspace project management through MCP, including shared pins/order, session filing, project-filtered discovery and project selection at session creation. Bundle concise, on-demand project organization guidance for every agent, independent of compute backend and retain existing session authorization checks.
- b43a821: Prevent concurrent organization recovery dispatchers from claiming the same notification from an old statement snapshot. Preserve immutable delivery evidence and require READ COMMITTED claim transactions.
- 6de9fe3: Preserve newer composer draft content and project provenance when a stale realtime create records selection history, while exposing optional project provenance consistently across contracts and SDK types. Store project provenance in rolling-upgrade-safe additive draft columns behind a metadata fence, concurrent partial index, bounded resumable backfill, and separately committed validation; dual-write mixed-version draft writers without holding schema locks across legacy-row scans. Avoid passive hydration autosaves and honor the latest route launch intent when hydration completes.
- 732bece: Park sandbox rotation recovery until durable lease progress, and wake the exact waiting turn when provider loss, failed warming, reaping, or teardown release ends its rotation wait.
- 19c51e2: Preserve exact canonical producer authority when a concurrent reusable scheduled occurrence binds after session materialization, using the existing source-to-target receipt without weakening grant revalidation.
- baa1c36: Match scheduled-run admission to the target session's tool-inheritance semantics.
  An omitted turn override inherits session tools instead of being mistaken for an
  explicit empty override. Explicit overrides and policy-drift rejection remain
  unchanged.
- 380bba5: Preserve scheduled generated-session recovery after a model switch by validating stored creation policy separately from the latest-started display policy.
- cda46e8: Resolve session schedule indicators from current indexed schedule targets, including paused schedules. Add a session-filtered schedules list so existing chats link to all schedules targeting them without reading workspace schedules in the browser.
- c1dc59b: Project persisted and effective session tool-policy provenance through the existing related-session access boundary. Target-only reads no longer reveal an unauthorized ancestor through inheritedFromSessionId, including when full MCP detail rebuilds effective policy afterward; root-authorized lineage and all other policy fields remain unchanged.
- 2fb17fd: Track published Site session origin automatically; add origin-filtered session
  listing and skill defaults for reusable in-Site conversations. Site provenance
  remains independent of project placement and session authorization.
- 107aa14: Support standard SDK/React conversations in Sites and sandbox previews, direct
  HTML/source uploads, exact deployment package pins, and embedded layout/queue
  defaults. Refresh exhausted Grok capacity after external resets.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6f84c02: Make durable Codex credential leasing unconditional, preserve rotation-off as an active-account-only capacity policy, and recover definitive credential failures through same-turn failover or durable capacity waiting.

### Minor Changes

- 6b65383: Replace goal-scoped long waits with self-only session-level `wait_for_input`, add provider-neutral `command_wait`, and deliver terminal background-command proof as exactly-once durable agent input with workflow wakes for nonterminal sessions while preserving event-only audit for terminal sessions.

### Minor Changes

- b420912: Show the exact model-visible system instructions, tools, skills, and token counts in the session Debug inspector.

### Patch Changes

- fab39d2: Keep lazy session-history reads sub-second on large sessions by fitting each browser window and its continuation lookahead into one byte- and count-bounded database query instead of walking the page through sequential reads. Fresh and foreground tail loads may use one additional bounded page to preserve a complete turn boundary, and foreground replacement keeps the prior timeline visible until the new window is ready.

## 3.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 38de50d: Enable Workspace Memory by default, require approval by default for agent-derived Workspace instructions and Skills, and use the clearer Require approval label for workspace and organization governance settings.
- 8b42f58: Add the managed-human API, SDK, and atomic tenant lifecycle for creating additional organizations with an isolated Personal workspace and a first shared team workspace.
- 0214875: Price model usage with a 5% default markup and dedicated cache-write rates, and show provider estimates, equivalent OpenGeni credit prices, and actual credit-path prices separately in Insights.
- 7c5897f: Preempt sandbox writers and persistent interaction holders at the provider-deadline rotation lead boundary so the zero-holder reaper can capture the exact workspace generation before provider destruction.
- e2a668b: Add the built-in, instruction-only OpenGeni Product Integration Pack for adaptive, tenant-safe customer integrations, with explicit per-session activation that prevents its implementation guidance from entering ordinary customer chats.
- ae19409: Enforce idle-boundary admission for skip-overlap scheduled sessions.

### Patch Changes

- a5ca001: Keep provider-deadline interaction cleanup visible under FORCE RLS for lease-free controllers, prevent unrelated overdue leases from starving the bounded deadline batch, and clean already-draining Modal leases at their deadline.
- Updated dependencies [8f81b57]
  - @opengeni/contracts@2.11.0
  - @opengeni/codemode@0.4.24
  - @opengeni/config@0.23.1

## 3.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2d0fad4: Add deployment-defined model catalogs and cost policy, workspace-managed Gateway and OpenRouter credentials plus custom models, a separate deployment-managed OpenRouter rail, live catalog refresh, the `list_models` agent tool, and model-picker/API/SDK support for the new catalog surfaces.
- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- f5e2dfc: Keep canonical large session-event payloads lossless while exporting an explicit bounded host projection, so optional host export cannot roll back session lifecycle settlement.
- bcacd54: Release durable BrowserSession and ComputerSession holders when a requested finite-lifetime Modal lease reaches its hard provider deadline, preserve honest operation outcomes, and expose interaction-blocked rotation telemetry.
- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.
- 5ef0757: Allow zero-holder sandbox drains to use a separate extended provider snapshot timeout without lengthening ordinary periodic or turn-end snapshot finalization, while keeping current and historical Modal rotation admission inside provider-deadline headroom and making opted-in lifecycle waiters honor an in-flight child's persisted bounded capture deadline across rolling configuration changes.
- 9af1666: Keep backward session-history pagination advancing across oversized legacy events by applying the canonical bounded read projection instead of failing the page, and report when a forensic response is no longer byte-for-byte exact.

### Patch Changes

- 3589136: Release abandoned shared rig setup ownership as soon as the superseded turn proves its sandbox writers are physically quiesced.

## 3.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 463c709: Reset provider recovery backoff after a fenced successful model request so intermittent outages cannot exhaust a long-running turn's consecutive retry budget.

## 3.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 3a7fe2f: Reconcile retained-process terminal settlement races without leaving completed routes pinned.
- 4fb337b: Reconcile stale Codex quota cooldowns from authoritative live usage without clearing generic rate limits or concurrently newer refusals.
- 478f572: Harden organization API keys with explicit credential provenance, fail-closed revocation of ambiguous legacy account keys, bounded delegation, atomic organization-key and workspace limits, and safer rotation and one-time-secret UI behavior.
- 5b9acd1: Make session attention monotonic across rapid navigation and nested trees. Failed sessions now remain red only until the viewer or their parent agent acknowledges the latest event, while historical failure lifecycle state remains intact.

## 3.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c3b43a5: Expose bounded durable recovery-backlog metrics from every control worker and alert when closed recoverable attempts remain without active ownership or a settled session projection.
- fab355b: Allocate canonical session event sequences from the locked narrow cursor while retaining the session-row compatibility projection.
- b471a90: Add an organization-owner Off, Review first, or Autonomous policy for agent-managed organization identity, including owner-only API and SDK controls, exact-attempt automatic activation, immutable receipts, and the organization settings control.
- e41285f: Overlap optional MCP preparation with first inference even when artifact tooling is enabled, keep optional eager integrations off the first-token critical path, reuse immutable large-history projections incrementally, and expose fenced event-append phase latency without changing durable ordering.
- 1f289a0: Attach machine input that arrived during a structured human-input wait to the resumed logical turn after its open tool-call result, while leaving post-resume arrivals for the next turn.
- c9ac869: Make the narrow session-event cursor authoritative for public sequence and unread projections, and isolate accepted raw exact-attempt batches from the wide session-row lock while preserving legacy SQL writer compatibility.
- fab355b: Add the rolling, parity-checked narrow session-event cursor foundation for a later sequencer cutover.
- fab355b: Lock and parity-check each narrow session event cursor in the canonical event and control writer prefix before turn and attempt locks.
- 4bacdd3: Add fixed-scope organization API keys, idempotent external tenant workspace provisioning, Personal-workspace exclusion, and the matching SDK and integration guidance.
- 72de39c: Retain low-cardinality workspace deletion phase, inventory, and total transaction metrics with exact workspace identifiers confined to structured logs.

## 3.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 699477a: Restore autonomous agent Workspace Memory writes whenever workspace Memory is enabled. Agents can save and correct active facts, decisions, incidents, fixes, and outcomes independently of Learning mode while all existing Memory kinds remain retrieval-only through search. Autonomous learning may activate eligible concise Workspace instructions and focused Skills through their governed, auditable, undoable lifecycles; Review first keeps proposals inactive and Off creates no derived change.
- ddce5cc: Allow scheduled generated sessions and nested workers to target an exact Connected Machine, and fail closed without leaving an unstarted generated session behind when that route cannot be established.

### Patch Changes

- 3ef2488: Coordinate immutable Rig setup once per exact sandbox lease epoch and provider instance while keeping credentials, repositories, and files turn-private.

### Patch Changes

- 551cead: Return durable retained-process exit or loss results to shell tools instead of rendering a retryable platform fault for an already-terminal command handle.
- 06fda28: Return bounded stable-key conflict outcomes for governed preference proposals instead of exposing persistence query details.

## 3.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 8dc432d: Settle interrupted native tool-search calls with the provider correlation identity retained in provider metadata.
- c705de3: Bound session-control settlement reads to the requested session subtrees, avoid redundant workspace refreshes for session-scoped control events, and add low-cardinality MCP lifecycle telemetry with failure, latency, and runtime reliability alerts and dashboards.

## 3.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 17d253b: Complete personal GitHub identity support across managed, self-hosted, and local modes. Add a compact connect-and-repository UI, exact local-human authority persistence, Docker-safe credential brokering, durable child and goal propagation, and reviewed GitHub tools for pull-request reviews and merges without exposing provider tokens to agents.
- ff4af61: Promote a normal human Send to Steer-equivalent replacement when an active session is waiting for human action, cancelling the stale decision surface and placing the conversational message directly in chat.
- c116379: Improve organization and workspace administration with compact people management, workspace-admin member controls, personal integration and Codex subscription setup, clearer permission presets, consistent connector presentation, and organization-scoped resource navigation.
- c116379: Recover sessions containing legacy duplicate native tool-search pairs and prevent crash settlement from appending another pair when the provider correlation id is stored only in provider data.

## 3.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 18afc44: Accept native tool-search results whose correlation id is carried only in provider metadata.
- bc88a28: Keep recoverable sessions durably wakeable until exact attempt quiescence, including when a retained process settles after the workflow's final reconciliation check.
- 3a004ff: Preserve optional structured human-input answers, replay terminal settlements idempotently, and retain Slack replies when expiry or cancellation wins a response race.

## 3.5.1

### Patch Changes

- da0c2d2: Prevent accepted-attempt workspace learning-policy snapshots from deadlocking with ordinary session lifecycle writers. The snapshot function now locks the workspace, session, turn, and attempt explicitly in the canonical order, then revalidates the complete live-attempt and interruption tuple in a fresh statement before deriving the immutable policy snapshot.
- 92f227f: Make session and workspace Pause/Resume desired-state mutations report authoritative changed, unchanged, and replayed outcomes. Represented no-ops no longer allocate control revisions, events, interruptions, or wakes, while newer descendant overrides and missing lifecycle repairs still produce real mutations. First-party MCP session control now returns the same versioned mutation receipt for agent-bound and sessionless callers.

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a7912ea: Add a one-click, owner-authorized OpenGeni Lens GitHub App installation flow for the PR Review Pack, backed by durable single-use OAuth authority, shared signed-webhook routing, and exact-repository least-privilege installation tokens. Keep bring-your-own GitHub App, GitLab, and Azure DevOps registration as the provider-neutral advanced path.
- 986f5fe: Add provider-neutral browser login session sets with bounded independently revocable slots, explicit actor switching, isolated add and re-authentication, scoped logout, non-enumerating cross-slot deep-link recovery, and rolling legacy/dual/broker compatibility.
- 6e12f3a: Add canonical-human organization recovery custody with exactly three accepted custodians, two-person approval, a fixed seven-day cooldown, promotion-only co-owner execution, durable notification evidence, and immutable workspace organization ownership.

### Patch Changes

- d7ab403: Bundle Workspace Insights usage and model projections into bounded analytical reads while preserving filter, visibility, and UTC boundary semantics.
- 9ef491b: Add the Agent Knowledge product surface, Personal workspace knowledge views and defaults, workspace learning-autonomy administration, explicit routing guidance between Memory, Skills, and Workspace instructions, authority-first organization Document search, exact replay-safe confirmed Memory materialization, and the narrower organization identity/mission boundary with richer facts retrieved from organization knowledge.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 76d6396: Generate concise topic-oriented session titles with a prompt-free fallback, automatic-title safety normalization, custom-role and old-image rolling-compatible least-privilege database posture, and UI projections that never use raw initial prompts as display names. Durable title fanout now requires a versioned subscriber-recovery capability: managed NATS and supported embedded brokers coalesce one Postgres catch-up after reconnect, while legacy buses without that contract fail readiness/worker startup before durable rows can be acknowledged.
- b5071cf: Require every Rig to layer setup and checks on the deployment-managed platform sandbox, reject new explicit Rig image overrides, keep provider-native image ids out of durable lease identity, and verify Browser, Terminal, and Computer services before publishing a Rig provider image.

## 3.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8fabf12: Document the one-way deployment boundary for named signup and invited-user
  setup. Migration 0348 requires every API, control worker, and turn worker to be
  stopped and drained before it runs, with the exact old/new application database
  roles supplied to the migration runner. Start only binaries built for schema
  ordinal 0348 or newer after it commits; never restart a pre-0348 image, and
  remain in maintenance to fix forward if the new runtime cannot start.
- 8fabf12: Repair realtime human-authority routing and metrics, personal Document reads
  under FORCE RLS, private-session visibility transition checks, and
  tenant-scoped session-tenancy fencing through migrations 0343-0345.

  Migration 0345 is a one-way maintenance cutover. Stop and drain every API,
  control worker, and turn worker before applying it, then start only binaries
  built for schema ordinal 0345 or newer. Never restart a pre-0345 image after
  the migration commits: its session-tenancy writes do not enter the required
  workspace fence and will fail closed.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 47b88d3: Add explicit managed onboarding: ordinary verified signup completes an organization-name-only setup that creates only the owner membership and canonical Personal workspace, while unregistered invitees can use a digest-only one-time account setup link before signing in normally.
- c5e4684: Expose bounded organization-admin audit APIs and SDK methods for Default-collection backfill runs, operations, workspace receipts, and organization-wide Document authority reclassifications.
- dc10a36: Let an administrator see and set which OpenGeni workspace each Slack channel starts work in, from the Slack capability sheet. A channel with no choice is not broken: it asks the first person who uses it and remembers the answer, and the sheet says so.

### Patch Changes

- d47da57: Add bounded connection-authority convergence evidence with global residual totals, fixed operator actions, deterministic membership remediation, and fail-closed command completion.
- 977fa0f: Add durable provider-neutral invited-user email delivery with scope-bound retention fences, ambiguity-preserving retries, digest-only setup preview, and explicit delivery state across the API, SDK, and organization administration experience.
- ba29352: Automatically activate session tenancy for an exact newly inserted Personal-only organization after the canonical deployment boundary, with atomic setup, private-setting, and greenfield evidence receipts.
- 9d251cb: Add server-owned viewer, member, and administrator roles for shared organization workspaces, an explicit Personal/shared workspace kind, a privacy-safe administration projection, and audited idempotent grant and revocation commands.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f30555c: Add atomic same-workspace session forks with an explicit private or workspace destination. Private-to-workspace copies require a durable acknowledgement, workspace members may fork a shared source into fresh authority of their own, and private sources remain owner-only. Exact applied receipts remain recoverable by the same live workspace actor after mutable source authority changes, while changed requests conflict and fresh keys still require current source authority. Every fork receives fresh authority, provenance, root, and sandbox-group identity without inheriting live grants, credentials, Connections, turns, goals, MCP, resource attachments, processes, or pins. The managed web control now exposes the generic Fork dialog to authorized shared-session members and verifies the returned owned destination before navigation.
- cb116e0: A parent turn that consumes a child's lifecycle update now acknowledges that child for the turn's initiating human, exactly as if they had opened and viewed it. An orchestrator that fans out to dozens of children used to leave a blue unread dot on every one of them forever, even though the parent agent had already consumed and acted on each result; the claim transaction that turns a batch of `session_system_updates` into durable model input now also advances that human's `session_pins.acknowledged_sequence` on every child the batch reports on, to the child's `last_sequence` at that instant.

  The rule is keyed only on "a claimed turn consumed a child lifecycle update, and that turn has a frozen initiating human", so it covers all six child lifecycle kinds, behaves identically at every level of a nested chain, and has no orchestrator-, goal-, or depth-specific special case. Several notices for one child in a single batch produce one acknowledgment, and a turn whose frozen principal is purely a service acknowledges nothing.

  It never hides a problem. Read state is per viewer, so another member still sees the child unread; `unread` remains nothing but `sessions.last_sequence > acknowledged_sequence`, so a child that emits one more event goes unread again on its own; and the `failed` and `requires_action` indicators come from `sessions.status`, rank above unread in the rail, and are untouched. The fence is monotone, so a human who already read further is never regressed.

  The one thing it does change is that an explicit mark-unread is **not** sticky against it. Because the fence is monotone and OpenGeni stores no durable "leave this unread" intent, marking a child unread, letting that child do more work and report again, and then letting the parent consume that notice acknowledges it once more. That follows from the premise that consumption is the read signal, and the mark still holds until the parent consumes a newer notice, but it is a real behaviour change for anyone using mark-unread as a personal to-do flag on a child of an active orchestrator. Making that intent sticky needs a durable explicit-unread marker, which this change deliberately does not add.

  The acknowledgment does not touch `attention_version`. That revision exists only to order explicit human attention mutations against each other, and this writer publishes no event, NATS invalidation, or sequence advance a browser could learn from, so bumping it would silently stale the version the rail holds and turn the human's next mark-read click into a 409.

  The write is one `parent_session_id`-fenced `INSERT ... SELECT ... ORDER BY id ... ON CONFLICT` per claim, so a payload field can never decide whose personal state is mutated, and rows lock in the same UUID order the other session writers use. It honours the `session-personal-state` advisory fence with `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock_shared` and skips the acknowledgment rather than blocking, because workspace membership removal takes that fence exclusively and _before_ the workspace/session lock prefix a claim already holds; the probe is shared because the rail list holds the shared counterpart for its whole transaction, and an exclusive probe would drop acknowledgments precisely while the human is watching the rail. It takes no child turn/attempt lock; `session_pins`'s two foreign keys to `sessions` do take `FOR KEY SHARE` on the child's row, which is compatible with the `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` every canonical session writer takes.

  Because a row can now appear between another `session_pins` writer's read and its write, `setSessionPin`, `setSessionAttention`, and `setSessionArchive` upsert instead of insert; the acknowledgment row is pin-neutral and archive-neutral, so their conflict path is the same transition as their insert.

- b74e557: Add an explicit, replay-safe Document authority-reclassification lifecycle and
  a resumable organization Default-collection backfill. Reclassification requires
  the exact expected authority tuple, updates the Document and every chunk in one
  transaction, and retains immutable before/after receipts. The SDK and API expose
  the account-admin and actor-fenced operations, bounded cursor-paginated receipt
  history, and same-organization portable-personal behavior without making
  collections an authority boundary.
- b2cd0f0: Slack can notify the human when work they started stops making progress, **off by default and switched on per workspace**. The new `slackOrchestrationNotices` workspace setting carries one boolean per notice (`childRequiresAction`, `goalPaused`), two checkboxes sit beside the reaction shortcut in the Slack integration settings, and `resolveWorkspaceSlackOrchestrationNoticeSettings` fails closed: absent, malformed, or partially invalid settings resolve to both disabled, so only an explicit opt-in ever posts. An unsolicited Slack post is worse than a missed one, and the in-app rail and priority feed already surface this work.

  When a workspace opts in, a Slack-originated session's `child_requires_action` notice becomes one bounded pointer card ("A worker you started needs input", a single-line first-question or waiting-approval preview, and an **Open in OpenGeni** link to the child session), and a goal that pauses for `limits` or `max_auto_continuations` becomes one bounded line. Deferred child lifecycle notices, `user_pause` / `api` / `agent` / `no_progress` pauses, and `goal.resumed` stay silent, and so does a blocked-worker notice whose exact `(child, turn, generation)` boundary already carries a resolution or whose own row is `superseded` or `cancelled` - Slack delivery runs behind the session, and a card announcing a worker that is no longer blocked is worse than no card. Both notices draw on the same durable per-interaction slot budget as assistant progress, so an orchestration that fans out to many blocked children cannot turn one thread into a feed; a slot is claimed only when a card is actually going to be posted.

  A disabled notice takes the same "nothing to post for this event" path as an undeliverable one - no post, no ledger row, and the delivery cursor advances identically - and every pre-existing Slack card type is unaffected. Both reuse the durable per-event post-operation ledger, so reaper retries and replica claims cannot double-post. Rolling migration `0329_slack_orchestration_delivery_events.sql` adds `system.update.pending` and `goal.paused` to the Slack delivery claim's event types, and `@opengeni/db` exports the read-only `getSessionSystemUpdateById` and `childRequiresActionResolutionExists` used to resolve the exact typed notice and prove it is still current.

- 1789977: Ask once where an unconfigured Slack conversation should work, remember the answer, and re-queue the request that was interrupted by the question. One live card per person per conversation is enforced by a partial unique index, an aged-out card is settled by the writer rather than holding the slot, and the answer commits the choice, the remembered route and the re-queued request together.
- 64d8d2c: Schema and resolvers for per-channel and per-DM Slack workspace routing. **Nothing reads any of this yet**: no route table is consulted, no new column is written, and single-workspace Slack behaviour is byte-identical.

  Rolling migration `0335_slack_workspace_routing.sql` adds four FORCE-RLS tables (`slack_channel_routes`, `slack_user_dm_routes`, `slack_route_prompts`, `slack_route_prompt_options`), five additive nullable routing columns plus a `route_state` CHECK on `slack_interaction_inbox`, a frozen `routed_workspace_label` on `slack_interactions`, and one narrow content-free `SECURITY DEFINER` probe, `opengeni_private.resolve_slack_interaction_tenancy`. The Slack installation binding is deliberately untouched: `resolve_slack_installation`, the active-team unique index, and the second-binding trigger are unchanged, so one team still installs into exactly one home workspace and one credential. Routing is a separate additive fact within the same organization, fenced by a `target_account_id = account_id` CHECK.

  Routing splits **home** tenancy (the installation's credential, identity link, inbox, App Home, reaction-summon settings, task policy, and every new table) from **target** tenancy (the interaction, its action handles, its progress deliveries, the grant, the session, and its events). There is no backfill: `route_state IS NULL` means "legacy / never routed" and is exactly today's behaviour, so an old API or worker image ignores the new tables and columns entirely.

  `@opengeni/db` gains the pure resolver library behind it: `probeSlackInteractionTenancy` (ids only, so thread continuation can cross workspaces on the connection-global route key), `getSlackChannelRoute` / `getSlackUserDmRoute` and their `upsert*` / `delete*` siblings (the ask-once memory), `listSlackRoutableWorkspacesForSubject` (the single implementation of "workspaces this subject may start work in", which unions permission-filtered memberships with the subject's own personal workspace), and `resolveSlackTargetAuthority` - the only place a Slack request may reach a managed human's personal workspace. `getWorkspaceGrant` is **not** widened, so no API-key or delegated-bearer principal gains personal-workspace access; the pointer path accepts only the subject's own `personalWorkspaceId` from an active same-organization membership and then re-checks live authority.

- ad6acbe: Add the bounded organization connection-authority convergence seam to the `@opengeni/db` public surface: `classifyOrganizationConnectionAuthority` and `backfillOrganizationConnectionAuthority`, plus their `ConnectionAuthorityClassificationReport` / `ConnectionAuthorityBackfillReport` types, and the durable `runKey` receipt option on the organization membership backfill drain.

  Connection owner authority now binds through one owner-only seam that works under the production database posture. `organization_memberships` and `organization_user_resource_authorities` are `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and OpenGeni runs its SECURITY DEFINER routines as a non-superuser owner without `BYPASSRLS`, so the previous inline `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` plus authority insert matched nothing: a new personal connection whose subject held a live organization membership silently degraded to the `legacy_user` lane, and the bounded `legacy_user` upgrader refused every deterministic candidate.

### Patch Changes

- 1b21135: Attach a selected user-owned Connected Machine atomically when creating a session from the managed web console, including recovery-stable `once` authority.
- 4d83368: Separate worker-claim queue state from prompts genuinely waiting behind work, keep rapid sends on stable chat and queue surfaces, and make local development fail fast when schema or aggregate runtime readiness is lost.
- fc80fdf: Split the Slack integration's single workspace identifier into two explicit scopes: home (the installation binding that owns the bot credential, the inbox row, the identity link, and the post ledgers) and target (the workspace that owns the interaction, its action handles, the grant, and the session). The two are equal today, so behaviour is unchanged. Thread continuation is now connection-scoped through the content-free tenancy probe, interaction creation adopts an existing thread's tenancy instead of failing an idempotency conflict, delivery builds its bot client from the installation route, and the first-task hint resolves its identity claim and its frozen answer in the scope that owns each.
- 4e48785: Fence both Slack routing tenancy probes on the organization the caller is acting for, and apply the canonical live-authority rule to the membership arm of `resolveSlackTargetAuthority`, so a suspended organization member holding a stale `workspace_memberships` row is no longer granted. The two arbitrary-subject Slack resolvers are renamed to the repository's `namedSubject*` convention and carry the oracle banner.
- e720d3e: Add a quiet "-> Workspace" line to Slack acknowledgements and deliveries when routing actually chose a workspace, and bump all five Slack post operation-id seeds to v2 in the same change so no interaction with a claimed-but-unposted delivery row can wedge on a digest that will never match again.
- 3e3b09a: Add per-channel and per-DM Slack workspace routing behind `OPENGENI_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ROUTING_ENABLED` (default off). Migration 0337 adds a private ids-only action-handle tenancy mapping so a routed button click can find its handle, and gives a shared-task origin its own tenancy pair for the frozen Slack task policy revision, which stays a home fact while the origin follows the routed task.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: Child lifecycle notices for parent sessions (rolling migration 0325 widens the `session_system_updates` / `session_system_update_outbox` kind checks and adds the `session_system_updates_pending_kind_source_idx` partial index). Behind the process-global flag installed by `configureChildLifecycleNotices`, the child's own lifecycle transactions enqueue one dedupe-keyed outbox row for the parent: `applySessionTurnSettlement` on a `requires_action` freeze (`child_requires_action`, bounded human-input previews plus approval ids) and on terminal cancellation of pending requests; `acceptSessionHumanInputResponse`, `acceptSessionApprovalDecision`, expiry, and subtree Cancel (`child_requires_action_resolved`); a direct `pause` in `mutateSessionControlInTransaction` (`child_paused`, never for a recursive ancestor pause or when the parent's own attempt issued it); `armCodexCapacityWait` / `armXaiCapacityWait` (`child_waiting_capacity`); `recordSessionGoalProgressWithEvent` (`child_progress`). Every producer takes the child-lifecycle lock prefix (the parent session row joins the UUID-ordered session lock) and the shared `parentOutboxAuthorityTx` authority resolution; the failed/idle terminal producers now route through the same `enqueueChildLifecycleNoticeOutboxTx` writer. `addSessionSystemUpdateWithSourceMutation` honors the kind's wake class (`deferred` kinds insert the pending row and event only, never wake or auto-resume a goal), applies producer-side supersession (a resolution supersedes the pending `child_requires_action` of the same exact child turn generation; a newer `child_progress` supersedes the older pending one) with a `system.update.cancelled` fact, and no child notice wakes a parent whose goal is not active. `materializeGoalContinuation` and `peekSessionWork` let only `immediate`-class pending input win against a current `goal_wait` hold. Outbox rows of every child-lifecycle kind are typed through `SessionSystemUpdateOutboxDelivery`.
  Hardening for unknown kinds (any image from here on): `claimPendingSessionSystemUpdateOutbox` dead-letters one unparseable outbox row (`status = failed`, bounded `last_error`) and keeps delivering the rest, and the claim path marks a pending `session_system_updates` row whose kind or payload it cannot parse `failed` with a visible `system.update.cancelled{reason:"unrecognized_kind"}` instead of throwing into an endless re-peek. A delivered `child_terminal_result` supersedes that child's still-pending `child_progress` / `child_waiting_capacity` notices (`superseded_by_terminal`; a pending `child_requires_action` is left to its exact resolution because terminal delivery is unordered against notice creation); `failSessionWorkBeforeAttemptClaim` resolves the child's cancelled human-input rows for the parent; interaction-intervention expiry records `respondedByKind: system` and the REST routes record `api` for key principals. With the flag off, the only behavioural change is the widened lock set (the parent session row `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`) on requires_action settlement, goal progress, and capacity-wait arms.
- de3f376: Bound and shape the durable text an agent authors on a user's behalf. The budget
  follows the destination, on every agent surface that reaches it. A mandatory
  workspace rule is composed verbatim into the prompt of every session it applies
  to, so `remember`, `instruction_policy_propose`, and `task_note_promote_instruction_policy`
  are all capped at 600 characters; the preference destination is capped at 1,200
  across its three surfaces, because only its short descriptor is composed and the
  content is retrieved on demand. Task-note promotion is checked in the database
  layer, where the content is the note rather than a request field, and is rejected
  rather than truncated before any evidence, claim, or proposal row is written.
  `company_profile_propose`, the largest always-on surface, is capped for agents at
  400 characters per scalar, 200 per list entry, and 4,096 UTF-8 bytes total. The
  Knowledge lane keeps its 4,000-character retrieval-evidence ceiling, and every
  human editor limit is unchanged so nothing a person already typed becomes
  invalid. Tool descriptions now state the prompt cost and the authoring shape, and
  the `remember` confirmation card names the character count and destination so a
  human can judge the cost before saving. Existing stored revisions are never
  rewritten.
- e6ffdc7: Input-aware goal continuation pacing. `auto_continuations` now counts only consecutive synthesized continuations that consumed no external input: the claim that binds a goal turn to a batch carrying any other machine input resets it, and the latest-finished-turn reset orders by finish time so a human prompt queued after internal turns restarts the streak. A `max_auto_continuations` pause is pacing rather than intent and auto-resumes in the same commit as new external input from every producer (child results, scheduled occurrences, media results, Agent messages, Agent Steer, human/API Send/Steer) with `goal.resumed{actor:"system", reason:"external_input"}`; `user_pause`/`api`/`agent`/`limits` pauses are never auto-resumed. A late child result or child message can therefore revive a cap-paused parent. "Newest finished turn" is ordered by finish time in the hold, evaluator, backoff, and projection, so a human turn finishing after a `goal_wait` turn retires the hold; a hold whose deadline just passed is due now and skips the backoff once. `materializeGoalContinuation` accepts an optional `idleBackoff` policy and returns `deferred` (armed `goal_idle_backoff` workflow-wake row at the pacing deadline, ledger untouched) between consecutive no-input continuations; the goal projection reports `backoff_pending` with `nextAttemptAt`. No migration.
- 0b3b8df: Add an explicit organization-owner-confirmed agent path for company-profile and
  strategic-goal administration. The two-step MCP flow stages an immutable inactive
  full-profile proposal, binds activation to the initiating human's exact
  structured confirmation, revalidates current organization authority and profile
  CAS in PostgreSQL under the canonical workspace/session lock order, and remains
  independent of workspace learning mode. The manual `account:admin` route keeps
  its admission contract, and the earlier proposal-only `company_profile_propose`
  tool (`durable_learning` provenance) is retired in favor of this path.
- bbd19e0: Add an owner/admin organization setting that enables Only-me chats in shared
  workspaces for organizations holding the session-tenancy readiness receipt
  (`GET`/`PATCH /v1/organizations/:organizationId/private-session-settings`,
  `@opengeni/sdk/organization-private-session-settings`, and the organization
  settings page). Already activated organizations are backfilled enabled.
- 8e2361b: Slack first-task onboarding hint, frozen per interaction (rolling migration 0327 adds the nullable `slack_bot_user_links.first_task_hint_interaction_id` and `slack_interactions.first_task_hint`; no defaults, no backfill, and both tables keep their FORCE-RLS workspace-isolation posture). `resolveSlackInteractionFirstTaskHint` decides once whether an interaction's acknowledgement renders the hint and writes that boolean to the interaction row in the same transaction that claims the per-identity slot, so at most one interaction per Slack identity per installation is granted it. Because `slack_bot_post_operations` binds one operation id to a request digest over the message text, and acknowledgements are re-rendered on repair, later calls replay the frozen boolean and reproduce identical bytes; unlinking and relinking the Slack identity cannot flip an acknowledgement that already rendered. Failure raises rather than degrading to "no hint". `SlackInteraction` gains `firstTaskHint` and `SlackBotUserLink` gains `firstTaskHintInteractionId`; neither `getOrCreateSlackInteraction` nor `saveSlackBotUserLink` can write them, and claiming does not bump the link row's `updated_at`.
- 5d664d8: Surface why a goal is not pursuing and how long children have waited for a human. `Session.treeStats` gains optional `attentionSince` (earliest `requires_action` entry among the counted attention descendants), `Session` gains optional `requiresActionSince` on list and lineage reads, and the goal continuation projection gains optional `holdReason` for a `held_for_input` hold. `SessionChrome`'s goal pill spells out the pause reason ("Paused · cap" / "budget" / "by you" / "agent"), explains an idle-backoff check time and an agent `goal_wait` hold, and exports `sessionChromeGoalPillLabel` / `sessionChromeGoalPillExplanation`.

### Patch Changes

- 1fc235b: Omit a human/API prompt whose turn was never claimed (still queued, or deleted/edited/cancelled before any claim) from `sessions_list` `includeLastMessage` previews and the MCP `session_events` monitoring read, so orchestrators do not mistake work the model never received for processed conversation. `queuedPromptCount` still reports waiting work, the exact stored row appears at its original sequence once the turn is claimed, and REST event pages, SSE, and forensic reads are unchanged. Rolling migration 0322 adds the partial index `session_turns_unclaimed_prompt_trigger_idx` (`workspace_id, session_id, trigger_event_id` where `started_at IS NULL`) that serves the unclaimed-turn probe.
- a9cd9e7: Add the default-off first-party GitHub REST MCP bridge with separate workspace-App and personal-OAuth actors, exact accepted-repository authority, reviewed read/write tools, connector-policy defaults for writes, Codemode parity, bounded credential-free results, and no replay after ambiguous mutations.
- acd38d1: Retire Browser and Desktop resources when their source task leaves the Connected Machine that owns their controller, stop retrying the terminal placement conflict, and let Desktop create one replacement on the task's current placement.
- 45bffc3: Return empty personal-resource authority pages before session-tenancy activation while keeping mutations and runtime use activation-gated. Allow managed humans to read their personal Rig catalog without granting Rig administration.

### Patch Changes

- b2dd2f7: Bound the remaining request-scoped workspace control-row mutations and make the lock budget a first-class setting: `updateWorkspaceSettings`, `deleteSessionTreeIfQuiescent`, queue move/edit/delete, composer draft save, and the MCP agent message accept an optional `controlLockTimeoutMs` that API routes and core commands pass (lifecycle callers keep the unbounded wait), so a busy workspace yields the same typed retryable 503 `WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`. `OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` is now parsed and validated once at boot by `@opengeni/config` (`workspaceControlLockTimeoutMs`, positive integer ms, default 20000), installed into `@opengeni/db` by `createApp` through `configureWorkspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs`, and rendered by the deployment runtime-env generator as an optional passthrough.
- ab81e47: Allow the managed staging Slack app and bot to use the visibly distinct `OpenGeni Staging` identity. The manifest, runtime configuration, installation verification, durable binding contract, SDK, web projection, and deployment artifacts now preserve one closed environment-qualified display-name setting while production continues to default to `OpenGeni`.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9530e19: Let a managed human use the session surface inside their own personal workspace, without widening the owner-only exception to anyone else.

  A managed human's personal workspace deliberately has no `workspace_memberships` row (migration 0219 raises on one) — their access is the `organization_memberships.personal_workspace_id` pointer. Three session seams fenced on a bare membership probe and therefore denied the one human who always belongs: `GET /v1/workspaces/:id/sessions` returned **403** so the workspace looked empty, `PUT …/sessions/:id/pin` returned **403**, and `PUT …/new-session-draft` returned **403**.

  `subjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthorityInScope` (`packages/db/src/workspace-authority.ts`) is now the single implementation of the corrected rule. It refuses to set `opengeni.subject_id`, which makes the arbitrary-subject oracle shape unrepresentable at these seams and keeps the authority read inside the caller's transaction and advisory fence.

  **The authorization is not that resolver.** Neither it nor the exported `namedSubjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority` establishes who the caller is — both answer "does subject X hold authority here". The one thing that authorizes the exception is `AccessGrantAuthorization.canonicalManagedHumanSession`, stamped only inside the branch of `resolveAccessContext` that verified a Better Auth cookie. Inspecting the grant would not do: a delegated bearer chooses its own `principalKind`, `metadata.delegated`, `serviceInitiator`, and `subjectId`. Bearer/delegated principals, API keys, service initiators, same-organization co-members, organization admins and owners, and account administrators all fail closed, as does any authentication path added later.

  The public helper is renamed `subjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority` → `namedSubjectHasLiveWorkspaceAuthority`, and it now restores `opengeni.subject_id` after probing (`withRlsContext` restores account/workspace but not subject, so the probed subject leaked out of the savepoint). This changeset declares the required `@opengeni/db` **major** at the first PR that lands the breaking rename; the companion connection-authority change retains its own `@opengeni/core` major for its separate public break.

- 6909443: Activate the database prerequisite for session visibility changes and independent private forks through a drained, forward-only per-organization receipt. The session-tenancy adapter now rejects non-quiescent mutations with a typed conflict, limits the first fork contract to same-workspace private destinations, and returns the exact durable event identity.

### Minor Changes

- 3e1ad07: Add turn-atomic personal Variable Set and Rig attachments for create, Send, and
  Steer, including logical-turn once receipts, recovery-safe snapshots, warning
  acknowledgement, and SDK contracts.
- dc8c73f: Add professional organization administration with canonical rename and a
  Personal-safe shared-workspace access inventory, explicit Organization /
  Workspace / Only-me scope at Rig and Variable Set creation, and activation-gated
  atomic private visibility when creating sessions.
- fbc760e: Add the first-party `goal_wait` MCP tool and a durable goal continuation hold.
  An orchestrator whose active goal depends on child sessions or an external
  event records a bounded hold (reason plus mandatory deadline, at most 7 days)
  with a `goal.held` timeline fact instead of busy-polling. The continuation
  materializer returns `held` while the declaring turn is still the latest
  finished turn and the deadline is ahead: it never consumes the goal wake
  revision and re-arms a delayed workflow wake at the deadline on every idle
  evaluation. Pending machine input wins with `queue`, and any newer finished
  turn, a passed deadline, or a human/API/agent goal mutation clears the hold.
  The goal projection reports a current hold as `blocked` / `held_for_input`
  with `nextAttemptAt` at the deadline (rolling migration 0317).
- f7497fd: Add a disabled-by-default, user-owned personal GitHub OAuth lifecycle with
  separate deployment credentials, signed PKCE state, encrypted token custody,
  verified GitHub identity, typed SDK routes, reconnect fencing, and idempotent
  disconnect.
- ff011e6: Add bounded owner-only personal GitHub repository discovery, immutable selected-repository
  authority storage, full-replacement and verification APIs, typed SDK methods, and exact
  accepted-turn/scheduled-task authority snapshots for explicitly bound repository resources.
  The dedicated `connectionType: "github_personal"` resource discriminator preserves existing
  host-opaque Git credential bindings without reclassifying them as personal OAuth authority.
  Runtime Git and GitHub API execution remain unavailable until their separately audited broker
  and provider-consumer phases land.
- 48b9f09: Allow organization administrators to invite an email before registration, bind
  the invitation only after exact Better Auth email verification, and apply its
  initial shared-workspace access when the invited user joins without creating a
  redundant fallback organization.

### Patch Changes

- e57ce11: Replace full session-id snapshots with bounded activity-fenced keyset pagination so workspaces with more than 5,000 sessions remain listable.
- 3825727: Normalize legacy or malformed workspace-membership permissions before member listing and authorization, without restoring any obsolete authority.
- 1cd0eb0: Omit Responses output-only item `status` when persisting conversation history, and omit opaque `encrypted_content` from the portable compaction temporary copy, so SuperGrok-origin portable sessions can continue and compact on Codex. Keep the Codex wire strip as defense for already-stored rows and mid-turn SDK items. Durable history is not rewritten on a model switch.
- ebb3669: Add the agent-facing `company_profile_propose` first-party MCP tool over a new `proposeCompanyProfile` seam: an exact agent attempt records one inactive organization company-profile proposal (durable-learning provenance, `agent-attempt:<attemptId>` source) that an organization account admin reviews and activates from Company Brain → Company profile & goals, which now lists pending proposals with their content.
- 492fb71: Allow foreground session readers to acknowledge an exact rendered event sequence so later unseen events remain unread.
- 66593eb: Reconcile and verify the session-list visibility predicate grant when a fresh
  deployment runs migrations before creating its restricted application role,
  and keep app-supplied composer controls shrinkable within a single footer row.
- cc2fa1b: Keep a live sandbox turn holder alive through a provider-deadline rotation: the resume-side holder-liveness loop releases only when the holder itself is gone or its attempt is superseded (`heartbeatLeaseHolderStatus` separates holder liveness from lease extension), the turn-side rotation checkpoint reinstates its exact lost holder at the same epoch/instance before the warm capture, mutation admission under a requested rotation reports `rotation_in_progress` instead of `lease_fenced` and starts that checkpoint, `write_stdin` to a retained PTY renders admission faults as the tool result instead of failing the turn, and `sandbox.box.terminated` carries the drain reason.
- e9ff652: Fix human-confirmed `remember_confirm` activation after the human-input resume
  (migration 0316): the human answer is bound to the same logical turn and exact
  proposal rather than one execution generation, so the answered request row and
  the live attempt may both carry a later generation of that turn than the
  decision receipt, for both governed-learning activation and knowledge-claim
  confirmation.
- fe54954: Add an authorized, quiescence-fenced API and SDK operation for permanently deleting a root session tree.
- ba0be3d: Add activation-gated owner management for personal-resource session and standing grants, with kind-derived actions and permissions, exact session authority epochs, route-workspace-fenced revocation, RFC3339 lifecycle timestamps, bounded keyset pages, complete credential-free delegation receipts, FORCE-RLS-safe expiry and invalid-action settlement, and SDK methods that intentionally exclude standalone `once` and custom expiry.
- d8ba09d: Make private children inherit their parent's visibility through an exact live-attempt capability, expose effective tool policy in session monitoring, keep late child results from restarting settled parents, and preserve private-owner authority on internal-update turns.
- 72736ef: Take the canonical turn/attempt lock prefix before retaining a screenshot, retry that idempotent prepare on deadlock, and keep leftover persistence failures from failing the tool.
- c7cafb1: Activate owner-only session visibility changes and same-workspace private forks
  through the public API and SDK after per-organization tenancy activation.

  Expose activation-gated session tenancy metadata, typed quiescence and
  idempotency conflicts, exact durable event fanout, and explicit retry fences.

- c83c590: Decide turn-startup SLO milestone receipts (queue, provider_dispatch, first_byte) through a per-turn ledger, `session_turn_startup_milestones` (migration 0318), instead of re-reading the turn's `session_events` rows on every inserted model-request event. Each append or settlement claims its checkpoints with one primary-key `insert ... on conflict do nothing returning`, so the cost is O(1) per model request and no longer grows with the turn inside the transaction that holds the workspace inference-control row; recovery and replay remain no-ops, the terminal failed first-byte outcome is fenced on ledger state, and a turn already in flight before the ledger is sealed once so it never re-observes a checkpoint.
- 3b6b30e: Make the workspace control prefix fair and bounded: `lockWorkspaceInferenceControl` takes a FIFO transaction advisory lock before the row lock so Pause/Resume cannot be starved by continuous shared claim/settlement/append traffic, Send/Steer/queued Steer/realtime sync hold the prefix shared while the target branch is active and escalate through a savepoint only for a paused branch, and request-scoped API mutations fail with a typed retryable `WorkspaceControlBusyError` (HTTP 503) instead of parking a pooled connection and snapshot when the prefix stays busy.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a70d94: Add the read-only organization tenancy parity checker (organization-tenancy phase E). Migration `0298_organization_tenancy_parity.sql` adds a strictly read-only `check_organization_tenancy_parity(uuid, integer, integer)` SECURITY DEFINER seam behind its own transaction-scoped, migration-owner-only capability (the 0254/0285 pattern; deliberately separate from 0285's capability so the inventory seam gains no visibility it was not reviewed for). `@opengeni/db` exports `checkOrganizationTenancyParity`, the pure `composeTenancyParityReport`, and the `TENANCY_PARITY_GATES` / `TENANCY_PARITY_LANES` / `TENANCY_PARITY_UNVERIFIABLE` catalogs; `bun run db:check-tenancy-parity --organization-id <uuid>` emits the machine-readable report and exits non-zero when a gate fails.

  Fifteen invariant gates cover organization/membership/workspace consistency, one membership-row-free personal workspace per active membership, stable authority uniqueness, provider-account collision propagation, session ownership provenance, zero partial delegations, and the shadow legacy-vs-proposed scope comparison. The seam never writes, repairs, or widens anything, and no reported mismatch is resolved toward user authority. Compatibility lanes are reported separately from invariants, and properties with no honest measurement (the shape-constrained variable-set/rig/machine "unclassified" counters, default session visibility, and total session ownerlessness) are reported as explicitly unverifiable rather than as counters that could never drain to zero.

  Every lane must have a reachable zero, or the cutover gate is structurally unreachable rather than merely unmet. The workspace-writer lanes are therefore bounded observation lanes (`workspaceWriterAdmissionsLegacyUnattributedInWindow`, `workspaceWriterProcessesLegacyUnattributedInWindow`) rather than drainable all-time counts: `sandbox_workspace_mutation_admissions` and `sandbox_retained_processes` are settled by `UPDATE` and never deleted, and 0277's one-shot attribution backfill only reached rows whose actor was a turn, so every pre-0277 `direct:` / `process:` admission keeps the `legacy_unattributed` sentinel permanently. `connectionsLegacyUser` is honestly labelled as drainable only _after_ the organization-membership backfill lands, because 0256 still actively mints `legacy_user` for new connections whose subject has no active membership. The checker requires a writable primary; a read replica fails with `25006`.

- 18474f1: Add the organization-tenancy phase D session ownership classification and backfill seam (migration 0297, rolling), plus `bun run db:backfill-session-ownership`.

  The slice was scoped on a false premise. Sessions are not 100% owner-NULL: migration 0225's `guard_session_authority_write` trigger already derives session ownership on every INSERT, and `session_visibility_isolation` is live. 0285's `sessions.ownerless` count is the residue of that trigger's two INSERT-only branches, not a migration backlog - and part of it grows with every API-key or scheduled session.

  Exactly two populations are deterministically repairable, and the backfill repairs only those: a session whose workspace is exactly one active membership's `personal_workspace_id` (a 1:1 anchor) and whose creator subject is that same membership - slice B deliberately provisions a personal workspace without a `workspace_memberships` row, so 0225's second branch cannot reach it - and the parent-inheritance closure that 0225's own first branch would have produced. Everything else is recorded unresolved with a fixed ledger reason code and never guessed: `service`-created sessions, non-`user:` subjects (`api_key:`/`configured:`) that 0219 and 0263 can never provision an organization anchor for, creators without a live membership, a personal-workspace anchor that disagrees with the creator, and - the largest refusal - an active human's session in an ordinary shared workspace, because replaying 0225's second branch retroactively would evaluate today's workspace grants against a historical session.

  The backfill is dry-run by default, bounded by `--limit`, resumable through `FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED`, and idempotent over session rows. Its candidate predicate carries the classifier's `created_by_subject_id LIKE 'user:%'` fence in its own SQL on both the dry-run count and the `--apply` claim, so the write path can never attribute a subject the classifier calls permanently unrepairable; the invariant is enforced here by construction rather than borrowed from 0219/0263. A `--run-key` ledger is deliberately not re-runnable: each batch opens its own receipt and the ledger refuses to re-open a settled one, so repeat with a new key. Ledger recording is one set-based statement rather than a row-at-a-time loop. It writes only the owner pair behind 0225's own visibility-write capability: no `visibility`, `authority_epoch`, or `updated_at` change, no session event, and no read widened - every candidate is `workspace_shared`, which `session_visibility_isolation` short-circuits on. Receipt recording is `to_regprocedure`-guarded against the tenancy backfill ledger and reports `ledgerAvailable` plainly.

  Both routines are `SECURITY DEFINER` capability-claiming seams rather than migration SQL for a structural reason: `sessions` is FORCE RLS, the documented deployment posture is a non-superuser migration principal without `BYPASSRLS`, and a plain migration-time `UPDATE sessions` therefore matches zero rows and reports success on such a deployment. The suite proves a non-zero attribution under a synthetic `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` owner.

- 093c17f: Add the tenancy backfill receipt and unresolved-row ledger (migration 0300, rolling). Phase D of the organization-tenancy program requires backfill to record receipts and unresolved rows without widening access, so both tables are FORCE RLS with no direct `opengeni_app` DML and are writable only through the `tenancy_backfill_ledger` lifecycle seam (`open_tenancy_backfill_receipt`, `record_tenancy_backfill_unresolved`, `complete_tenancy_backfill_receipt`). Every seam is tenant-fenced on the caller's exact `opengeni.account_id`, so one organization cannot open, append to, or settle another organization's receipt. Receipts are idempotent per organization/resource-family/run key, concurrently as well as serially; unresolved evidence is append-only and its count is owned by the append path rather than supplied at completion, so a sweep cannot understate its own outstanding obligations. The unresolved-row shape deliberately carries only a resource id and a fixed reason code - it records a refusal to infer authority and has no column able to express one.

### Patch Changes

- 3e60b2a: Repair the migration-time backfills that silently matched zero rows under a non-superuser table owner, and stop the class from recurring.

  `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` binds the table _owner_, not merely ordinary roles, and OpenGeni migrates as a non-superuser owner without `BYPASSRLS`. No tenant GUC is set during a migration, so a bare `UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`INSERT ... SELECT`/`DO $$` backfill over a workspace-scoped table matched **zero rows and reported success**. The hazard was invisible in CI because the test harness migrates as a superuser.

  Rolling migration `0296_force_rls_backfill_noop_repair.sql` repairs the three statements whose no-op neither aborted its own migration nor is recomputed at runtime: `connections.origin_workspace_id` (0256), `enrollments.origin_workspace_id` (0262), and the self-organization `organization_memberships.role = 'owner'` (0263). The first denied every workspace-owned connection at use time with `connection_identity_changed`; the third locked every pre-0263 organization out of its own membership administration. The repair is idempotent, is a no-op on a superuser-migrated database, and never infers authority from `created_by`, connection attribution, a default workspace, a resource name, or current access.

  New `bun run check:migration-rls-backfills` CI guard fails any future migration that backfills, or guards with `RAISE EXCEPTION` over, a FORCE-RLS table without opening the owner-only `NO FORCE` window. New `acquireOwnerMigratedTestDatabase` test helper drives `migrate()` through a `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` owner so this boundary is exercised for real. Full classification of every affected migration in `docs/force-rls-migration-backfills.md`.

- b230459: Replay an organization membership `accept`/`suspend`/`offboard` transaction a bounded number of times after a PostgreSQL deadlock abort. Replay is exact rather than approximate: the whole lifecycle command runs in one transaction keyed by its caller-supplied operation id plus its CAS revisions, and a deadlock abort rolls back every durable effect, so re-running the identical command either applies it once or observes the newer authoritative state. `updateOrganizationMember()` and `acceptOrganizationInvitation()` are wrapped because they are exactly the lifecycle commands that acquire workspace rows and can therefore be inside a cycle at all. `40001` is still surfaced unchanged as the authoritative stale-revision conflict.

  This is a caller-side safety net, not a lock-order fix: migration `0299_organization_membership_lock_order.sql` removes the organization/workspace lock-order inversion in SQL, and its parallel-load probe reads `pg_stat_database.deadlocks` directly so this replay cannot mask a regression. The `0263` lifecycle test correspondingly no longer assumes a particular deadlock victim - if the concurrent visibility transition is the one aborted it is replayed once, after which the committed offboard makes its `42501` denial deterministic.

- 8fa9820: Add the Phase D organization-membership and personal-workspace backfill driver (`bun run db:backfill-organization-memberships --organization-id <uuid> [--dry-run] [--limit N] [--max-passes N] [--after-subject-id <subject>]`). It provisions the membership anchor and deterministic personal workspace for humans who held workspace access before migration 0219 and never re-authenticated afterwards, through the exact existing `ensure_managed_human_personal_workspace` lifecycle seam - the Better Auth managed-access hook and the driver now share one `ensureManagedHumanPersonalWorkspace` implementation instead of two. Migration 0290 (rolling) adds only the read-only enumeration the driver was missing over the FORCE-RLS `organization_memberships` table; its new lifecycle marker is added to that table's policy `USING` clause only and can never authorize a write. Candidates are claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in independent transactions, so the command is idempotent, resumable, and safe to run repeatedly and concurrently; `--dry-run` writes nothing. `--limit` bounds one pass and a pass is a keyset window over the `subject_id` ordering of both populations, so a single invocation chains passes on the returned cursor until the organization is drained (`--max-passes`, default 1000, and `--after-subject-id` resume a stopped walk). That is what makes repeated runs converge on an organization with more than `--limit` subjects, and it is why the enumeration seam takes an exclusive cursor (`list_organization_memberships_without_personal_workspace(uuid, integer, text)`). Both populations page under `COLLATE "C"` and the driver merges them with the matching code-point comparator, so the keyset order is the same on both sides of the seam: under the database's locale-aware default collation the two orders disagree on mixed-case and underscored subject ids, and a cursor taken from the merge order would silently skip subjects while still reporting the organization drained. Anything lacking complete deterministic evidence (login identity, self-owned organization identity, owner-role workspace membership) is reported unresolved with a bounded reason code and left untouched.
- 323db7f: Correct the organization-membership lifecycle lock order. The three lifecycle entry points - `prepare_organization_membership_protocol_settlements`, the wrapped `organization_membership_command_0263`, and the `organization_membership_command` wrapper - locked `managed_accounts FOR UPDATE` and only then took the canonical `workspaces FOR KEY SHARE` prefix. Every ordinary workspace writer is forced into the opposite order (it holds its `workspaces` row and reaches `managed_accounts` through the account foreign-key check of the `sessions`/`session_events`/`session_turns`/`session_goals`/`session_system_updates` row it inserts), so suspending or offboarding a member concurrently with any workspace write in the same organization deadlocked with `40P01`.

  Migration `0299_organization_membership_lock_order.sql` replaces the organization row lock with a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed on the organization id - which preserves mutual exclusion between concurrent membership commands, is re-grantable across the nested entry points in one command transaction, and lives in a lock space no ordinary writer touches - and downgrades the row lock to `FOR KEY SHARE`, which still blocks DELETE and primary-key UPDATE of the organization while being compatible with every writer's FK check. CAS on `authorization_revision`, operation-receipt idempotency, and every fail-closed authorization check are unchanged; only lock strength and lock class moved. As a side effect the lifecycle no longer stalls every session/event/turn insert in the organization for the duration of a membership command.

- 4f9b2a9: Let a live agent read, message, and control peer workspace sessions instead of denying siblings and other roots.
- c19fad8: Visibility-isolate session list snapshots and pins. Migration 0225 installed `session_visibility_isolation` by enumerating relations with a foreign key to `sessions.id`, which reached 70 relations but could not reach `session_list_snapshots.ordinary_session_ids` — a bare `uuid[]` with no foreign key — so a cached list page kept naming a session for its whole TTL after that session transitioned to `user_private`. Migration 0301 strips the identity at the transition instead of filtering it on the read path: an `AFTER UPDATE OF visibility` trigger replaces the slot with the reserved all-zero UUID in every other subject's live snapshot, preserving snapshot cardinality and in-flight cursor offsets exactly, and writes those rows under migration 0225's existing owner-minted transaction-local write capability rather than assuming the migration owner is a superuser. The same migration fixes the opposite defect on `session_pins`, where the generic `FOR ALL` restrictive policy made a non-owner's stale pin both invisible and permanently undeletable by the member who created it: the USING side gains an explicit own-subject escape (PostgreSQL applies SELECT policies to a `DELETE` that reads a column, so a command-scoped exemption cannot work) while the WITH CHECK side keeps the strict predicate, so pinning an unseen session — and using INSERT as a session-existence oracle — stays denied. `transition_session_visibility` still has no product caller, so this is a correctness fix ahead of activation rather than a live exposure.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2cb04e0: Retire Memory V1's standing prompt block and its agent writes. `memoryPromptMode` is now always `retrieval_only`: no pinned/recency working set is injected into any agent prompt, and the `legacy_standing` rollback opt-out can no longer be selected. The `memory_save` and `memory_correct` first-party tools are removed; durable agent writes go through `remember` (explicit user-directed) and task-note promotion (the agent's own findings), while `memory_search` remains so an agent can still read what a workspace knows.

  Nothing is rewritten or deleted: `knowledge_memories` rows, human REST/UI audit, search, correction, export, and the Memory Slack publication path are unchanged. A workspace that stored `legacy_standing` keeps the stored value in its passthrough settings bag, where it simply stops meaning anything, and already accepted turns keep the mode they recorded because those snapshots are immutable facts about what was composed. Migration 0295 changes no data; it reports whether anything was still relying on the mode rather than assuming it was unused.

### Minor Changes

- 1c78ed0: Separate new-session and established-session composer policy authority. Exact draft submission now atomically freezes queued-turn text, resources, model, reasoning, and latency, then rotates the server draft; queue Edit restores that exact snapshot and stale revisions surface as conflicts instead of silent rebases.
- 79ee99b: Preference descriptors now carry `activationAuthority` (`human_confirmed` | `automatic` | `null`) alongside `provenance.trust`. Trust stays the frozen creation-time fact - a revision an agent proposed reads `untrusted_proposal` forever, and both activation adapters still require that value - while the new field answers the separate question of whether a human explicitly confirmed the activation or policy activated it automatically, read from the governed-learning activation receipt at descriptor-build time. Descriptors built before this field existed parse as `null`, which keeps their immutable stored JSON and pinned descriptor hash valid.
- 368ee6c: Add the explicit resource-classification assertion seam for Variable Sets, Rigs, and Connected Machines (migration 0291, rolling; organization-tenancy phase D slices 4-5), plus `bun run db:verify-resource-classification`. These three families need no data rewrite and none is performed: `authority_scope` is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'workspace'` on all three tables and every `*_authority_shape_check` was `VALIDATE`d at creation, so a legacy unmigrated row and a deliberately workspace-scoped row are byte-identical and there is no discriminator to classify on. `connections` (0256) is the one sibling family with a genuine one (`subject_id` plus an active organization membership); none of these tables has it, and phase D forbids substituting `created_by`, connection attribution, a default workspace, a resource name, or current access.

  The seam therefore asserts and receipts instead. It proves per row what no constraint enforces - that a row claiming user ownership points at an authority of the matching `resource_kind`/`resource_id`, that the authority and its owning organization membership are both live, and that the delegation still has an origin workspace - and records every failure as an unresolved obligation with a fixed reason code through the tenancy backfill ledger, never as a guess or a rewrite. Its report states `ledgerAvailable` plainly so a run that could not record its obligations is visible rather than silent.

  It is a `SECURITY DEFINER` capability-claiming seam rather than migration SQL for a structural reason: all three tables are FORCE RLS behind `workspace_rls_visible`, which is false while the workspace GUC is unset, and the documented deployment posture is a non-superuser migration principal without `BYPASSRLS`. A plain migration-time `UPDATE` on these tables matches zero rows and reports success on such a deployment, and only appears to work in a harness that migrates as superuser.

### Patch Changes

- 5dc88ef: Terminalize attached Chrome Browser/Computer sessions when the device connection generation changes, stop Reconnect from retrying the stale placement, and physically stop ScreenCaptureKit helpers so replayd cannot accumulate.
- f4afa19: Resume requires_action only from the open suffix plus paired history. Pause stores the sentinel instead of a leftover SDK RunState heap.
- d581eef: Allow a connected Chrome profile to move from a revoked machine enrollment to its replacement enrollment.
- a7df809: Harden the four `remember` instruction-policy edges.

  A moved policy head is now one typed, actionable `RememberError` (`baseline_stale`) on both the propose and confirm sides instead of an untyped error or a raw SQLSTATE 40001. The activation baseline no longer contributes to operation identity, so an ordinary turn-recovery replay of the same `operationId` stays idempotent across a head change; staleness is still enforced by the compare-and-set and by the activation function. A governed write that fails now archives the evidence task note it created instead of stranding it.

  A confirmation stranded by a head that moved after the human already answered now rebaselines onto the current head and completes, instead of hard-failing and forcing the human to answer again. Proposal uniqueness moves from one-per-source to one-per-source-per-baseline to admit that successor; the successor reuses the same knowledge proposal, so the human's confirmation stays bound to exactly the content they approved.

  Two consequences worth stating plainly:

  - Activating a rule replaces the whole active policy document, so confirming a second rule discards a first rule that a human also approved, without asking again. That is the existing whole-document-replacement design of this lane rather than something the rebaseline introduces - previously the stale baseline forced a round trip that would have clobbered anyway - and the audit trail stays exact, with the activation event naming the revision it replaced and `undo` restoring it. The rebaseline removes the round trip, which makes the behaviour easier to reach.
  - Excluding the baseline from operation identity changes both the proposal request fingerprint and the governed-write input hash (which derives the service actor subject id). A `remember` operation that durably wrote rows under the previous release and is replayed under this one computes a different identity and fails as an operation-reuse conflict. This is bounded to operations in flight across the deploy and self-heals with a fresh operation id; no dual-identity compatibility path was added.

- 8583779: Resume `requires_action` from paired history plus a bounded open suffix instead of materializing an oversized SDK RunState blob.
- a99ef33: Test-only: add cross-organization isolation and revocation evidence coverage for the organization-tenancy authority tables. `packages/db/test/organization-isolation-evidence.test.ts` proves, against a real PostgreSQL instance, that a member of one organization cannot read or mutate another organization's workspaces, sessions, or resources, and that revoking a membership takes effect immediately for the exact revoked grant. No shipped runtime behavior changes; this releases the new coverage with the package.
- 7bc1cd1: Correct the organization tenancy inventory seam (migration 0292, rolling): remove the untruthful `unclassified` counters for Variable Sets, Rigs, and Connected Machines. 0285 defined them as `authority_id IS NULL`, but the authority shape constraints _require_ a NULL `authority_id` for every organization- and workspace-scoped row, so the counter was structurally `total - userScoped` - every correctly classified row was reported as unmigrated and the number could never drain to zero as the documented backfill gate. No corrected predicate exists: `authority_scope` defaults to `'workspace'`, and `origin_workspace_id` means "predates the scoped lifecycle" for Variable Sets, is still produced NULL today by `createRig`'s non-scoped branch for Rigs, and has inverted polarity for Connected Machines (0262 backfilled it while the ordinary enroll path leaves it NULL). The population is unrepresentable in the current schema, so the key is removed rather than renamed - `byScope` already reports every authority distinction the schema can truthfully make. `schemaVersion` moves 1 -> 2; the seam stays read-only, integers-only, and exact-organization scoped, and `CREATE OR REPLACE` preserves its owner and `opengeni_app` EXECUTE grant. The documents gate is unchanged: its `authority_kind = 'personal' AND authority_id IS NULL` names a genuine invariant violation and remains truthful.
- 6d22ab5: Widen the task-note expiry ceiling from 30 to 90 days. Task notes are pure agent-to-agent coordination within one root session tree; resuming a paused root session/task tree after a longer gap previously lost all coordination notes silently. `TASK_NOTE_MAX_LIFETIME_DAYS` is now the single source of truth, referenced by the application-layer bound checks and `remember`'s evidence note instead of a hardcoded literal. Fully backward compatible: every existing row and every caller supplying 1-30 days keeps working unchanged.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a03b86f: Read-only organization tenancy inventory (migration 0285, rolling): `bun run db:inventory-tenancy --organization-id <uuid>` reports content-free counts of every legacy-attribution population the tenancy backfill/parity program gates on - ownerless sessions, unclassified variable sets/rigs/machines, connections per authority lane, membership anchors, unattributed workspace writers, and the linked-input document/Codex gates. Integers only; the SECURITY DEFINER seam validates the exact organization context and returns no identities, keys, or values.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6937eaf: The API-direct session-attach variable-set materialization lane (viewer attach and direct channel operations cold-creating a box) now records the accepted subject and a `variable_set.materialized` audit fact with the live session authority tuple (migration 0282, rolling; unchanged function signature). Attribution flows through the standard request-context GUCs; an old image that sets no subject records the explicit `service:session` sentinel. Denials keep their fail-closed raise-and-rollback semantics.
- b05130a: Hard-cut editable spreadsheets to authored-only canonical state, deterministic formula projections, and explicit current compatibility protocols. Preserve React compatibility with artifact-tool 0.1 and 0.2 while adding the 0.3 line.

### Patch Changes

- f804057: Remove the arbitrary per-turn Codemode call cap. One turn may journal as many Codemode calls as the work needs; recovery still reuses that same journal rather than minting a new budget.
- 418b531: Human-confirmed Knowledge approvals now record truthful review reasons: migration 0284 adds a reason-carrying overload of `governed_learning_apply_knowledge_review`, and both human-confirmed callers (`confirm_remember_knowledge_claim` and `activate_human_confirmed_learning_decision`) pass an explicit human-confirmed reason instead of the hard-coded "Automatic governed-learning activation." wording; the 9-arg signature keeps that legacy wording for the automatic path and remains the guard-resolved capability writer.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c2d958: Google Drive publication freezes its exact output destination on the accepted delegation, so a later connection-settings change fails an already-accepted turn's publication closed instead of silently redirecting it. Every publication sits behind exactly one durable execute-once connector fence (the attempt connector-action wrapper for model callers, the tool's own registration for Codemode callers): a failure before the first mutating provider request settles not_executed with a retry-safe message, while a failure after it settles uncertain and surfaces the unknown outcome.
- 4c2d958: Scoped stream tokens (`ogs_`, 120 s TTL unchanged) now carry the authenticated viewer subject and the session's live authority epoch (migration 0281). The viewer lease holder records the same pair monotonically, the API re-verifies a human viewer's current workspace membership at every mint and degrades the stream to `transport:null` when membership is gone, and the selfhosted relay fences an attach whose authority claim is below the channel's recorded floor. Pre-0281 tokens keep working during the rolling window and enforce nothing new.

### Patch Changes

- 4c2d958: `remember` with `lane: instruction_policy` no longer fails after a governed-learning rule activation: the onboarding-proposal insert now copies the head's `activated_at` baseline in SQL instead of round-tripping it through a millisecond JS `Date`, so the draft trigger's exact comparison holds against the microsecond `clock_timestamp()` value the governed-learning controller writes.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a65505d: Connection-use audit facts record the frozen causal initiator and session authority epoch/visibility/owner of every authorized or denied use, and variable-set materialization/secret-read audit events carry the causal human, attempt authority triple, and owner authority identity (migration 0280). Variable-set authority denials are now recorded as metadata-only audit facts from a fresh transaction while the fail-closed rejection is preserved.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ca75ed9: Add the governed-learning activation controller with exact authority revalidation, destination-native workspace activation, immutable content-free receipts, and supersession-safe append-only undo.
- c297fc0: Add permission-first Company Brain guidance, Knowledge, proposal, and content-free accepted-turn context inspection surfaces.
- 02e21fa: Accept an optional curated `category` on registry capability catalog imports instead of forcing every imported connector into the registry-wide default.
- c297fc0: Route derived Company Brain proposals through the immutable workspace learning-policy snapshot before destination admission.
  Add exact rooted Task-note to proposed workspace Knowledge promotion with immutable value-free provenance and replay-safe MCP tools.
  Add atomic Task-note correction/revert with immutable old/new lineage, strict attempt/version fencing, and replay-safe first-party tooling.
- db758f3: Publish governed-learning activations and undos to the configured workspace Slack channel through the existing durable publication outbox. The dead durable-learning adapter (`publishDurableLearningOutcomeToSlack`) is replaced by `publishGovernedLearningEventToSlack`, which projects only content-free receipt facts, uses `governed-learning:<event>:<receiptId>` idempotency, and fails closed for Slack-derived evidence.
- e9aabaa: Wire the governed-learning evaluator and activation controller into the Company Brain learning-policy router. Ways-of-working proposals now record a content-free decision receipt after they commit; under `automatic`, an eligible preference decision is activated through the destination lifecycle (instruction policy keeps a human activation boundary). The route receipt gains `learning`, `learningFailure`, and activation receipt/destination facts; `activation.activated` is no longer always `false`.
- c297fc0: Add atomic rooted Task-note promotion into inactive instruction-policy and
  preference proposals while preserving exact source evidence, replay identity,
  and human-only activation.
- 22c0c21: Add the managed-human organization invitation, role, suspension, offboarding,
  and retention lifecycle with revision-fenced APIs and SDK methods. Self
  invitation history is exposed only through bounded keyset pages, and acceptance
  resolves one exact subject-bound invitation. Already-open session,
  workspace-control, live, and interaction streams periodically recheck current
  membership authority and close after revocation. A bounded operator command
  commits expired offboarded personal database deletion together with a closed,
  exact-key cleanup-obligation set before deleting external objects. Provider
  failures retry only unfinished obligations, retained references abort before
  external bytes are touched, File bucket identity stays frozen across retries,
  and immutable lifecycle evidence survives cleanup.
- 4eb7abd: `remember` with `lane: knowledge` now returns `confirmation_required` bound to the Knowledge claim, and `remember_confirm` (`claimId`) approves the claim through the Knowledge review lifecycle after the exact initiating human answered the bound canonical question with `save` (rolling migration 0274, `confirm_remember_knowledge_claim`, immutable `remember_knowledge_confirmation_receipts`). `remember_confirm` accepts either `proposalId` + `decisionReceiptId` (preference / instruction policy) or `claimId` (knowledge); the confirm receipt carries `claimId` and a `knowledge` activation summary with `undo: knowledge_review`.
- 89d4ab3: Add the explicit user-directed `remember` / `remember_confirm` agent tools. Content becomes exact task-note evidence promoted through the learning-policy router; a preference activates immediately under `automatic`, Knowledge stays proposal-only, and everything else returns a bound `request_human_input` payload whose `save` answer authorizes activation through the new rolling migration 0272 `activate_human_confirmed_learning_decision` capability (`authority_kind = human_confirmed`, human-input request id recorded on the receipt).
- 304462e: Workspace-membership removal is now one fenced SECURITY DEFINER teardown (migration 0278): the removed member's queued/live turns in that workspace are cancelled, live attempts interrupted, realtime modes ended, private-session authority epochs advanced, workflow wakes registered, and per-workspace personal rows plus the membership deleted in one transaction. Self-removal, last-admin removal, and non-administering actors fail closed in the database seam.
- 16cbd7b: Make `retrieval_only` the default Company Brain memory prompt mode. An absent or unrecognized workspace `memoryPromptMode` now removes the broad Memory V1 standing block, excludes legacy preference-kind rows from agent search, and omits the company profile from child prompts; an explicit `legacy_standing` remains the per-workspace rollback opt-out. Rolling migration 0271 applies the same fallback at turn acceptance so frozen snapshots and the contracts resolver agree.
- 30ba620: Make every accepted scheduled agent occurrence an immutable, credential-free
  execution snapshot bound to one run, session, scheduled update, logical turn,
  and attempt chain. Agent tasks accept explicit `connectionAuthorities`
  (omitted preserves, `[]` clears, an array replaces), execution-affecting edits
  require the same causal human, `once` grants are consumed exactly once per
  run, cold reusable sessions converge on one revision-bound materialization
  receipt, and task deletion becomes a one-way paused tombstone with durable
  connector cleanup. Create/update requests are byte-bounded at ingress while
  stored rows stay readable. Migration `0275` is a maintenance cutover.
- f72563d: Slack now has exactly two authorities: the personal hosted Slack MCP grant and the OpenGeni workspace bot. The workspace-owned hosted Slack MCP connection is removed: OAuth start, reconnect, the callback fence, and capability enablement reject an explicit non-personal ownership for `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`, an omitted ownership on that resource defaults to personal, and `listEnabledMcpCapabilityServers` no longer runs a workspace-scoped Slack MCP installation enabled by an earlier release. The bot manifest and canonical bot allowlist gain the bot-token Real-time Search scopes `search:read.public`, `search:read.files`, and `search:read.users` as requested-but-not-required extras; apply them to the Slack app before deploying, since the install URL requests every requested scope. The bot search tool itself is a separate change.
- c297fc0: Add deterministic governed-learning evaluation over exact accepted policy and evidence authority, with immutable content-free decision receipts and no activation capability.
- ea52ff2: Workspace-owned connections no longer bypass the accepted connection-use authority: resolve_accepted_connection_use gains a workspace lane (migration 0279) that revalidates the exact live workspace-owned connection inside the canonical lifecycle fences and records the same idempotent audit facts as personal delegations, and the worker routes workspace-scope MCP credential resolution and per-provider-request authorization through it. Only a pre-snapshot ref with no connection id keeps the bounded unprivileged legacy resolution.
- cac85bc: Every persistable /workspace writer admission and retained process now freezes its exact authority tuple (causal initiator, initiating human, organization-membership grant identity with observed revision, and session tenancy epoch/visibility/owner). Direct and process actors are fenced like turns: a revoked or suspended grant, or an unattributed pre-0277 tenancy half, fails a new mutation closed before any workspace generation is consumed, and the running provider process is never terminated or re-owned.

### Patch Changes

- 91d5caf: Add a provider-neutral operational instruction contract for consistent agent collaboration, execution safety, file editing, and skill usage across every OpenGeni persona. Keep persistent system instructions prompt-cache stable, project goal continuations once as canonical user messages, let authoritative human input supersede a pending continuation, and remove the unreliable inferred-progress pause.
- c297fc0: Add the permission-filtered Company Brain read and deterministic OKF export
  surface, subject-scoped full guidance history, and the Company Brain discovery
  and export experience.
- 987742d: Reduce turn-start overhead without reducing admitted history, rig variables, or
  user-visible content. Active history loads in one admitted query, automatic
  compaction skips duplicate history work below threshold, unchanged Codex
  credential pointers avoid redundant session-activity writes, rig defaults
  load at bounded concurrency for admitted worker attempts, and the attempt-scoped
  MCP wrapper no longer reuses a broader process-global tool list.

  Improve large-session interaction by measuring rich-message disclosure without
  a second React commit, showing truthful pending queue actions immediately, and
  replacing the false zero-step placeholder with the session's real lifecycle.

- 6a8954f: The `remember` and `memory_search` tool descriptions now state where saved facts actually live: a confirmed `lane: knowledge` fact enters the human-reviewed Knowledge claim lifecycle (not workspace memory), and indexed workspace documents are searched with `knowledge_search`/`knowledge_get` on the separate Document Search (docs) MCP server rather than through workspace `memory_search`.
- 5cd7b46: `remember` with `lane: instruction_policy` now binds the draft to the target's current activation baseline (active head revision and CAS version, including a deactivated-to-null boundary) instead of assuming an empty workspace, so a user-directed rule can be proposed and confirmed in a workspace that already has an active policy.
- d168b8f: Allow exact scheduled service turns to materialize organization- and workspace-scoped Variable Sets while preserving causal-human and personal-grant checks for user-scoped sets.
- 6860c5f: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private scopes for Rigs and Connected Machines. Personal machine use and Rig materialization now revalidate exact-attempt grants, membership, workspace access, authority epochs, and generations before runtime access.
- c297fc0: Freeze Company Brain mode and bounded legacy instructions when a turn is
  accepted, then bind them to a content-free first-attempt selection receipt whose
  candidate and rendered-budget subsets make replacement recovery shrink-only.
- c297fc0: Complete governed goal rewrites with strict agent change metadata, immutable
  proposal rejection and CAS-fenced rollback, bounded revision pagination, and
  accepted-turn root constraints that child agents may inherit or narrow. The
  original raw-array goal-revision list remains unchanged; bounded pagination is
  available through a separately named API and SDK surface.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- a551666: Fix local Gmail provider OAuth callbacks, Google scope equivalence, stable
  Discovery compilation, and installed API integration visibility in session
  tool selection.
- 90c0c3e: Persist bounded, content-free Company Brain prompt contribution estimates on authoritative model-call facts and expose their source breakdown and coverage in Workspace Insights.
- e0e0102: Unify browser, computer, identity, realtime, and Codemode behavior across managed sandboxes and connected machines.
- 4d1ed07: Preserve complete bounded lazy-search tool schemas across durable model history, expose Linux desktop application launch when the image supports it, suppress the managed Chrome sandbox warning, label Computer sessions as Desktops in the UI, and keep AnyDoc available in headed desktop sandboxes.
- ce3b370: Restore the MPL-2.0 license and notice for the curated HashiCorp Terraform Skills in the published runtime package, and forward-repair the persisted Terraform Stacks provenance URL.
- b2af2df: Bind Integration facet idempotency receipts to the subject that created them so another workspace administrator cannot replay a personal facet result.
- e9e1016: Allow agent `goal_set` to replace completed goals while continuing to protect
  active and paused goal intent.
- ffbbf4c: Add organization, workspace, and owner-private Variable Set scopes with independent metadata, plaintext-read, write, attachment, and runtime-use authority. Runtime secret materialization now revalidates the exact live attempt and personal grant immediately before ciphertext egress while audits remain value-free.
- 3843825: Prevent workspace administrators from rebinding another subject's personal API Integration instance.
- 1ab8023: Deduplicate scheduled alert deliveries onto one atomic responder session per scheduled task and canonical alert occurrence while preserving separate roots for distinct tasks and reopened occurrences.
- 886682d: Fail closed when a persisted Terraform Stacks Pack component resolves to an unrelated, inactive, cross-tenant, or digest-mismatched Plugin installation.
- 234a5e7: Replay exact completed Integration facet configure receipts before mutable instance, Connection, or provider validation while preserving request conflicts and exact-subject isolation.
- d2f172c: Add fail-closed, metadata-only capability, exact rig-version health, exact alert-selector data-source checks, and source/claim authority fencing for scheduled incident telemetry responders before expensive retrieval.
- 04b1a1f: Add exact-attempt, workspace-local governed Knowledge proposal/correction
  routing and inactive instruction-policy and preference proposal adapters while
  preserving human activation authority and immutable Knowledge provenance.
- c056063: Project exact Integration Facet ownership so shared or externally managed bindings are read-only and direct removal reports retained owners truthfully.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 083387e: Replace the removed per-turn `turnInstructions` system-prefix contract with generic per-message `modelContext` content. This is a breaking release-train cutover: old mutating clients are rejected after migration 0240. Context now enters canonical user history without standard timeline rendering, preserves the persistent prompt-cache prefix, and works across initial, queued, steer, realtime delegation, and transcript handoff paths.

### Patch Changes

## 0.36.1

### Patch Changes

- 499c70c: Retry transient pre-inference attempt claims atomically, durably re-wake a
  logical turn when its activity failed before creating an attempt, and preserve
  the requested backoff deadline once older workflow-wake revisions are delivered.
  Still-open legacy workflow histories and every effectively active durable work
  shape whose prior wake was delivered now retain the same recovery obligation:
  queued/recovering turns, accepted approval responses, released capacity waits,
  manual compaction, and pending internal updates. Held, paused, live-attempt, and
  already-pending wake states remain untouched.
  Terminal failure retries also close the workflow without synthesizing an
  active-goal continuation.

### Minor Changes

- 478d7fe: Add explicit, bounded root-task-tree coordination note tools with exact-attempt authority, private-session visibility, expiry, immutable create/archive receipts, and safe retry semantics.
- 478d7fe: Persist exact accepted-turn goal authority, separate semantic goal revisions
  from execution progress, and add policy-controlled rewrite proposals with API,
  SDK, MCP, and runtime support.

### Patch Changes

- d86610d: Show elapsed UTC-hour buckets for the Insights Today range while retaining UTC-day buckets for longer ranges.
- 478d7fe: Add a reversible workspace memory prompt mode that removes the legacy standing memory block, keeps preference observations out of agent behavioral authority, contains company-profile context for child agents, and reports metadata-only model-context contribution telemetry.

### Minor Changes

- 8beed26: Add workspace-governed Slack shared-conversation task policies with durable enforcement and public contracts, and enforce vertical-only agent session authority across core and persistence.
- 8beed26: Add managed-human organization membership discovery. Expose the exact active
  self-membership and personal-workspace identity returned by the existing
  narrow provisioning capability through a managed-session-only API route and
  typed SDK method, while denying delegated/API-key principals and terminal
  memberships.
- 8beed26: Activate server-authoritative session visibility and content forking. Add user-private session ownership, authority-epoch transitions, explicit cross-workspace fork operations, session-scoped RLS actor propagation, and API authorization that preserves workspace-shared access while enforcing private-session ownership.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e78f58: Replace provider presets and nullable integration identities with immutable Integration Definitions. Curated and workspace-authored integrations now share one definition-based contract, provenance model, OAuth callback, SDK route, runtime projection, and maintenance migration with no legacy API alias or fallback authority.
- 1e78f58: Make Facet definitions and bindings authoritative throughout the Integration domain. Public routes, SDK methods, Pack components, owner identities, physical tables, persisted manifests, and runtime projections now use one Facet vocabulary with a maintenance cutover and no compatibility aliases.
- 746bbbe: Add canonical human identities with multiple verified login bindings, revisioned and audited lifecycle operations, immediate session invalidation, fail-closed recovery and collision handling, and metadata-minimal managed identity API routes.
- 9849e25: Add strict identifier-free xAI provider-account authority snapshots and durable
  SuperGrok/xAI multi-account persistence with live user authority revalidation,
  encrypted credential boundaries, fair exact-turn leases, pool-scoped pins,
  quota/cooldown metadata, capacity waiters, immutable accepted-work snapshots,
  FORCE RLS, and explicit runtime privilege posture.
- 1e78f58: Make normalized Plugin, Version, Skill Facet, and component-owner records authoritative for curated and imported Skills. Add reviewed library install, list, update, preview, and uninstall contracts; preserve Pack and Plugin ownership independently; and retire every non-MCP row from the generic capability catalog and installation ledger through a collision-free maintenance migration.

### Patch Changes

- 1c4ac69: Preserve complete MCP tool results through the runtime, durable database settlement, and worker recovery path without changing model-visible output, including nested prefixed servers, compact approval snapshots, and bounded live-memory retention after durable capture.

### Minor Changes

- d2def0c: Add the complete browser-native and semantic computer interaction system across managed sandboxes, Connected Machines, attached Chrome, and external browser placements. Ship durable browser identities, authentication repair, network routing, downloads/uploads, shared causal control, public SDK and React workbench surfaces, and one exact MCP/Codemode execution catalog with native Connected Machine access.
- d241d13: Add the managed-human organization-membership and personal-workspace lifecycle
  provisioning capability while preserving legacy workspace access behavior.
- 733c22f: Add the organization-tenancy foundation contracts and inert database scaffolding for organization memberships, user-owned resource authority and grants, personal retention, and generic session visibility, fork provenance, and authority epochs.

### Patch Changes

- d15d3e8: Repair the Slack reaction-task experience with initial-only session links, disabled link/media unfurls, workspace-service-principal delivery, conservative terminal-output coalescing, direct execution of safe specified requests, and bounded deterministic import of exact reacted-message PNG/JPEG/WebP attachments as reference-only workspace files. Preserve fail-closed provider-outcome reconciliation and keep generic model-facing posting unavailable without a trusted durable logical-delivery identity.
- 3f81608: Stage and validate the session-channel foreign key without retaining the column-addition lock across a populated sessions-table scan.

### Minor Changes

- aeb07f4: Add durable workspace decision publication to verified Slack bot channels with immutable configuration revisions, outbox attempts and receipts, bounded retries and terminal states, admin review/history UX, typed SDK methods, and a post-persistence governed-learning outcome adapter.

### Patch Changes

- 87e9ae6: Add durable Google Drive Changes cursors, Shared Drive-aware delta draining,
  bounded full reconciliation, cursor-invalid repair, and a default-off
  Workspace Events wake seam. Normalize My Drive's root alias before ancestry
  checks and preserve cumulative item, provider-request, and elapsed budgets
  across delta, continuation, and full-repair checkpoints. Carry bounded
  per-object revision floors across delta-to-full and checkpointed full scans so
  older or equal Drive revisions cannot regress accepted metadata/current-version
  state, fail closed on conflicting fallback identities, and keep the first
  observation in one scan generation as a durable monotonic floor. Fence item
  version/metadata writes plus checkpoint and terminal cursor settlement to the
  exact lease, initiating subject, scan, checkpoint generation, and accepted
  floor, so a lost full-page checkpoint cannot replay version 8 as version 7.
- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.

### Minor Changes

- b46f4de: Add a compact, cursor-paginated agent-topology read surface with root, direct-child, and search filters for lazy hierarchy browsers.
- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.
- dcfe6eb: Add canonical attempt-scoped CodeMode, browser and computer interaction, and durable collaborative editable artifacts. Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.
- 31666e2: Add immutable workspace learning-policy revisions, lifecycle-only activation and rollback, accepted-attempt snapshots, and deterministic effective-mode resolution for `off`, `suggest`, and `automatic`.
- a858835: Add unambiguous Slack installation bindings and a token-free, subject-bound workspace access-request lifecycle for signed Slack identity links.

### Patch Changes

- 7954468: Recognize threaded Slack mentions delivered as message events, include bounded invocation context, and avoid duplicate final replies or repeated session links.
- bd5514e: Add explicitly enabled provider-neutral knowledge-source schedules with durable wake provenance, generation-fenced execution checkpoints and index obligations, fail-closed ACL activation seams, no-agent execution, layered pause state, shared schedule administration, and Google Drive source lifecycle integration.
- 90eea29: Make connected-machine removal show every dependent session and support an explicit canonical move-to-default-sandbox confirmation before revocation. Default moves prove managed sandbox readiness through the existing fleet route, active turns remain fail-closed, and typed swap rejections surface as visible errors instead of false success.
- 5fcad0a: Expose an agent-safe checkpointed listing of newly indexed documents with source and provenance metadata.

  usage instead of retaining an older response's count.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 6eb0b23: Add production resumable composer transcription with exact-subject durable
  manifests, idempotent SHA-256 chunk uploads, bounded ffmpeg segmentation, one
  recording-wide provider pin, persisted retryable segment results, deterministic
  assembly, cross-browser SDK recovery, object-ledger cleanup, and expiry purging
  of transcript metadata after every provider object is confirmed deleted. Legacy
  one-shot voice input remains compatible.

### Patch Changes

- 49c7f9c: Prevent deadlocks between sandbox mutation settlement and retained-process promotion, retry idempotent settlement transactions after transient database conflicts, and clarify that an idle session sandbox can be restored when the next operation needs it.

- Updated dependencies [c9d8b69]
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.38.1
  - @opengeni/config@0.10.11

## 0.27.4

### Patch Changes

- b6e39fc: Polish session chrome and apply_patch rendering; clarify realtime voice-end handoff.

  SessionChrome gets denser selected-chip UX and Codex function-tool apply_patch shapes render in the specialized diff UI. Solo goal_continuation machine-input rows are suppressed in favor of the GoalRow landmark. The realtime transcript-tail instruction now keeps in-flight work going after voice ends.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 13b961e: Add an atomic terminal session-subtree cancellation command that drains queued work, fences concurrent prompts and child creation, interrupts live attempts, durably reports cancelled children to surviving parents, and exposes the operation through the API/core/SDK control surface.
- e03397d: Freeze workspace instruction policies and structured preference descriptors at
  the accepted logical-turn boundary, add immutable per-session policy roles, and
  compose the resulting exact-attempt governance into agent and compaction prompts.

  S256, Reddit permanent grant) with encrypted token storage and just-in-time
  refresh, live first-party MCP tools (search, mentions, thread fetch, own-post

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- f413e6c: Add real Workspace Insights: durable `model_call_facts` after authoritative
  `agent.model.usage`, a `workspace:admin` insights API over usage_events + facts +
  live joins, SDK client, and a web console that drops mock rollups for honest
  UTC credit/token/cache/warm/caps reporting.

### Patch Changes

  sandbox migration history, while accepting only the exact legacy staging
  receipt for an idempotent replay.

- 42428a2: Add per-session Codex remote compaction v2 (`remote_v2` / `portable`), with UI landmarks, Codex-only model locking, and opaque token accounting aligned to Codex CLI.
- 7b65614: Keep over-limit viewer-only sandboxes drained until a fresh serialized balance
  or monthly-cap evaluation clears a durable workspace admission gate. Viewer
  reattach can no longer re-arm a draining box or spawn a cold successor, while a
  turn-held sandbox remains viewable.

## 0.15.5

### Patch Changes

- b7df541: Prevent provider-native checkpoint capture from racing sandbox operations while
  the provider has paused the source box. Capture now owns a durable
  lease/epoch/instance/generation claim, blocks new holders and mutations, drains
  provider-local reads before entering the exclusive snapshot call, and retains
  ownership through late provider settlement and exact stale-claim recovery.
  Modal's typed completed-exec stdin race is also normalized into a side-effect-free
  terminal poll, so an exec that exits between local lookup and the provider write
  settles its retained process instead of failing the enclosing turn.

- Updated dependencies [b7df541]
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.24.3
  - @opengeni/config@0.7.19

## 0.15.4

### Patch Changes

- 84fb671: Prevent a ready file restored during reconnect from being counted twice across the durable composer draft and the still-live attachment card. Canonical duplicate refs are removed before draft persistence and composer submission while custom mounts and exact draft revision/content conflict protection remain intact.
- Updated dependencies [96eb64b]
  - @opengeni/config@0.7.18
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.24.2

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- 510eae3: Keep restored Modal checkpoints valid across live workspace writes, serialize
  lease reaping with concurrent acquisition, and rotate image or rig changes
  through durable checkpoint capture instead of discarding provider ownership.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- ddff8db: Add the read-only Workspace State inventory with bounded, authorization-scoped
  Documents aggregates and a deterministic metadata-only Memory projection. The
  projection explicitly labels legacy `knowledge_memories` preference-kind counts
  as non-authoritative observations while preserving the structured preference
  registry as the sole active preference authority.

- Updated dependencies [6d167f4]
  - @opengeni/codex@0.2.8
  - @opengeni/config@0.7.16

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f6f13f: Add the isolated, versioned organization/workspace/user preference registry,
  including audited proposal and activation flows, deterministic attempt-bound
  descriptors, authorized full-content retrieval, REST/MCP tools, and SDK types.
  Attempt reads revalidate current generation and immutable-human authority in one
  locked transaction; lifecycle writes use scope-version CAS and database-owned
  audit functions that prevent direct head mutation or history erasure. Snapshot
  creation is database-canonical and lifecycle governance requires a signed
  `human_session` principal; expiry filtering and supersession are transactionally
  enforced before bounds or terminal mutation.

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

- de20184: Redact known runtime credentials and recognized authorization, cookie, signed

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [55c6559]
  - @opengeni/config@0.7.1

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

## 0.10.7

### Patch Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

- 524599e: Normalize model, provider, upstream deployment, credential source, billing,

  logical turns.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- eed3438: Preserve private per-turn instructions when queue-edited prompts are resubmitted.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 1f0ed18: Restore immutable concurrent-index migration history, stage populated-table migrations safely, and reject goal-bearing child sessions whose resulting first-party authority lacks `goals:manage`.
- 00e1cdc: Enforce explicit session-event lock contracts and preserve sanitized PostgreSQL failure classification without replaying external effects.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 32011f1: Add an optional durable host event and usage export for embedded deployments: source-transactional bounded snapshots, immutable turn attribution and session-root lineage, named at-least-once checkpoints, multi-replica leases, replay and retention controls, explicit poison-record disposition, an isolated exporter database role, and a worker delivery pump. Standalone deployments keep capture disabled until a host registers a sink.
- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- 1f9305b: Add a host-owned session authorization port for embedded deployments. The port
  receives server-resolved root lineage and live agent-attempt authority, scopes
  session listing inside database queries, distinguishes exact from whole-tree
  projection access, gates HTTP/core/first-party MCP/Toolspace surfaces, and
  periodically reauthorizes idle SSE streams while standalone deployments retain
  their existing behavior when the port is unset.
- 8c66185: Let agent-created child sessions inherit omitted repository, MCP tool, and
  per-session MCP server context from their trusted immediate parent. Explicit
  arrays remain authoritative, mixed Git providers and multiple bindings are
  preserved, and credential headers are copied only as encrypted ciphertext.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Minor Changes

- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- 77d65f9: Use one canonical lock order for session-event persistence and retry only idempotent database transactions after deadlock or serialization failures, including generic event appends and operation-keyed Agent commands.
- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

### Patch Changes

- 28290a0: Make context compaction and pending tool-call recovery converge without reactivating superseded history or repeating failed internal turns.

## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 14ce2e3: Bound model-facing textual tool output with Codex-compatible, replay-idempotent semantics, account
  for complete current model input, make compaction failure/progress transitions
  durable and convergent, and replace recursive session discovery with a compact
  paginated projection.
- 053c5df: The codex rotation strategy picker is gone: rotation-enabled always behaves as sticky-sharded (sharded-rotation policy). Sessions stick to one subscription each for maximum prompt-cache reuse, spread across all connected accounts, rebalancing only when a plan caps. The legacy strategies (most-remaining, round-robin, drain-then-next) are all strictly dominated post-cache-affinity and are now normalized to sharded at every worker read site; their branch code is kept but unreachable (rollback safety). The API accepts-but-ignores `rotationStrategy` writes (deprecated no-op, no caller breaks) and reports `sharded` as the effective truth; migration 0064 backfills stored legacy values and flips the column default. The web settings surface drops the strategy dropdown for honest copy. Remaining user controls are the real intents: rotation on/off, manual per-session pins, and (with account eligibility policy) per-account allocator include/exclude.
- ec0697a: Ship the production-hardened captured workspace workbench, physically verified Steer/Pause cancellation across cloud, local, and self-hosted model tools, pre-model preparation, sandbox provisioning, and lifecycle/setup commands, durable quiescence admission fencing, cancellation-aware SDK reads and turn cleanup, single-round-trip pruned workspace indexing, truthful shutdown states, a responsive and accessible review dock, Unicode coverage, and package-safe CSS/SSR integration.

- ea52b39: Recover retryable provider failures as new fenced attempts of the same accepted turn, independent of goal state, while preserving durable tool history and pause controls.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a0cb58f: Streaming exec to Connected Machines over the op-stream protocol (server half).
  When a runner advertises the `op_stream` capability (persisted from its connect
  Hello onto the enrollment) and `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_STREAM_ENABLED` is on
  (default off), selfhosted exec streams as sequenced, acked, credit-flowed
  frames: no reply-size wall (retention-bounded, typed on overflow), blip-proof
  collection (re-attach + replay, blake3-verified byte-exact), and idempotent
  starts keyed by a durable per-tool-call op id so a re-dispatched turn attaches
  to the already-running command instead of re-running it. The legacy monolithic
  exec remains the permanent fallback wire form. The events bus gains an
  op-stream subscribe/publish accessor on the same managed NATS connection.

### Patch Changes

- 332ac15: Add workspace-scoped operator session-revival admission helpers and pending-work guards for safe control-plane recovery tooling.
- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 477b2bb: Add a "sharded" codex rotation strategy: session-sharded account affinity. Each session is assigned a deterministic HOME account (`hash(sessionId) % healthy-accounts`) at its first codex turn, written as a `policy` pin (a new `sessions.codex_pin_source` discriminator distinguishes it from a user's `manual` pin). A session stays on its one home account for prompt-cache warmth while load spreads ~1/N across the pool.

  Both rotation guards (proactive turn-start and reactive 429) now allow a `policy`-pinned session to rebalance when its account caps — never a `manual` pin, which stays sacred. A rebalance durably REWRITES the session pin (re-sharding over the healthy survivors so capped-account cohorts spread instead of re-concentrating on one failover) rather than moving only the workspace active pointer, because credential selection returns a pinned account with no exhaustion check.

  Pin lifecycle: a `manual` pin is honored under every strategy; a `policy` pin is meaningful only while the sharded policy is active. When a workspace runs a non-sharded strategy (or rotation is disabled), a leftover policy pin is ignored and lazily cleared on the session's next turn — so the session converges to the active strategy instead of idling on a capped ex-home. The strategy is selectable alongside `most_remaining`/`round_robin`/`drain_then_next` via the existing rotation-settings API; unpinned behavior under the other strategies is unchanged.

- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 13d0889: Allow independent sessions to persist attempt-fenced work concurrently while preserving an exclusive workspace Pause boundary, and align the durable control constraint with workspace Pause.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 4a25bfc: Connected Machines read OFFLINE immediately on a clean going-offline. When a machine announces a typed GoingOffline (user-stop / self-update / host-shutdown) it now records a nullable `went_offline_at` + `went_offline_reason` marker on its enrollment, and the liveness derivation gives an un-cleared marker precedence over last_seen aging AND over a lingering liveness probe — so the dashboard and any work-routing decision see the machine as offline right away instead of waiting out the dead-detect window. A lifecycle `revoked` status still trumps the marker, and any newer liveness signal (a reconnect Hello or a fresher heartbeat) clears it back to null. Adds the `setEnrollmentWentOffline` and `clearEnrollmentWentOffline` DB helpers, threads the marker onto `EnrollmentRecord` and the `selfhostedLiveness` input, and clears it inside `touchEnrollmentLastSeen`.
- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.
- 810542f: Commit workspace capture announcements atomically with their revision rows and keep harmless late capture bookkeeping out of the user timeline.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1e7a243]
  - @opengeni/config@0.4.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

  - @opengeni/contracts@0.9.0
  - @opengeni/config@0.3.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

### Patch Changes

- db468cc: Repair embedded-schema database migrations by re-granting `opengeni_app` table and sequence privileges in the active schema and setting schema-scoped default privileges for future objects.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

### Minor Changes

- 2170732: Publish the full Stage C `@opengeni/*` runtime closure to npm so external hosts can consume OpenGeni from published packages instead of vendored workspace tarballs.

  The release pipeline now builds every publishable package, rewrites every published `workspace:*` dependency to a concrete semver range, rewrites source entry points to dist entry points for every publishable package, and leaves only leaf-only non-runtime packages ignored.
