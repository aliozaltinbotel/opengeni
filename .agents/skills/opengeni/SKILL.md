# OpenGeni

This skill is for repo-maintainer agents working in, operating, or changing the OpenGeni repository.

## Overview

Use this skill as an orientation layer, not as frozen API documentation. OpenGeni evolves through the codebase, so code wins over this skill whenever they differ.

OpenGeni is a workspace-scoped agent control plane. Public clients talk to an API. The API resolves every protected request to an access grant, persists sessions and events, accepts user/control events, exposes replay/SSE streams, handles uploads, and talks to Temporal. A worker runs OpenAI Agents SDK turns inside a configured sandbox backend. Postgres is durable state, NATS is live fanout, object storage holds uploaded file bytes, Temporal coordinates work and schedules, and MCP servers provide pluggable tools.

Canonical source repo: `https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni`. This skill may be installed outside that repo, which is normal. If the current workspace is not OpenGeni, first determine whether the user wants client integration against a deployed OpenGeni service, source-level changes, deployment help, or conceptual explanation. For source-level exactness, inspect or fetch the repo; for client integration, ask for or infer the deployed API base URL and inspect the running API/client config where possible.

## Start With Repository Discovery

Always inspect the current repo before making claims or changes. Use fast searches and prefer contracts/types/routes over README prose when exact behavior matters.

Useful first pass:

```bash
rg --files -g '!*node_modules*' -g '!*.lockb'
rg -n "app\\.(get|post|patch|delete|all)\\(|/v1/|SessionEvent|ResourceRef|ToolRef|SandboxBackend|workflow|activity|OPENGENI_|mcp|schedule|upload|objectStorage|NATS|Temporal" \
  -g '!*node_modules*' -g '!*.lockb'
```

Then open the smallest source files that answer the question:

- API routes: `apps/api/src/routes/`, plus `apps/api/src/app.ts` and `apps/api/src/index.ts`.
- Core domain/access/billing helpers: `packages/core/src/` (`access/`, `domain/`, `billing/`, and `dependencies.ts`). These moved out of `apps/api`; API routes are HTTP adapters over `@opengeni/core`.
- Public shapes: `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, especially workspace, access, billing, usage, session, file, document, schedule, and MCP contracts.
- External host identities and credential authority: `packages/core/src/access/`,
  `packages/contracts/src/external-identities.ts`, and `packages/db/src/connection-authority.ts`.
  Verified external owning-user authority is distinct from a managed login cookie.
  Integrating backends provision ordinary native connections under `asUser`;
  interactive and backend setup share ownership and refresh machinery.
  Accepted turns/tasks capture exact named-user connection selection; execution
  and physical requests recheck live authority. Shared turns cannot borrow a
  creator's credentials. Preserve captured initiatingHumanSubjectId for schedules
  and child work, independently of request-time service administration.
  Host-specific registry, callback and selection APIs are retired; do not restore
  them as a parallel framework. Historical tables are not executable authority.
  The request-time gateway uses native connections with live caller checks, not
  fabricated sessions. See `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for cutover status.
- Config/env: `packages/config/src/index.ts`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Run lifecycle / goals / memory: `docs/run-lifecycle.md`, `docs/goals.md`, plus `apps/worker/src/workflows/session.ts` and `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/`.
- Feature subsystems: `docs/variable-sets.md` (scoped organization/workspace/user secrets), `docs/capabilities.md` (Plugins, Skills, and the MCP catalog), and `docs/automations.md` (authenticated event sources, immutable triggers, logical runs, and ordinary-session dispatch).
- Feedback: `docs/feedback.md`, `apps/api/src/routes/feedback.ts`, and `packages/db/src/feedback.ts` own authenticated general comments and session/turn ratings, separate from agent context.
- Database/state: `packages/db/src/schema.ts`, `packages/db/src/index.ts`, `packages/db/drizzle/`.
- Event bus/SSE: `packages/events/src/index.ts`, `apps/api/src/http/sse.ts`.
- Worker/orchestration: `apps/worker/src/workflows/`, `apps/worker/src/activities/`. Physical finalization after execution has a five-minute per-stage containment deadline on normal and cancelled exits; `agent-turn/finalization-monitor.ts` owns the bounded stage heartbeat/metrics. This is never a limit on agent execution. Closed-attempt writers still gate successors; adopted background commands retain their independent lifetime.
- Startup telemetry: `apps/worker/src/observability-metrics.ts` separates blocking
  preparation from background MCP work. Phase durations can overlap; use durable
  milestones for elapsed startup latency. Runtime stream initialization is not
  the provider wire-dispatch milestone. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md`.
- Runtime/sandbox/tools: `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` is the public agent-loop facade;
  retained Modal command observation uses the versioned task-router byte-offset
  boundary in `sandbox/providers/modal-command-control.ts`; output and cursor
  capture is atomic in `packages/db/src/retained-provider-commands.ts`. Never
  reinterpret a legacy batch locator or infer exit from missing output.
  `skill-catalog.ts` renders Skill descriptors into the turn-attempt instruction
  layer; the worker's `skill-read.ts` exposes eager text reads and `skill-checkout.ts`
  exposes on-demand filesystem copies. Repository Skill discovery is independent.
  `packages/runtime/src/model-provider.ts` is the package-private model-provider facade over
  cohesive client, error, request-policy, routing, and transport leaves beside it;
  `packages/runtime/src/model-input.ts` owns final model-wire shaping and context guards;
  `packages/runtime/src/run-events.ts` owns SDK stream/usage/interruption normalization.
- Files/object storage: `apps/api/src/routes/files.ts`, `packages/storage/src/index.ts`.
- Deployment/operator sources: `packages/deployment`, `docs/deployment.md`, `deploy/helm/opengeni`, `deploy/terraform/`, and `deploy/stacks/`.
- Knowledge, selective source retention, collection/duplicate discovery (`knowledge_prepare_save`), retrieval and learning policy: read `docs/knowledge.md`, then `apps/api/src/routes/knowledge.ts`, `packages/core/src/domain/knowledge*.ts`, and `packages/db/src/knowledge-entries.ts`. Old Memory and reviewed-Knowledge authoring are retired; conversation history and temporary task notes remain separate.
- GitHub integration: `apps/api/src/routes/github.ts`, shared workspace filtering in `apps/api/src/github-access.ts`, `packages/github/src/index.ts`, and the binding/allowlist helpers plus tables in `packages/db/src/index.ts` / `schema.ts`. The separately configured OpenGeni Lens GitHub App reuses the same owner-proof primitives through `apps/api/src/routes/pr-review-github.ts`; its shared webhook still enters the generic PR-review automation source.
- Connected Machine (bring-your-own-compute / the `selfhosted` backend): API routes `apps/api/src/routes/machines.ts` and `apps/api/src/routes/enrollments.ts`; services `apps/api/src/sandbox/machines.ts` and `apps/api/src/sandbox/enrollment.ts`; the machine-primary turn branch in `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/sandbox-establish.ts` and the clone-guard in `packages/runtime/src/index.ts`; the runtime session at `packages/runtime/src/sandbox/selfhosted/`; the on-machine agent + relay in the `agent/` Rust crate; public behavior in `docs/connected-machines.md`; opt-in UI at the `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath.
- Web usage examples: `apps/web/src/api.ts`, `apps/web/src/types.ts`, relevant UI components.
- TypeScript SDK: `packages/sdk/src/` (typed client, SSE streaming core with reconnect/replay-by-sequence, proxy re-streaming helpers) and `packages/sdk/README.md`.
- React hooks + styled components: `packages/react/src/` (hooks on the SDK, timeline projection, ChatComposer/MessageTimeline/SessionStatus/FleetTile, CSS-variable design tokens in `packages/react/styles/`) and `packages/react/README.md`; runnable harness under `packages/react/demo/`.
- Standalone product integration: `docs/product-integration.md` is canonical for
  organization API keys, organization workspaces, Personal-workspace exclusion,
  external tenant mapping, and external Skill ownership.

If paths have moved, find concepts by symbol name, not by old paths:

```bash
rg -n "CreateSessionRequest|ClientSessionEvent|sessionWorkflow|runAgentTurn|createSandboxClient|buildManifest|createObjectStorage|build.*McpServer|getSettings"
```

## Client Integration

For external clients, SaaS integrations, SDK wrappers, customer-side coding agents, or UIs on top of OpenGeni, prefer the separate `opengeni-client` skill when available. For TypeScript clients, `@opengeni/sdk` (`packages/sdk`) is the first-party client: typed session/event API, the SSE streaming core (reconnect + replay-by-sequence + dedup), and proxy-through-your-own-API re-streaming helpers. When staying inside this source-level skill, read `references/client-integration.md`. Treat OpenGeni as a service boundary: the client discovers or chooses a workspace, creates sessions under `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/...`, streams/replays events, sends follow-up/control events, uploads files, selects resources/tools, and displays approvals/status. Do not require the client to know worker, Temporal, NATS, or sandbox internals except as concepts for status and product behavior.

For the canonical external-product shape, the product backend holds an
organization API key and calls `ensureWorkspace` /
`PUT /v1/workspaces/external` for a stable product-tenant mapping. Call the
result an organization workspace; its wire kind is `"shared"`. Personal
workspaces are excluded. The external backend stores and versions product
Skills and passes selected definitions inline in `CreateSessionRequest.skills`
for each product-created session. Do not document or implement an
organization-wide Skill registry or Skill inheritance for this boundary. See
`docs/product-integration.md`.

## Access, Workspaces, Billing

Keep these boundaries explicit:

- Workspace scoping is core. Public operational routes use `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/...`; scoped Variable Sets are selected through that boundary but may be organization-, workspace-, or organization-user-owned.
- External product backends use an **organization API key**. Organization key
  administration uses `/v1/organizations/:organizationId/api-keys`; the key is
  server-held and cannot reach Personal workspaces through organization
  provisioning.
- An external product tenant maps to an **organization workspace**. The wire
  kind is `"shared"`; Personal workspaces (`"personal"`) are excluded from
  `ensureWorkspace` and must not be selected through a default-workspace
  fallback.
- Old unscoped operational routes are deleted, not soft-deprecated. Do not add compatibility aliases unless the user explicitly changes that product decision.
- Better Auth is only the managed-mode browser human auth resolver. It is not the tenant model and should not appear in core session/file/document/schedule route code.
- Managed sign-in method changes belong to `apps/api/src/routes/managed-sign-in-methods.ts`
  and its canonical identity/database guards. Discover the current contract in
  `packages/contracts/src/managed-sign-in-methods.ts` and the rollout in
  `docs/browser-login-session-sets.md`. Preserve verified-email linking,
  explicit-disconnect suppression, expected-human/revision fences, recent
  authentication, and last-usable-method protection across every login route;
  do not expose raw provider mutation routes or use `trustedProviders` to bypass
  email verification. Login methods are distinct from integration permissions.
- OpenGeni organization API keys are owned by OpenGeni and use the
  `Authorization` header. The optional deployment shared key uses
  `x-opengeni-access-key`.
- Billing, Stripe, prepaid credits, entitlements, usage, and limits belong in billing/access modules. Core route/domain code should check local providers/interfaces, not call Stripe directly.
- Product access mode (`local`, `configured`, `managed`) is separate from deployment/infrastructure profile (`azure-managed`, existing services, local Kubernetes, previews, and so on).
- RLS is defense-in-depth. Do not claim RLS-backed isolation from app-level checks alone; verify policies with a non-owner DB role and current workspace/account settings.

## Mental Model

Keep these concepts straight while working:

- **Account**: managed billing/ownership container for members, workspaces, credits, and billing mirrors.
- **Workspace**: operational data boundary for sessions, events, files, documents, schedules, GitHub installation bindings, usage, and first-party MCP.
- **GitHub installation binding**: a workspace-local reference to a GitHub App installation plus its repository allowlist. One GitHub installation may be linked to many OpenGeni workspaces; unlinking one workspace must not mutate another workspace or uninstall the App from GitHub. New binding is currently fail-closed: setup callback parameters are spoofable, and user-installation visibility, repository administrator permission, and an installation request do not prove that the current human may install or configure the App for the target account. Existing trusted bindings are rechecked before platform token mint / GitHub-authenticated run startup. Connected Machines are exempt because they use their own git auth.
- **Access grant**: resolved subject plus permissions for one workspace. Route code should depend on grants and permissions, not on the caller's auth mechanism.
- **Session**: durable user-facing work container. It owns status, resources, selected tools, model/sandbox settings, event cursor, and active turn. Normal idle closes without a grace timer after durable rechecks and transactional parent-result settlement; late input can start another workflow run of the same session. Keep the legacy timer replay patch and unrelated lifecycle waits intact; see `docs/run-lifecycle.md`.
- **Turn**: one queued/running unit of agent work inside a session, run as one non-retryable Temporal activity (`runAgentTurn`). Follow-ups, goal continuations, and scheduled task firings become turns. Inside a turn the SDK makes as many model/tool calls as the work needs; run length is bounded by symptoms (no-progress, budget), not by counts or clocks. A graceful worker shutdown preempts an in-flight turn (checkpoint, requeue, resume on a healthy worker) instead of failing the session. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md`.
- **Sandbox rotation wait**: a recovering turn fenced by an active managed-sandbox rotation parks on its exact sandbox group and lease epoch. Every authoritative rotation-ending or epoch-advancing transaction durably wakes that waiter; the workflow does not repeatedly reserve turn-worker slots while the same transition remains pending.
- **Goal**: optional durable per-session objective that flips "stop" into an explicit act — while active, the session workflow synthesizes continuation turns until the agent calls `goal_complete`/`goal_pause` or a user interrupts. The mechanism behind long-running autonomous runs. See `docs/goals.md`.
  Continuation is generated input, not new authority: resume established work
  against the current applied turn-frozen objective. Reuse only relevant,
  still-valid authoritative evidence; retain requested comprehensive audits and
  the full completion audit. Distinguish recoverable failures, definitive human
  blockers, and work in flight without fixed retry quotas or preliminary wait
  rituals. `docs/goals.md` owns the guidance scenarios; these instructions do not
  change runtime wake timing, child-result selection, or approval authority.
- **Admission block**: a non-transient preclaim persistence rejection parks accepted work without failing or consuming it. Inspect `sessions.admission_block`, the worker classifier and `docs/run-lifecycle.md`; authorized Resume or new Send/Steer explicitly rechecks, never grants missing authority. Operational DB failures retain timed recovery.
- **Control observation**: unavailable scoped reads are not deletion or idle truth; exact still-owned attempts are not successor admission. Versioned observers wait on signals/bounded control timers, retain outbox obligations, and inspect exact Temporal identity without replacing physical-writer proof. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md` before changing these paths.
- **Session memory (three stores, three jobs)**: `session_history_items` is exact accepted conversation truth fed to the model (default read path); `agent_run_states` is the serialized RunState blob, used only to resume a turn paused for a human approval; `session_events` is the exact append-only human-audit timeline for accepted payloads and is never fed back to the model. Protocol/size projections are deterministic and must not classify or rewrite content. Sandbox recovery state lives separately in `sandbox_session_envelopes`. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md`.
- **Variable Set**: named organization-, workspace-, or organization-user-owned collection of authenticated-encrypted secret env vars, attached to a session/scheduled-task and injected into the sandbox at run time. Attachment and runtime use require independent `variable-sets:attach` and `variable-sets:use` authority; exact plaintext access is a separate explicit permissioned operation with metadata-only audit. Never expose values through unrelated list/detail projections. See `docs/variable-sets.md`.
- **Event log**: append-only session timeline with per-session sequence numbers. It supports replay, SSE reconnect, UI timeline projection, and auditing.
- **SSE/NATS split**: Postgres is replay/source of truth. NATS is live fanout. If live events are missed, API should backfill from Postgres by sequence.
- **Temporal**: orchestration, signals, timers, schedules, and worker dispatch. Token streams/tool output should not be pushed through workflow history unless the code intentionally changes that design.
- **Worker activity**: side-effect boundary where the OpenAI Agents SDK actually runs. Treat model/tool/sandbox/cloud calls as side-effectful.
- **Sandbox**: pluggable execution environment behind the OpenAI Agents SDK sandbox interface. OpenGeni should describe the contract and selected backend, not pretend the backend is hard-coded. The shipped `SandboxBackend` enum is broad (currently twelve members), so never claim it is only Docker/Modal/local/none.
- **Connected Machine**: a user's own machine (enrolled through the `agent/` Rust agent) that acts as a first-class *primary* compute target, co-equal with the managed cloud sandbox — a sibling compute target, not a backend overlay bolted onto Modal. Its enum value is `selfhosted`. A machine-targeted turn establishes a `SelfhostedSession` directly and does NOT create, lease, or bill a cloud (Modal) box; the platform mints no GitHub token for it and never clones repos onto it (the machine uses its own git auth and already owns its filesystem). Runs execute at a per-session `workingDir` (default = the agent's launch dir), not a fixed `/workspace`. The whole feature is gated by `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_ENABLED` (default off). See `docs/connected-machines.md` and `references/sandbox-configuration.md`.
- **Resources**: external context mounted or made available to a run, commonly repositories and uploaded files.
- **Tools**: currently MCP-first. Tool refs select configured MCP servers. Built-ins are defaults, not limits.
- **Object storage**: stores uploaded bytes. Database stores metadata/object keys. Sandbox file access is normally via manifest/mount/injection based on current runtime code.
- **Scheduled task**: persisted schedule plus agent config that dispatches one or more session turns through Temporal scheduling.
- **Automation**: an authenticated external event accepted by a source and matched by an immutable trigger revision into one deduplicated logical run. Temporal dispatches an ordinary session; provider-specific review or incident features are adapters over this substrate.
- **Knowledge**: canonical source content, findings and groups in Postgres, with original files in object storage and rebuildable search indexes. First-party `knowledge_*` tools use accepted Agent learning policy: Automatic publishes, Review first stages a nonblocking revision, and Off disables agent writes. Search defaults to published records; explicit `view: "needs_review"` lets agents inspect and update pending entries and collections without approving them. Pending content is unapproved context, never behavioral authority. Reuse IDs/current versions instead of duplicating proposals on each scheduled run. Connected-source schedules run ordinary agents with frozen source selections; source fetching is an attempt-bound tool. Conversation history and temporary task notes remain separate. See `docs/knowledge.md`.

## Source Discovery Workflow

For architecture, documentation, implementation, debugging, or operational work, create a current picture from code:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` for operator intent and warnings.
2. Read contracts for names and public shapes.
3. Read API routes for current endpoints and behavior.
4. Read DB schema and event append/list code for durable state and ordering.
5. Read worker workflows/activities for orchestration and side effects.
6. Read runtime code for Agents SDK, sandbox, MCP, manifests, resume, and model provider behavior.
7. Read config parsing for environment variables and pluggability.
8. Mark every claim as shipped, configurable, delegated to a backend/provider, or roadmap/not shipped.
9. For workspace/auth/billing changes, run or inspect `scripts/check-workspace-billing-static.ts` and the workspace isolation integration test so old route/provider-boundary drift is caught.

Do not rely on this skill for exact route lists, env var lists, event types, model names, or backend names. Re-discover those from contracts/config/routes every time exactness matters.

## Code Change Workflow

Before editing, identify which layer owns the behavior:

- Public API or validation: routes, core domain helpers, contracts, tests.
- Persistence: DB schema, migrations, mapping functions, integration tests.
- Event semantics: append helpers, event bus, SSE replay, frontend timeline handling.
- Orchestration: Temporal workflow/signal/activity code and workflow tests.
- Agent runtime: runtime package, worker activity, OpenAI Agents SDK integration tests.
- Sandbox resources: resource validation, manifest building, object storage, sandbox environment.
- MCP tools: config parsing, runtime tool preparation, API MCP servers.
- Scheduling: scheduled task contracts/routes/core domain helpers, Temporal schedule mapping, dispatch activity.
- Event-triggered automation: automation contracts/routes/core adapter registry, FORCE-RLS source/event/run state, bounded Temporal dispatch, and the provider adapter layered above it.
- UI: `apps/web` API helpers/types/components.

For pull-request delivery, preserve immutable candidates across a moving base:

- Before any push or exact-head rotation, inspect the leaf failed jobs and
  steps; aggregate or dependent gates are consequences, not independent root
  causes. Classify each leaf as candidate-caused, base-caused, transient
  runner/dependency, or superseded/cancelled.
- For an identical-head transient install, extraction, dependency, or runner
  failure, rerun failed jobs only. Do not edit source or rotate the head to
  manufacture new evidence.
- Start from current `main`, but do not merge or rebase `main` again merely
  because it advances while CI or review runs.
- “Current-main compatible” requires a fresh mergeability/merge-tree and
  material-overlap check against current `main`; prove it with a disposable
  current-main merge and inspect the integrated tree. It does not require
  current `main` to be present in the candidate's ancestry.
- Base drift alone does not create a new candidate version or invalidate a
  head-bound review. Refresh base-bound evidence on the same head when a
  release contract requires it.
- Change the source head only for a source defect, actual conflict, or material
  semantic incompatibility. Create a commit only to repair that real defect or
  conflict; never create an empty or evidence-only head rotation. After two
  substantive repair revisions, stop for an incident/scope review instead of
  continuing an unbounded repair loop.
- Watcher and continuation prompts must explicitly say “verify compatibility
  without source mutation”; never tell a source owner to “reconcile again” for
  ordinary protected-branch movement.

The executable contract is `.github/workflows/source-admission.yml` plus
`scripts/check-source-admission.mjs`: freeze-head admission applies only to
`hotfix/*` PRs into `production`. Ordinary PRs into `main` use focused CI
without that workflow. Immutable stale-event hotfix heads remain admissible
while protected `production` advances. `AGENTS.md` owns the full repository
delivery invariant.

After edits, run the smallest relevant verification first, then broader checks if behavior crosses boundaries. Common checks are:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run test:integration
bun scripts/check-workspace-billing-static.ts
```

Use the full local stack only when the task requires real Temporal/NATS/Postgres/sandbox behavior:

```bash
bun run dev
```

For infrastructure and deployment work, read `references/deployment-infrastructure.md`, `packages/deployment`, `docs/deployment.md`, `deploy/helm/opengeni`, `deploy/terraform/`, and `deploy/stacks/`. Run or inspect `bun run deployment:stack -- --profile <profile>` before making exact deployment claims. Keep public docs focused on reusable operator behavior, not private verification history or cloud-account-specific records.

Do not claim a deployment is operational from static validation, rendered artifacts, deterministic smoke responses, or a sandbox-disabled profile alone. Real deployment confidence requires the selected profile's live dependencies, model provider, sandbox backend, object storage, auth boundary, and conformance checks to match the behavior being claimed.

For production Kubernetes, use official upstream charts/operators or managed services for platform dependencies. OpenGeni's chart should own OpenGeni workloads and integration resources; built-in Postgres, Temporal, NATS, or MinIO templates are disposable conformance fixtures only and must not be described as the production path.

## File Upload And Sandbox Discovery

When working on file flows, trace the full path end to end:

1. Upload creation route and contract.
2. Object storage key, presigned PUT/GET, TTLs, size/checksum validation.
3. File metadata rows and statuses.
4. Resource validation when attaching a file to a session or scheduled task.
5. Runtime manifest/mount/injection code.
6. User-facing prompt text that tells the agent where files are available.
7. Any result/artifact flow, if present in current code.

The current generic sandbox-output write-back is deliberately narrow: `sandbox_file_publish`
and the matching session API publish one current non-empty `/workspace` file of at most
`25 MiB - 1 byte` into a permanent, integrity-addressed workspace `files` artifact. The
closed receipt exposes only authenticated retrieval metadata. A historical raw sandbox
link may invoke that route when selected, but publication uses the file's current bytes and
does not rewrite message/event history. Do not generalize this into automatic retention of
every sandbox file, live mid-session remount, or an unbounded artifact system.

## Sandbox Backend Discovery

Lease-owned Modal creation is fenced at `modal-create-boundary.ts`, before the
physical RPC, and attributed through `modal-create-session.ts` before setup.
Unknown outcomes retain their epoch/checkpoint. Historical positive discovery
must match the same provider namespace; absence never permits replay. The
maintenance activity attributes receipts; ordinary draining owns termination.
See `docs/run-lifecycle.md` before changing this boundary.

For sandbox pluggability or adding a backend:

1. Find the current `SandboxBackend` contract.
2. Find config for backend-specific settings.
3. Find the runtime function that constructs the sandbox client.
4. Find manifest/resource construction.
5. Find resume/session-state handling.
6. Find environment/secret injection and any sandbox lifecycle hook logic.
7. Check tests for backend expectations.

Describe the backend contract in terms of the OpenAI Agents SDK sandbox client/session capabilities used by OpenGeni. Add a new backend by extending contracts/config, wiring a compatible SDK sandbox client, supporting manifests/resources/resume as needed, and adding tests.

For sandbox configuration work, read `references/sandbox-configuration.md`. Use it when configuring any sandbox backend (Docker, Modal, local, none, the cloud backends, or a Connected Machine / `selfhosted`), deciding which environment variables enter the sandbox, debugging resource mounts, explaining sandbox preparation profiles and lifecycle hooks, adding a sandbox backend, or checking what claims are safe for docs/marketing.

## Tools And MCP Discovery

For unified Skills work, start with `docs/design/skills-system.md`. Server-side
file primitives and packaged guidance live in `packages/runtime/src/skill-files.ts`,
`skill-library.ts`, and `runtime-skills.ts`; worker gateway adapters live under
`apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn/skill-*.ts`. Distinguish a tested adapter
from its live registration and persisted lifecycle. Native packaged guidance can
be read without sandbox staging via `loadNativeToolSkillArtifacts`; do not infer
embedding selection controls or Connected Machine visibility from that helper.
`packages/contracts/src/skill-metadata.ts` owns the shared YAML interpretation.
Every active Skill's name and description come from `SKILL.md` frontmatter;
Permanent agent removal uses `skill_remove` through the same Learning/authority
lifecycle as saves. Inspect `0488_permanent_skill_removal.sql` and the Skill
lifecycle tests before changing deletion: approval binds an explicit removal
operation, revisions are physically deleted, and conversations remain unchanged.
database/catalog metadata is a derived projection, never a second edit surface.
Preserve valid YAML bytes and historical revisions. Legacy conversion and
activation guards belong to the maintenance cutover, not a permanent fallback.

For tools and MCP work, distinguish:

- MCP tool providers selected by session/turn/scheduled-task config.
- First-party MCP servers exposed by the API.
- Built-in SDK sandbox capabilities for shell/files, and OpenGeni's separate Skill catalog and reader.
- Tools available inside the sandbox image, such as CLIs.

Managed Codemode clients are release-owned, not image-version-owned. Inspect
`packages/runtime/src/sandbox/codemode-client.ts` and the runtime/process build
scripts for the bundled CLI/ESM asset. Warm managed boxes receive verified,
content-addressed clients during setup; per-exec PATH and
`OPENGENI_CODEMODE_CLIENT_MODULE` select the release without changing the manifest.
Do not repair stale clients by weakening catalog integrity or choosing npm latest.

Find current MCP behavior in config parsing, tool validation, runtime `prepareTools`, and API MCP server builders. Treat first-party document/file/scheduled-task tools as swappable defaults. If a user wants enterprise search, repo tools, web tools, or custom systems, point OpenGeni at a different MCP server if current config supports it.

## Scheduling Discovery

For queueing or scheduling work:

1. Inspect turn queue state and claim logic.
2. Inspect Temporal schedules and overlap policy mapping.
3. Inspect scheduled task run records and dispatch behavior.
4. Inspect REST and MCP surfaces.
5. Check whether retries, dead letters, quotas, or backpressure are implemented before claiming them.

Prefer precise language: "DB-backed per-session queued turns" is different from "global queue service"; "Temporal schedule overlap policy" is different from "complete scheduling platform."

## Safe Claims

Use careful wording:

- "OpenGeni is self-hostable" if the repo still includes local/deployable API, worker, DB, NATS, Temporal, and object storage config.
- "Session-based public API" if routes/contracts still expose sessions/events/turns.
- "Durable replayable event log" if session events are still stored and replayed by sequence.
- "Temporal coordinates work" if workflows/activities remain present.
- "Agents SDK runs in worker activities" if runtime calls remain in worker activity code.
- "Sandbox backend is pluggable" if backend selection and SDK client wiring remain configurable.
- "MCP tools are pluggable" if MCP server config and tool refs remain.
- "The first-party docs MCP exposes Knowledge retrieval tools" only after verifying the `docs` allowed tool list in `packages/config/src/index.ts`.

Avoid absolute claims until verified in current code:

- Auth, tenancy, RBAC, API keys, billing, and RLS unless verified in current code and tests.
- Webhooks and outbound event delivery.
- Exactly-once public API idempotency.
- Dead-letter queues or automatic retries.
- Network policy/egress controls.
- Artifact storage/write-back beyond the bounded flows verified in current code.
- Any specific cloud/deployment target beyond configured dependencies.
- Any exact model/backend/tool list.

## Keeping This Skill Current

Update this skill in the same change whenever the repo changes any of these:

- Core architecture: API/worker/runtime/storage/event-bus boundaries.
- Terminology: session, turn, goal, event, resource, tool, schedule, sandbox, activity, workspace environment.
- Run lifecycle: the goal continuation loop, the no-run-length-limits principle, and the three-store session memory model (history items / run-state blob / event log).
- Public workflow: how to create sessions, stream events, upload files, attach resources, approve/interrupt, schedule tasks.
- Product integration boundary: organization API-key administration,
  `ensureWorkspace`, organization-workspace wire kind, Personal-workspace
  exclusion, and external inline Skill ownership.
- Pluggability model: sandbox backend contract, MCP tool config, model provider config, object storage, GitHub integration.
- Compute targeting: the Connected Machine (`selfhosted`) primary-compute model, the machines/enrollment routes, per-session `workingDir`, and the `targetSandboxId` create field.
- Source layout: if important files move or names change.
- Important "do not claim" guardrails.

Keep the skill stable and discovery-oriented. Do not copy long API references, full env lists, or large technical briefs into `SKILL.md`; instruct future agents how to find current details in code. If exact details become too large but repeatedly useful, add a focused `references/` file and link it from this skill.
