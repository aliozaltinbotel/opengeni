# CUA desktop pilot

Experimental macOS adapter and narrow Windows experiment for `@trycua/cua-driver` 0.30.4. **Not ready
for deployment or replacing the native backend.** The native backend remains the
default. Browsers, attached Chrome, browser profiles and browser input are unchanged.

`ComputerBackend` owns desktop operations. `ComputerDriver` adapts those operations
to the existing Opengeni controller, operation receipts and frame stream. The CUA
adapter translates desktop calls only. It does not add an authorization system or
another operation journal. Machine/session access remains enforced above it.

Semantic invoke and context-menu actions use CUA's native `button` contract:
`left` and `right`, respectively. SDK 0.30.4 supports both; upstream 0.31's typed
click input rejects the older `action` field. This compatibility does not adopt
the unreleased SDK.

For source-mode experiments, select `OPENGENI_BROWSERD_COMPUTER_BACKEND=cua` with
the existing desktop environment mode. Only one CUA session may own this process's
physical desktop. Existing macOS accessibility and screen-recording permissions
are required; the adapter does not request permissions or silently front apps.
Windows requires an unlocked interactive user session on `WinSta0/Default`;
the existing-seat allocator reads the actual session and desktop. SSH/service
Session 0 is refused. Windows identity, UIA roles, advertised Invoke/SetValue
patterns and native capture IDs remain Windows data through the same controller.
Windows pointer/keyboard input is not admitted by this experiment.

The macOS adapter advertises `backgroundInput` because pointer and keyboard delivery
targets the selected window without taking desktop focus. The viewer accepts
those clicks and keystrokes directly. Native backends that omit this capability
retain their foreground-window guard; background semantic controls are separate.

From this package, run:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun test test/cua-backend.test.ts
OPENGENI_CUA_E2E=1 bun test test/cua-computer.e2e.test.ts
OPENGENI_CUA_PACKAGING_E2E=1 bun test test/cua-runtime-packaging.e2e.test.ts
```

The live test compiles a disposable AppKit window, verifies text replacement,
semantic clicks, replay without a second click, PNG streaming, pixel clicks and
repeated scrolling. Input is checked against the fixture's independently written
state. Only its own window is closed. The test also characterizes the following
known failures; a passing characterization is **not** full adoption acceptance.
Run it on an unlocked desktop. The packaging test needs no desktop permissions:
it compiles the actual SDK loader, reads permission status from the staged native
library, then removes the adjacent SDK and verifies that no ambient installation
can replace it. The macOS native CI leg runs that test and stages both architectures.

## Remaining acceptance gaps

- **Semantic actions with a live viewer:** CUA 0.30.4 replaces its accessibility
  snapshot on screenshot-only reads. A viewer frame invalidates an agent's earlier
  element handles. Reading the initial image before the initial semantic snapshot
  fixes cold startup, but does not solve a continuously running viewer. Resolve
  this at the capture/observation boundary; do not paper over it with retries or
  guessed replacement element references.
- **Mac background drag:** the released SDK explicitly rejects it before posting
  input. The adapter reports unsupported. Foreground delivery needs integration
  with Opengeni's explicit desktop focus/control behavior and independent testing.
- **Compiled releases:** the SDK's platform-library resolver cannot find its
  native package inside Bun's compiled virtual filesystem. `stage-cua-runtime.ts`
  bundles its unmodified JavaScript and stages the pinned native package with its
  notices. Signed native bytes join the existing immutable embedded helper
  generation, and compiled controllers load that adjacent SDK, including Bun's
  Windows virtual-filesystem path. Release staging remains macOS-only. Source mode uses
  the normal pinned package. Canonical release CI and signed application acceptance
  remain required; packaging alone does not resolve the live-viewer failure.
- App launch, whole-desktop capture, clipboard, native hover and foreground focus
  are not yet exposed. Linux and Windows have not completed adoption acceptance.
  Windows capture has no macOS frame-valid flag: exact native capture identity,
  PNG bytes/dimensions and absence of a capture error are required. Full Windows
  capture fidelity still requires acceptance. SDK 0.30.4 omits UIA password
  metadata, so Windows Edit values are redacted by policy; labels copied from
  those values are omitted. Exact element references and advertised actions remain.

Pointer frames supply coordinate dimensions, not one-shot action permission.
Repeated scroll/drag requests may use the same displayed frame. No new screenshot
is required for each gesture. CUA background pointer delivery remains targeted at
the selected PID and window. The current scroll API accepts wheel notches rather
than pixel deltas; the adapter maps a conventional 100-pixel wheel step to one notch.
