//! macOS desktop FFI, wrapped behind a small **safe** API.
//!
//! This is the leaf crate that lets the Opengeni agent's desktop backend drive a
//! real Mac: ScreenCaptureKit screenshots, CGEvent synthetic input, and the TCC
//! (Screen Recording + Accessibility) preflight/grant calls. All of that is Apple
//! FFI — `objc2` message sends, C functions, ARC/pointer handoff — which is
//! inherently `unsafe`.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists (the `unsafe_code` boundary)
//!
//! The agent workspace pins `unsafe_code = "forbid"` (`agent/Cargo.toml`). A
//! scoped `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` inside a crate that inherits that `forbid` does
//! not compile (`E0453`). So this one leaf crate lowers *itself* to
//! `unsafe_code = "deny"` (see its `Cargo.toml`) and confines **every** `unsafe`
//! to the single [`ffi`] module (declared with `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`). The rest
//! of the crate — and every *other* crate in the workspace, including
//! `opengeni-agent-platform` which calls this crate — keeps `forbid`/`deny`
//! intact and only ever touches the safe wrappers below.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! Everything native is `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`. On any other target the
//! public functions are honest stubs (`None` / [`MacFfiError::Unsupported`]) so
//! the crate is a warning-clean skeleton that the workspace still compiles for
//! Linux/Windows — the objc2 dependencies are themselves cfg-gated to macOS and
//! are pulled in on no other platform.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! [`capture_rgba`] retains the legacy main-display framebuffer contract;
//! [`list_displays`], [`capture_display_rgba`], and [`inject_display_batch`]
//! expose every display independently. Pointer coordinates remain local capture
//! pixels and are mapped through that exact display/window's global logical
//! bounds before CGEvent posting—the same point-vs-pixel care the Linux X11
//! backend takes.
