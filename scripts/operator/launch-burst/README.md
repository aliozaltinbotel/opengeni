# Launch burst preparation

**Prepared, not executed. This is not a load-test PASS.** Live execution requires
both staging gates and a **new capacity-parent message authorizing the exact wave**.
No tiny smoke, signup, model prompt, session, sandbox create/shell, server allowlist
change, CI dispatch, deployment, or production action is part of preparation.
The paced enrollment path below is source preparation only: no current gate
clearance or authority to enroll humans or release prompts is established here.

## Reused source paths

- `scripts/operator/connected-machine-load-profile.ts`: bounded execution and
  nearest-rank quantiles only. Its warm-up and direct terminal load runner are NOT run.
- `packages/sdk/src/sse.ts`: production incremental SSE parser, including fragmented
  UTF-8/CRLF and cancellation. Gaps/closes are explicit failures, not hidden retries.
- `packages/runtime/src/sandbox/exec-banner.ts`: only SDK metadata before `Output:`
  proves command exit. A forged exit line in command output is not proof.
- `test/e2e/organization-onboarding-acceptance.e2e.ts`,
  `apps/api/test/managed-onboarding.test.ts`,
  `apps/api/test/managed-auth-session-sets.integration.test.ts`: public verified
  signup and normal name-only organization setup / Personal workspace. Database
  seeding, synthetic verification, admin keys, and setup invitation shortcuts are
  not reused.
- `packages/config/src/index.ts` and `packages/core/src/default-session-model.ts`:
  actual `gpt-6-luna` credits default / `xhigh`, not an invented model alias.

Every new file is in this subtree. The standalone `tsconfig.json` deliberately
avoids edits to worker-owned shared script configuration. Unit discovery already
discovers `*.test.ts`; run this isolated typecheck explicitly.

## Separate waves

| Intent | Participants | First turn | Model choice |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `plain.intent.json` | 100 existing-user sessions | Just `OK`, no tools or sandbox | Explicit `gpt-6-luna`, `low` |
| `sandbox.intent.json` | 100 existing-user sessions | Exactly one `/bin/true` exec, terminal exit, then `OK` | Explicit `gpt-6-luna`, `low` |
| `fresh50.intent.json` | 50 genuinely fresh signups | Same one-command first turn | Omit model/effort; assert actual credits Luna `xhigh` |
| `fresh100.intent.json` | 100 **different** fresh signups | Same one-command first turn | Omit model/effort; assert actual credits Luna `xhigh` |

Each wave gets its own run ID, identity cohort, authorization, output, and
before/during/after telemetry window. No automatic second wave or retry exists.
First authenticate/onboard and verify defaults, then release all ready prompt
creates together. `promptLaunchSpreadMs` reports actual client launch skew;
record whether it is below one second, rather than merely calling it simultaneous.
Failed signup/default preparation stays in the original all-user denominator.
The fresh waves measure 50/100 simultaneous genuine fresh-user **first turns**,
not simultaneous signup throughput. Existing-user preparation remains concurrent.

Fresh flow: public `/v1/auth/sign-up/email` → actual delivered verification link →
public legacy sign-in or isolated session-set transaction/select → verified
`get-session` identity → required onboarding with no memberships →
`organization-onboarding` (`useCase: cloud`) → exactly one Personal membership →
workspace `model-catalog` with `defaultSelection.source=credits`, Luna, `xhigh` →
normal `POST sessions` **without** model or effort. Signup response identity/date
must match the verified human, and the account must have been created in this
signup request (one-second clock-skew tolerance). Missing evidence fails closed.
The runner neither grants credits nor saves defaults nor connects subscriptions.
Collect normal verified-signup trial ledger provenance through Monitoring where
available; model-catalog evidence alone is not a claim about the grant amount.

### Serial enrollment, concurrent first turns

Fresh enrollment completes one entire verification/auth/onboarding/default pipeline
at a time. `freshEnrollmentGapMs` defaults to 3100 and cannot be less than 3100.
The gap starts **after the prior pipeline settles**, including failures, not after
its signup request. This preserves at least 3100 ms between consecutive users'
signup, verification and signin routes even with variable mailbox latency.
The locked Better Auth database limiter is **inactivity-reset**, not rolling-window:
each admitted request refreshes the per-client/per-path `lastRequest`, and a
20-request counter resets only after **more than 60 seconds without admission**.
Uninterrupted 3100 ms spacing alone therefore rejects the 21st enrollment.
`freshEnrollmentBatchSize` defaults to 20 and cannot exceed 20. After every batch
of settled pipeline **attempts**, `freshEnrollmentResetCooldownMs` replaces the
ordinary gap with at least 61000 ms after settlement (default 61000). Failed or
partial enrollments consume slots too; failures never reset the batch count.
A slow pipeline does not substitute for this post-settlement cooldown. These
counts do not reserve capacity against unrelated traffic sharing the same egress
address: HTTP 429 remains an honest failure, with no retry or bucket evasion.
The per-user signup deadline starts after pacing; waiting in the cohort queue
does not consume that user's deadline. STOP and gate expiry are checked during
pacing/mailbox waits and before release. A cutoff or expired gate blocks the whole
dispatch, including already-ready users; failures remain in the original denominator.

No sessions or turns are created during enrollment. Human cookies stay only in
isolated in-memory jars. Once enrollment settles, the same exact dual-gate
authorization is revalidated immediately before releasing ordinary concurrent
session POSTs with initial prompts and fresh model/effort omitted. There is no
earlier prompt, warm-up, credential export, persisted enrollment, or resume path.

The earliest-to-final enrollment span has a default pacing floor of **267.7 seconds
for 50 users / 538.5 seconds for 100**: 49/99 ordinary 3.1-second gaps, replacing
two/four gaps with 61-second resets. Add the actual complete pipelines, including
mail delivery and onboarding. This is not a signup-latency baseline or prompt TTFT.
The aggregate `enrollment` windows/duration/total pacing wait, `ordinaryWaitMs`,
`resetWaitMs`, and per-user `enrollmentStartedAt`, `enrollmentSettledAt`,
`enrollmentPacingWaitMs`, `enrollmentResetWaitMs` are content-free
and separate from `signupMs` and prompt latency. A slow cohort can exceed the real
maximum 30-minute authorization TTL and create **zero sessions** despite partial
account enrollment. That is an honest blocked wave, not grounds to extend the
gate, drop users, persist cookies, retry, or dispatch a smaller unauthorized wave.

## Offline commands (safe now)

```bash
bun --no-env-file test scripts/operator/launch-burst/offline.test.ts
bun --no-env-file node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit -p scripts/operator/launch-burst/tsconfig.json
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/run.ts
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/run.ts --dry-run --intent scripts/operator/launch-burst/sandbox.intent.json
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/run.ts --dry-run --intent scripts/operator/launch-burst/fresh50.intent.json
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/run.ts --dry-run --intent scripts/operator/launch-burst/fresh100.intent.json
```

Default execution prints only intent, its canonical SHA-256, and zero remote
requests. It does not inspect cohort credentials, invoke mailbox/checkpoint/stop
callbacks, or fetch configuration. Offline fixtures inject an in-memory transport;
they do not start even a loopback app/Temporal/DB/model/sandbox service.
Rate regressions invoke the API's locked Better Auth `onRequestRateLimit` database
consumer with the actual source rules, a pure memory adapter and virtual time;
global fetch/preconnect are forbidden. They prove the old 21st-admission failure,
the strict 60-second idle boundary and admitted 50/100 legacy/dual/broker cohorts.
Session-set transactions keep their isolated protocol fixtures; they are not
misrepresented as Better Auth HTTP limiter routes.

## Gated execution recipe — DO NOT RUN yet

The capacity parent alone issues authorization **after** reliability confirms API
memory/OOM, worker cleanup self-termination, empty output, and stuck wakes fixed
on staging, and Monitoring confirms Launch dashboard LIVE on staging. Shape checks
cannot authenticate those external confirmations; the parent's independently held
token plus immutable message/confirmation references are operator evidence, not
automatic gate detection. There is no approval generator in the harness.
For a fresh wave, the **new** exact-source/intent/cohort authorization must cover
both serial enrollment and concurrent first-turn dispatch. Its maximum 30-minute
TTL includes both phases; all gap, batch and cooldown fields are bound by the
canonical intent digest. The runner cannot reauthorize or extend an expired gate.

Keep private inputs/results outside the repository. Cohort schema:

```json
{"schemaVersion":1,"identities":[
  {"kind":"existing","label":"wave-user-001","workspaceId":"<UUID>","cookieEnv":"BURST_HUMAN_COOKIE","actorEpoch":"<selected epoch if session-set>"}
]}
```

For fresh cohorts replace each entry with
`{"kind":"fresh","label":"fresh-001","email":"<new owned test address>","passwordEnv":"BURST_TEST_PASSWORD","organizationName":"Launch test 001"}`.
There must be exactly the intended number of unique labels/emails; fresh and
existing identities cannot be mixed. Existing cookies are canonical managed-human
cookies, never bearer/admin credentials. Export credentials into the operator's
environment without printing them. The local cohort is an explicit identity
allowlist; the runner never changes server allowlists, rate limits, or flags.

The parent's private authorization JSON must match `Authorization` in `config.ts`:
`schemaVersion=1`, parent session ID, actual checked-out full `sourceSha`, dry-run
`intentDigest`, raw cohort file `cohortDigest`, `gateTokenDigest`, reliability's
four true fix flags + dated confirmation reference, Monitoring's true staging
dashboard flag + dated confirmation reference, later parent `authorizationRef`,
`issuedAt`, and `expiresAt` (at most 30 minutes later). Export
`OPENGENI_BURST_PARENT_SESSION_ID` and a new independent secret
`OPENGENI_BURST_GATE_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters). The token is never placed in
argv or output. Head/intent/cohort drift, wrong token/parent, missing flags, or
expired/premature approval rejects **before any remote request**.

After the parent has explicitly authorized **that** exact intent:

```bash
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/run.ts \
  --intent scripts/operator/launch-burst/plain.intent.json \
  --cohort "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/plain-cohort.json" \
  --authorization "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/plain-authorization.json" \
  --output "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/plain-result.json" \
  --stop-file "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/STOP" \
  --execute --confirm-parent-authorized
```

For sandbox use `sandbox.intent.json` and sandbox-specific cohort/authorization/
result paths. For fresh 50, then separately authorized fresh 100, use the matching
intent and paths **plus** `--verification-dir "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/mailbox"`.
The authorized current mailbox owner deposits a mode-0600 regular
`<label>.json` containing only `{ "email": "<same address>", "url": "<actual delivered link>" }`.
The file is private secret input, never a result artifact. Links/callbacks must be
same-origin staging verification paths; redirects are not followed. No paid
integration is added; without an actual authorized mailbox this mode is blocked,
not silently seeded or marked verified.

The CLI refuses a dirty harness, reserves output with `wx`/0600, and consumes an
adjacent `<authorization>.consumed` file before any fetch. Never remove that receipt
to retry; have the parent reconcile outcomes and authorize a new wave. Checkpoints
are serialized, content-free, and durable. The first accepted-session receipt
records both the requested UUID and returned UUID, helping reconcile uncertain
create outcomes without replay. Keep exact-harness source SHA, actual deployed
release, run ID and UTC windows with the result.

## Measurements and acceptance

- Client monotonic TTFT: immediately before initial session/prompt POST to first
  non-whitespace `agent.message.delta`/`completed` text on that exact first turn.
  User/status/reasoning/tool frames and other turns do not count. Subscription
  starts after acceptance, so replayed output is measured when the client receives
  it; this is not a server-only inference latency.
- Acceptance: successful session POST return. Worker start: client observation
  of the earliest `turn.started` on the exact first turn; later recovery/resume
  starts do not overwrite it, including when the first observed latency is zero.
  It includes API/network/dispatch/replay, **not raw Temporal schedule-to-start**.
  Database `session_turns.started_at` can be overwritten on recovery/resume and
  must not be treated as first-start or raw Temporal Scheduled→Started latency.
  Acceptance→latest-resume observations from existing traffic are not a burst
  baseline. Optional event-time receipt→first-output is separately named.
- Signup: monotonic start of actual signup/auth preparation through completed
  onboarding, excluding enrollment pacing and the cohort queue. It is separate
  from prompt TTFT and barrier wait; failures have null
  signup latency, not zero. Exact first-turn/attempt IDs and correlation IDs are
  retained without text, tool output, emails, cookies, verification URLs or secrets.
- Sandbox: client observation and server duration of `sandbox_establish` where
  present; these are broader establishment phases, **not raw provider create or
  readiness durations**. `/bin/true` tool-call→authoritative SDK terminal exit is
  separate. Missing phase/readiness telemetry stays unknown. Plain probes with
  unexpected tools, extra commands, unknown/nonzero exit, empty output, turn
  failure/cancel/supersession, stream gap/close and deadlines are not successes.
- Exact nearest-rank `ceil(p*n)` p50/p95/p99/max from raw milliseconds. Missing
  observations sort as +Infinity and render `unobserved_or_failed`; no tail is
  clamped to 10 seconds or dropped. All original participants stay in success,
  TTFT and successful-completion denominators. Successful-only TTFT is explicitly
  secondary. No initial-attempt failure is replaced by a retry.
- Acceptance target: ≥99% first-turn success and **all-user** client TTFT p95
  <10 seconds, per wave. At 50 users one failure already fails 99%; at 100, one
  failure is 99%. Telemetry, cleanup and capacity acceptance remain separate
  `not_evaluated`, even when the client targets pass.

`opengeni_turn_startup_milestone_duration_seconds_bucket{milestone="first_byte",outcome="completed"}`
is prompt-receipt→reply, completed-outcome only. It is not an all-user success
metric. The pre-extension `STREAM_TTFT_BUCKETS` finite upper bound of 10 seconds
censors the tail; the worker owner extends it. This subtree changes no metrics.

After each wave, Monitoring should export **only** content-free exact workflow/run/
session/turn/activity IDs and `runAgentTurn` ActivityTaskScheduled/Started event IDs
and UTC timestamps. Correlate Started `scheduledEventId` to Scheduled `eventId`
within the same exact run. Retain each retry start; absent starts are pending/unknown,
not zero. A workflow-wide export cannot attribute a logical turn without the
existing attempt/activity fence mapping; preserve `turnId:null` when unavailable.
Never save/log raw history, inputs, results, heartbeat payloads or secrets.

```bash
bun --no-env-file run scripts/operator/launch-burst/analyze.ts "$BURST_PRIVATE_DIR/temporal-metadata.json"
```

This analyzer is offline only and rejects payload-bearing/extra metadata fields.
Without Monitoring's metadata export, Temporal schedule-to-start is unsupported,
not approximated from receipt→worker or an aggregate task-queue histogram.

## Monitoring collection / cutoffs

Coordinate read-only exports with the live Launch dashboard owner before execution:
10 minutes before signup begins, every 15 seconds through signup/prompt/terminal
windows, then at least 30 minutes after settlement or the configured scale-down
cooldown plus rollout time. Mark actual UTC first/last prompt and final terminal
times. Preserve missing samples, release changes and collection failures explicitly.
SQLSTATE `57014` from a collection query (statement timeout/query cancellation)
means failed collection and unknown values, **never a healthy empty queue or zero**.
Retain the collection error and query/export provenance; missing values remain
null/unknown rather than being fabricated from a failed query.

Collect API/control/turn worker desired/current/Ready/pending replicas and restart/
OOM reasons; node Ready/allocatable/requested CPU/memory, unschedulable reasons,
autoscaler limits/headroom and scaler activation/pressure; Temporal task-queue and
exact activity waits/errors/backlog; NATS disconnect/reconnect/pressure; DB CPU,
connections/max, IOPS/latency/locks and pool saturation; ingress/auth/model 429s and
5xx; sandbox create/readiness/capacity/unknown operation counts. For each
before/during/after window, record node pool identity, node SKU, CPU architecture
and CPU model where observable; regional and per-family quota limits, usage and
remaining headroom as distinct scopes; infrastructure and application source
revisions, deployed image identities/releases and metric-query/export provenance.
Timestamp changes so code, CPU and host changes are attributable, not blended into
one comparison. Unavailable metadata stays null/unknown; do not infer CPU model
from SKU or fabricate quota headroom. This is an owner-supplied telemetry plan,
not a collector implemented by the harness. Show actual scale-up timing and
eventual scale-back to the admitted baseline; a desired replica increase without
Ready pods is not capacity. Missing observability is work, not PASS.

Parent cutoffs: any new API OOM or worker cleanup self-termination, rising stuck/
empty/unknown operations, >1% initial failures, sustained DB pressure (e.g. CPU or
connections >80% of the admitted limit), missing critical telemetry, or cost budget
reached. Write the supplied STOP file: admission checks cease new prompt work;
local in-flight stream waits check it at most every 250 ms. **Aborting client
observation does not cancel already accepted server/model/provider work.** Parent
must reconcile exact IDs and use normal public Pause/cleanup when authorized.

Terminal turns request public quiescence-fenced session DELETE once, never direct
Modal shell/stop/create. A rejected cleanup remains `failed`; it does not prove
physical sandbox deletion. Unknown/timeouts retain `held_unknown` and get no DELETE.
The owner retains content-free identity/result artifacts before destructive cleanup
and verifies physical scale-back/provider settlement separately.

## Known execution limits

- Public auth uses real ingress/client-IP rate limits. Current source
  (`apps/api/src/auth/managed-auth-rate-limits.ts`) permits 20 signup, verification
  and legacy signin calls per minute per client per route. Serial complete
  pipelines plus at least 3100 ms after settlement pace this one-process/egress
  enrollment; they do not emulate 50–100 client IPs or benchmark distributed signup
  throughput. Other traffic sharing ingress limits can still cause honest 429
  failures. Do not spoof forwarding headers, relax auth limits, or substitute
  seeded/admin accounts. Distributed clients and persistent enrollment/resume
  are not implemented; the target remains simultaneous genuine first turns.
- An actual owned mailbox and compatible staging auth configuration are required.
  No OAuth provider, mail delivery integration or server allowlist is provisioned.
- Example USD caps ($5 plain, $10 sandbox, $10/$20 fresh 50/100) are conservative
  **admission reservations**, not estimates of measured bills or hard provider caps.
  Source has no per-session create-request hard USD cap. Monitor billed/model/
  sandbox cost through existing authorized telemetry and STOP at the parent cap;
  in-flight/provider/model reasoning costs can overshoot. Do not claim a hard cap.
- No live staging compatibility, signup delivery, provider quota, Temporal export,
  cleanup quiescence, autoscale, DB headroom or launch acceptance is established
  by offline fixtures. Exact-source independent review and targeted checks must
  complete before source merge; no manual CI dispatch or protection changes.
