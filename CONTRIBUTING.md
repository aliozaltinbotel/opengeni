# Contributing To Opengeni

Thanks for considering a contribution.

## Development Setup

1. Install the exact Bun version in [`.bun-version`](.bun-version), Git, curl, rustup, a C build toolchain, and Docker. See the [local prerequisites](README.md#quick-start).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Fill in the required `OPENGENI_*` values for the workflow you want to test.
4. Start the full local stack:

```bash
bun run dev
```

[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md) covers manual startup,
configuration, the native (no Docker) path, and the web-app walkthrough.

## Toolchain

Package manager is Bun everywhere (one intentional npm exception for release publishing).
Typecheck runs on the pinned stable TypeScript 7 `tsc`. See
[`docs/toolchain.md`](docs/toolchain.md) for what runs typecheck/lint/format and why.

## Checks

Run the normal PR check before opening a pull request:

```bash
bun run check
```

For quick local iteration, run:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun test
```

For broader changes that touch persistence, orchestration, sandboxing, or the web/API boundary, also run:

```bash
bun run test:integration
bun run test:e2e
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Update README or docs when setup, public API, configuration, or user-facing behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets, local `.env` files, generated credentials, or private infrastructure details.
- Keep a reviewable candidate head frozen while CI and review run. Ordinary PRs
  into `main` do not run freeze-head source admission; that check is for
  `hotfix/*` into `production`. If `main` advances, verify mergeability and
  material compatibility; do not merge or rebase unrelated `main` commits into
  the branch solely to make it look current.
- Treat candidate/version labels as substantive source revisions. Base-only
  evidence refreshes stay on the same head. Change the head only for a source
  defect, actual conflict, or material semantic incompatibility.
- PR CI in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) checks out
  the exact PR head, not GitHub's synthetic merge commit. Closing and reopening
  an unchanged PR starts another run of the same source; it does not incorporate
  fixes from a newer base. Keep current-main integration evidence separate from
  exact-head CI evidence.
- Workflow-owned registry regressions run from the exact workflow revision, even
  when a frozen candidate predates them. Candidate builds, impact and admission
  retain exact candidate authority; incomplete tooling and failed tests never
  become capability-based skips.
- Before retrying a failed check, inspect its failing leaf and checkout SHA.
  If the candidate contains a real defect already fixed on `main`, apply the
  necessary scoped correction to the candidate and run review and CI on that new
  head. An unchanged-head retry needs evidence of a transient failure, not an
  expectation that moving `main` changed the tested source.

## Keeping Docs True

Use [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) as the docs map. If you move or rename files or packages, run `bun run check:docs-refs` and fix the current-tier references it reports. New packages need a package README plus an update to the [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) package table. New embed surfaces or ports belong in [`docs/embedding.md`](docs/embedding.md). New processes or commands belong in their canonical home from the docs map; link there instead of copying volatile details into multiple docs. The public product docs at docs.opengeni.ai live in [`docs-site/`](docs-site/README.md) and are deployed by Mintlify from `main`; update them in the same change when user-facing behavior they describe moves.

## Release / Publishing

Release and publishing guidance starts here; executable truth lives in [`package.json`](package.json) and the workflow files under `.github/workflows/`. When publishable packages change, keep changesets, package manifests, and the release workflow expectations aligned.

`main` is the daily integration branch. GitHub's default branch stays `main`. `production` is the official source pointer, not a live-cluster deploy. Staging pins already-baked `canary-sha-<commit>` images from a `main` SHA; it does not auto-deploy on merge.

**Promote `main` → `production`:** open a GitHub PR with base `production` and compare `main`. Merge with a **merge commit** (never squash, never GitHub rebase-and-merge: both rewrite SHAs and poison the next promote). The extra merge commit lives only on `production`. The next ship is the same PR shape again. Do not PR `production` back to `main` just because of that merge commit. Do not force-push `production`.

**Hotfix:** PR `hotfix/*` into `production` (freeze-head source admission applies). Then merge `production` → `main` with a merge commit so daily work is not stranded. Squash remains allowed on PRs into `main`.

**Official cut:** dispatch `open-version-pr.yml` on `main` (or set `VERSION_PR_ON_PUSH=true`). Merge the Version PR, promote that SHA to `production`, then `workflow_dispatch` the evidence-bound candidate / acceptance / publication workflows. Do not commit version bumps onto `production`. Official source ancestry is `origin/production`. The `production` pointer already exists; do not recreate it and do not force-push.

**Staging:** dispatch `staging-canary-dispatch.yml` with any `main` SHA whose `canary-sha-*` tags already exist. Pending changesets are allowed. Missing tags fail closed; do not rebuild unsigned `:ci` images.

**Canary packages:** dispatch `publish-canary.yml` on `main` with `source_sha` equal to that workflow run's exact `main` commit. The workflow, checked-out source, and publisher must all be that commit; an older ancestor is rejected. The workflow uses pinned Bun to build and pack, then the official publishing library under Bun with registry-token authentication and GitHub OIDC provenance. It publishes `{next-patch}-canary.N` with dist-tag `canary` (committed `1.0.0` publishes `1.0.2-canary.N`, skipping a retired patch), so canaries sort after the committed release. It does not consume changeset files or move `latest`; a new package with no `latest` tag remains without one.

All archives are packed and frozen before the first write. Each topological
publication retains an intent and a positive library HTTP acknowledgement before
the next write; write retries are disabled. Receipt visibility is checked afterward
in one bounded read-only phase, preserving latest, archive integrity, canary tag
and provenance metadata checks. Site pins appear only after the complete cohort
matches. Acknowledgements are not independent signed-byte acceptance. An uncertain
write stops without replay. Bounded safe receipts survive ordinary workflow failure;
a lost runner can still lose its artifact. Existing versions are never repaired in place.
The final gate rereads the complete cohort within the original shared deadline,
read quota and custody caps. These reads do not claim an atomic registry snapshot.
Post-write receipt polling selects the current dist-tags document and the exact
immutable version manifest rather than unrelated historical versions. Both GETs
count toward the same 256-request budget and share one per-observation signal;
the 180-second deadline and existing byte limits are unchanged. Pre-write discovery
and occupied-version/stable-tag guards still use their existing metadata path.

**Receipt-only recovery:** after a failed canary workflow has acknowledged its
entire cohort, `reconcile-canary-publication.yml` can observe that exact source,
run and attempt without publishing again. The protected current controller reads
historical source only as immutable JSON data. It requires the original provider
failure, absent Site artifact, bounded receipt artifact, complete linked positive
acknowledgements and zero unknown writes. It verifies actual archive/manifest
hashes and official GitHub provenance, then runs the unchanged bounded metadata
poller and final complete-cohort reread. Unknown writes, expired/ambiguous artifacts,
unsupported producer protocols, changed latest or superseded canary tags fail
closed; this command cannot repair tags, rebuild packages or dispatch another run.
The new `canary-publication-reconciliation-*` receipt and
`reconciled-site-package-versions-*` artifact retain both controller and failed
origin identities and set `promotionEligible: false`. They never replace the
failed publisher conclusion or masquerade as its missing Site artifact.
Consumers need explicit manual staging authority for this distinct contract;
normal production, promotion, scheduling and image/source checks remain mandatory.
Additional archive/provider GETs have a separate 15-minute stage deadline and
finite byte/request quotas. Metadata still has one 180-second/256-GET/four-parallel
phase with its original custody caps. Official `gh attestation verify` retains
its default public-good TUF trust fetches outside the controlled GET byte quota;
each verifier child, stdio and cache is bounded separately.

In GitHub Actions, `N` has a floor derived from the workflow run ID and attempt
(`run ID * 1000 + attempt`), so retries do not reuse versions hidden by stale
registry tags or staged publication. A visible version at or above that floor
rejects a superseded attempt: dispatch a new workflow instead of retrying the
older one. Fixed package groups remain aligned. An admitted retry publishes a fresh set rather than
overwriting or removing any partially published versions.

**Lockstep versions.** Every published `@opengeni/*` package is in one Changesets `fixed` group and always releases at one shared version (the line restarted at `1.0.0`); a new published package must join that group (`scripts/release/lockstep-version.test.ts` enforces it). Published manifests pin sibling packages exactly (`workspace:*` becomes the exact version), so consumers install every `@opengeni` package at the same version. The retired pre-reset line already burned some 1.x versions (for example `@opengeni/contracts@1.0.1`, `@opengeni/runtime@1.4.2`); `bun run changeset:version` runs `scripts/release/lockstep-version.ts`, which moves the whole group to the next free patch when the computed version is one of them (`1.0.1` → `1.0.2`), and rewrites the new CHANGELOG heading. The retired list in that script is closed history; never publish an `@opengeni` version by hand. After the 1.0.0 publication, an operator runs `bun scripts/release/deprecate-pre-1.0.ts` (dry run) and then `--execute` once to check `latest` and deprecate every pre-reset version.

A publish-coherence rule learned the hard way:

- **Merging a Version PR only creates versioned source; it does not publish.** GitHub branch protection may still require a review to merge into `main`. Ordinary candidate and operator admission bind the merged associated PR, not a later GitHub `APPROVE` or structured PASS body. Merge deliberately, then run the evidence-bound candidate, acceptance, and release workflows for that exact retained source.

### Registry dependency export smoke

`bun run test:publish-consumer` proves a local release train: its sibling tarballs
and overrides intentionally do not prove compatibility with published dependencies.
Build packages, then run `bun run test:effective-dependency-exports` before
publication with Node/npm available. Candidate packing uses `npm pack` with
scripts disabled to preserve publication file/ignore semantics. This stages
the selected consumer dependency closure and exposes ordinary npm range
resolution through a read-only loopback registry: existing dependency versions
use integrity-checked immutable npm tarballs, while genuinely new versions use
the cut's candidate tarballs and their pending stable `latest` tags. Each root
consumer installs its locally packed candidate, including when that root's
version already exists on npm, so registry root bytes cannot hide local imports.
Shipped source, semantic manifest, and non-generated asset drift without a new
version fail. Order-insensitive JSON metadata is normalized; conditional
`exports`/`imports` order is preserved. No workspace links or install overrides
substitute an invalid range.

Generated `dist` `.js`/`.d.ts` files and matching maps outside asset subtrees are
not required to be byte-identical to a published build: the current tsup entry
expansion can depend on filesystem ordering even for identical source. This does
not assert compiled runtime equivalence or replace a reproducible-build check. The export
proof instead runs the actual local root build against immutable published
dependency bytes. Source drift is only detectable for source files actually
shipped in the package; extending generated-output or build-input provenance
checks is separate work.
Frozen Version PR CI and stable publication run this effective guard before any
publish. Ordinary PRs run the hermetic regression because pending changesets do
not yet represent frozen package versions.

The hermetic regression is workflow-owned tooling: CI checks out the immutable
`github.workflow_sha` separately, installs its frozen dependencies, and uses its
Bun pin. It still runs when an older exact candidate predates the guard files.
Missing tooling declarations, tests or helpers and failing tests fail the job
rather than skipping coverage.
The candidate checkout, impact plan, builds, and effective Version-PR closure
remain bound to the selected candidate, with its Bun pin restored afterward.

`bun run test:registry-dependency-exports --candidate` packs each selected package
separately and installs only its declared registry dependency closure, without
sibling candidates, links, or overrides. Build packages first. `--published-source`
instead installs exact workspace versions from npm; `--published` checks current
`latest`, or use `--package @opengeni/react@<version>` to reproduce a historical failure.

Every stable publication route uses the shared `release:publish` prepublication
guard with its admitted publication set. The stable workflows additionally run
registry-only candidate and exact-published modes **after** registry reconciliation.
These postpublication checks fail on an incoherent published closure but do not
undo an npm publish.
Running a registry-only candidate before its prerequisite versions are published
fails intentionally, so this is not a pre-publication gate for an unpublished
release train. Ordinary CI runs the hermetic missing-export regression.

Both modes test normal resolution and the lowest **published** compatible version
of each direct `@opengeni/*` runtime dependency; the effective mode also admits
genuinely new versions from the intended publication set. Browser Vite builds
retain all exports of the selected client entrypoints; Node imports cover the Connect,
contracts, SDK, and Codemode profiles. Initial coverage is bounded to the explicit
profiles in `scripts/test-registry-dependency-exports.ts`: not every package,
subpath, conditional export, intermediate semver version, optional peer behavior,
third-party minimum, native runtime, or computed dynamic import is proven. Add
profiles and regression fixtures when extending the supported closure.

## Code Style

- Prefer existing repository patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep public API and contract changes explicit.
- Treat agent activity retries carefully because model calls, sandbox commands, GitHub operations, and cloud-provider actions can be side-effectful.

## Migration Authoring

- Migrations must be schema-agnostic: they run under a caller-selected schema/search path. Use `current_schema()` in policy/guard queries, and never pin Opengeni tables to `public` or issue `SET search_path` inside a migration.
- `opengeni_app` grant blocks must also be schema-agnostic: use `current_schema()` with dynamic SQL (`EXECUTE format(... %I ...)`) instead of `IN SCHEMA public`, and include default privileges when future tables or sequences must inherit app-role access.
