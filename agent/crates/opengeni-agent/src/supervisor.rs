//! The resiliency supervisor: dial → serve → reconnect, forever, with full-jitter
//! backoff, fast heartbeats, and a clean SIGINT/SIGTERM going-offline.
//!
//! This is the runtime heart of the FOREGROUND run model and the
//! headline resiliency pillar (§10.6). The supervisor:
//!
//! 1. **Dials** the control plane over NATS with the enrollment Account creds and
//!    sends a [`Hello`] (carrying the resume token so the control plane fences by
//!    epoch and recognizes a reconnect vs a fresh enrollment).
//! 2. **Claims one process generation** and subscribes to
//!    `agent.<ws>.<id>.connection.<instance>.rpc`. The exact process subject is
//!    the live routing authority: a cloned credential cannot share or steal its
//!    work. Each [`ControlRequest`] is dispatched to the [`Platform`] and the
//!    response is sent on the message's reply inbox.
//! 3. **Heartbeats** every 5s on the events subject with a metrics sample so the
//!    control plane can dead-detect a vanished agent (§10.6 cadence).
//! 4. On an **unexpected disconnect**, sleeps a full-jitter [`Backoff::standard`]
//!    delay (a ~30s FAST phase of ≤3s retries so a rolling-deploy blip recovers
//!    in seconds, then exponential up to a 10s cap for a prolonged outage)
//!    before reconnecting — NEVER a tight loop (the #1 outage cause). Expected
//!    short-lived NATS credential rotation reconnects immediately. A reconnect
//!    re-subscribes the RPC subject (a fresh subscription), which — together with
//!    the ~5s heartbeat on this same connection — is what restores the machine's
//!    `last_seen`/ping liveness the attach gate reads.
//! 5. On a **clean stop** (SIGINT/SIGTERM) sends a [`GoingOffline`] event and
//!    closes cleanly so the lease flips offline IMMEDIATELY (§23.0), rather than
//!    waiting on heartbeat dead-detection.
//!
//! Resiliency here covers TRANSIENT BLIPS WHILE RUNNING (wifi roam, sleep/wake,
//! NAT rebind). A deliberate stop is offline, not a blip (§23.0).
