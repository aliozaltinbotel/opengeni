# Client Integration Reference

Use this when building or explaining a client that consumes Opengeni as a service. The client may be a SaaS product, internal portal, CLI, SDK, workflow engine, or custom UI. Do not assume the Opengeni source repo is checked out locally.

Canonical source repo: `https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni`.

When the repository is available, `docs/product-integration.md` is the canonical
external-product contract. This reference should summarize and link to it, not
invent a second organization-key, workspace-mapping, or Skill-ownership model.

`.agents/skills/opengeni-client` is the canonical implementation Skill. Update
that tree directly. Do not inject this developer guide into customer-facing
runtime sessions.

## First Determine Context

Ask or infer:

- API base URL for the deployed Opengeni service.
- Product tenant identity and its persisted Opengeni organization-workspace id,
  or the stable external mapping used by `ensureWorkspace`.
- Whether the user needs a browser UI, server-side integration, CLI, SDK wrapper, or docs.
- Whether file upload, repository attachment, MCP tools, approvals, interrupts, or schedules are in scope.
- Which product access mode the target uses: `local`, `configured`, or `managed`.
- Whether the deployment shared-key boundary is enabled, and whether a product gateway, reverse proxy, VPN, or tenancy layer sits in front of Opengeni.
- Whether exact source behavior is needed. If yes, inspect the repo or the deployed service contract rather than trusting this reference.

## Client Mental Model

A client should treat Opengeni as a durable agent-work API:

1. Read client config and capabilities.
2. For an external product, load the server-held organization API key and call
   `PUT /v1/workspaces/external` / `ensureWorkspace` with the authenticated
   product tenant's stable external identity and account id. Persist
   `result.workspace.id`; `result.created` distinguishes create from idempotent
   replay, and the workspace's wire kind is `"shared"`.
3. Create a session with an initial task under `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions`.
4. Subscribe to the workspace-scoped session event stream.
5. Render events into a timeline/status view.
6. Send follow-up user messages or control events.
7. Upload files before attaching them as resources.
8. Attach repositories/files/tools to sessions or turns.
9. Handle approvals, interrupts, failed states, and reconnect/replay.
10. Optionally create and manage scheduled tasks.

The client should not talk directly to the worker, NATS, Temporal, Postgres, or sandbox backend. Those are Opengeni internals.

## Discover The Current Public Surface

If the repo is available, inspect:

```bash
rg -n "app\\.(get|post|patch|delete|all)\\(" apps/api/src
sed -n '1,260p' packages/contracts/src/index.ts
sed -n '1,320p' apps/web/src/api.ts
sed -n '1,260p' apps/web/src/types.ts
```

If only a deployment is available:

- Call the health endpoint if exposed.
- Call the client config endpoint if exposed.
- Use browser devtools or existing UI API calls to infer current paths.
- Ask the operator for API docs or source revision.

## Core Client Flow

Prefer this shape, adjusted to the current contracts:

1. **Prepare access**: for a managed external-product integration, send the
   server-held organization API key as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. For the
   optional deployment shared-key boundary, send `x-opengeni-access-key: <key>`.
   Do not conflate these two keys.
2. **Fetch config**: get product access mode, default model, allowed models, reasoning efforts, MCP providers, and whether file uploads are enabled.
3. **Resolve workspace**: external products call `/v1/workspaces/external` with a
   stable product-tenant mapping. The result must be an organization workspace
   with wire `kind: "shared"`. Personal workspaces are excluded; never use
   `/v1/access/me`'s personal/default workspace as a fallback.
4. **Prepare resources**: upload files under the workspace first; select repository resources from available repo/source picker; select MCP tool providers by id.
5. **Create session**: load the Skills selected by the external product and pass
   them inline in `CreateSessionRequest.skills`, together with the initial
   message, selected resources/tools/model, and compute-target choice to
   `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions`. The compute target is either a managed sandbox (optional `sandboxBackend`, plus the `sandbox` placement union `"shared" | "new" | { groupId }`) or an enrolled **Connected Machine** via `targetSandboxId` — plus an optional per-session `workingDir`, which is valid only alongside `targetSandboxId` (`workingDir` alone is a 422). Optionally pass a workspace-scoped `idempotencyKey` so a retried create collapses to one session.
6. **Connect SSE**: stream events from `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:sessionId/events/stream`. Use the last event sequence as the reconnect cursor.
7. **Render timeline**: display user messages, agent deltas/completions, reasoning, tool calls, sandbox operations, approvals, status changes, failures, and final output according to current event types.
8. **Send follow-ups**: post a user message into the existing workspace-scoped session; the API queues another turn.
9. **Control work**: send interrupt or approval-decision events when the session requires action.
10. **Replay**: on reload or reconnect, list events after the last known sequence before resuming the live stream.

## Event Handling Rules

Use the event log as the source of truth for the UI:

- Store the latest sequence seen by the client.
- Reconnect SSE with the latest sequence or equivalent cursor supported by the current API.
- Do not assume live SSE delivery is complete; replay/backfill from the event list endpoint when reconnecting.
- Treat event types as extensible. Unknown events should be logged or displayed generically, not crash the client.
- Keep status projection separate from raw event storage if building an SDK or UI state model.

## File Upload Flow

The client should not send large file bytes through session creation. Use the upload API flow:

1. Create a workspace-scoped upload with filename, content type, size, and optional checksum.
2. PUT bytes to the returned object-storage URL with required headers.
3. Complete the upload so Opengeni verifies metadata and marks the file ready.
4. Attach the resulting file id as a file resource on a session, turn, or scheduled task.

Do not show file resources as usable until upload completion returns a ready file.

## Resource And Tool Selection

Resources are things made available to the agent, commonly files and repositories. Tools are currently selected as MCP provider references.

Client UX should distinguish:

- **File attachments**: upload, then attach by file id.
- **Repository attachments**: select repo URL/ref/mount information; GitHub App metadata may be needed for scoped token minting.
- **Tool providers**: select configured MCP server ids, such as document search or custom enterprise search.
- **Compute target**: expose only if the product wants users to choose where a session runs; otherwise use deployment defaults. Two distinct axes: a managed **sandbox backend** (a platform-owned ephemeral box; the `sandboxBackend` enum) versus an enrolled **Connected Machine** (user-owned compute addressed by `targetSandboxId` + an optional `workingDir`, run as first-class primary compute — no cloud box behind it, its own git auth, repos not cloned onto it). Do not conflate a **self-hosted deployment** (an operator running the whole Opengeni service themselves — the `configured` product access mode) with a **Connected Machine** (an end user attaching their own machine as a session's compute, possible inside any deployment, managed or self-hosted). `selfhosted` is only the internal `sandboxBackend` enum value for a Connected Machine; prefer the product term in UI copy.

## Approvals And Interrupts

Approvals are part of the session event/control loop:

- When events indicate the session requires action, render the requested approvals.
- Send an approval decision with the approval id and approve/reject decision.
- Keep the stream open or reconnect after sending the decision.

Interrupts should be modeled as cancellation requests, not guaranteed immediate process termination. The worker/workflow decides how the active turn is cancelled and whether queued work continues.

## Scheduling From A Client

If the current API exposes scheduled tasks, a client can provide:

- One-shot task creation.
- Interval task creation.
- Calendar-style recurring tasks.
- Run mode selection if supported: new session per run or reusable session.
- Overlap policy if supported.
- Manual trigger, pause/resume, delete, and run history views.

Examples: nightly infrastructure drift scan, weekly repo review, one-shot migration assistant, recurring compliance check, daily reusable investigation thread.

## Client-Side Copy Guidance

Use client-centered language:

- "Create a session, stream events, and send follow-ups through the API."
- "Use workspace-scoped API paths; resource ids alone do not authorize access."
- "Embed durable agent work into your SaaS without running the agent in your web server."
- "Attach files, repositories, and MCP tool providers to a run."
- "Replay the event log after reloads or network drops."
- "Handle approvals and interrupts as normal API events."
- "Self-hosted (operator-run) configured deployments can use delegated bearer tokens or the deployment shared-key boundary without Better Auth. This is the deployment topology, not the same thing as a Connected Machine (a user attaching their own compute to a session)."
- "Managed deployments use Better Auth for browser sign-up and organization API keys for headless product integration."
- "External product backends use an organization API key, map tenants to organization workspaces (`kind: \"shared\"`), and exclude Personal workspaces."
- "The external backend stores Skills and passes selected definitions inline per session; there is no organization-wide Skill registry or Skill inheritance."

Avoid implying clients call Temporal, NATS, Postgres, the worker, or the sandbox directly.

## Keep This Reference Current

Update this file when:

- Public API route shape changes.
- Contracts for sessions, events, resources, tools, files, or scheduled tasks change.
- SSE replay/reconnect behavior changes.
- Auth/tenancy is added to the base API.
- Organization API-key administration, `ensureWorkspace`, organization-workspace
  mapping, Personal-workspace exclusion, or inline Skill ownership changes.
- Client config capabilities change.
- File upload or repository selection flow changes.
- Compute-target selection (managed sandbox vs Connected Machine), the `targetSandboxId`/`workingDir`/`sandbox`/`idempotencyKey` create fields, active-sandbox swap, machine metrics, or the enrollment flow change.
- New first-class client SDKs are added.
