/**
 * Budgets and authoring style for durable text an **agent** writes on a user's
 * behalf.
 *
 * The budget follows the cost, and the cost differs per destination:
 *
 * - A workspace instruction policy is composed verbatim into the prompt of
 *   every session it applies to, for as long as it stays active. A global
 *   charter or global policy applies to every session in the workspace; a role
 *   policy applies to every session bound to that role. At most three entries
 *   compose at once (charter, global policy, matching role policy), so the
 *   storage limit is shared with the human editor; prompt composition retains
 *   its separate UTF-8 byte bound.
 * - A preference is cheaper and in a different way: only its short title and
 *   description descriptors are prompt-composed, while the full content is
 *   retrieved on demand behind the exact attempt's retrieval handle. Its length
 *   is therefore retrieval cost, not standing prompt cost.
 * - Organization identity and mission are always-on context for root sessions
 *   across the whole organization. Historical company-profile list fields stay
 *   in the storage contract for compatibility; nonempty values on an already-
 *   active historical revision remain composed with an explicit compatibility
 *   label until an organization owner replaces the profile.
 * - Knowledge is retrieval evidence and never joins the always-composed prefix.
 *
 * Instruction writes share the human limit so localized edits can preserve
 * existing long policies. The other caps bind only agent-authored writes.
 * The human-facing limits (`PREFERENCE_REGISTRY_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS`, `COMPANY_PROFILE_SCALAR_MAX_CHARS`,
 * `COMPANY_PROFILE_ENTRY_MAX_CHARS`, `COMPANY_PROFILE_CONTENT_MAX_UTF8_BYTES`)
 * are unchanged: a person editing in the UI is making a deliberate, visible
 * choice, and lowering their limit would reject text they already typed.
 * Existing stored revisions are never rewritten; only new agent writes are
 * bounded.
