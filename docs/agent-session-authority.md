# Agent session authority

A live agent attempt may read, message, and control other sessions in the same
workspace when the caller's outbound `agentAccess` scope allows it. Parent/child
lineage is never an access deny. First-party session tools (`sessions_list`,
`session_get`, `session_events`, `session_wait`, `session_steer`, `session_set_model`,
pause/resume/cancel) are the capability surface; the access scope below is the
lock, and unprompted hijack inside an allowed scope is an instruction problem. `session_wait` authorizes
every watched target exactly as `session_events` does (`session.events.read`)
before it subscribes to live fanout; the caller's own session is always an
allowed self target. Slack-private sessions stay same-root for agents, and
`user_private` still requires the initiating human as owner — this is not a new
impersonation path.

This policy applies only to authenticated `agent_attempt` callers. Human and
service callers continue through their existing workspace, private-session, and
optional embedding-host authorization rules.

`session_get({})` resolves only the session in the authenticated exact agent
attempt claims, then performs the same live-attempt and target authorization as
an explicit ID. A child reads itself, never its parent or root. Sessionless,
human, and operator callers must provide `sessionId`; session-like metadata on
a non-agent grant is not a current-agent context. Explicit IDs retain ordinary
private-session and host restrictions. Both compact and full projections remain
bounded; self reads inspect state, not conversation history. REST/SDK session
reads still require explicit IDs. Attempt catalogs and their generated Codemode
declarations derive the optional field from the first-party MCP schema; an
already-frozen catalog does not change in place.

`session_set_model` requires `sessions:control` and `session.model.write` target
authorization, then rechecks the exact calling attempt under the write lock.
It changes only future model/reasoning defaults, with a durable idempotent receipt.
It never resumes or wakes the target, changes accepted work, or widens the
Codemode SDK proxy. Full `session_get` includes canonical reasoning and latency
alongside the effective model; metadata is not their authority.

## Agent access scope

Every session carries frozen `agentAccess` (`session`, `user`, or
`workspace`; default `workspace`) and a server-derived canonical
`scopeSubjectId`. Native or `asUser` authority establishes that identity;
request bodies cannot supply it or the retired `endUser` label. Children inherit
identity and omitted scope, and may narrow access (`workspace` > `user` >
`session`) but never widen it.

For authenticated `agent_attempt` callers:

- Own-tree access remains subject to ordinary permissions, private-session,
  Slack-private, and optional host checks.
- Outside that tree, a `session` caller cannot reach another task.
- A `user` caller requires the same non-null canonical scope subject.
- A `workspace` caller may reach any otherwise authorized workspace task.
- The target's `agentAccess` never restricts inbound access.

The same predicate filters REST/MCP lists, topology, and Slack discovery through
`SessionAuthorizationListScope.agentAccessViewer`. Human visibility is separate:
private-session ownership and ordinary authorization still apply.

Memory selection is `workspace`, `user`, or `off`. User Memory uses the verified
active-turn user. Children may only narrow the selection. New `session` Memory
requests are rejected; stored historical selectors hydrate as `off`, without
deleting records or making private data workspace-visible. Existing task notes
serve tree-local coordination. The MCP `session_create` tool accepts Memory
selection; access and canonical identity are inherited from trusted authority.

## Relationship policy

The server reconstructs the exact live caller attempt. Caller-supplied lineage
is never accepted. After that, the agent access scope, Slack-private, and
`user_private` owner checks still run. An optional embedding-host `SessionAuthorizationPort` may narrow the
result; it cannot grant a private session OpenGeni already denied, and it cannot
widen a cross-session projection from exact-target to whole-root.

| Target relative to caller | Read | Message (`session.append`) | Mutate/control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self | Yes | Yes | Session-local operations; an agent cannot Steer itself; tool approvals are never agent-decidable |
| Immediate child, parent, sibling, or skipped generation in the caller's own root tree | Yes, subject to private/host checks | Yes, subject to private/host checks | Yes, subject to ordinary permissions and private/host checks |
| Unrelated root, caller `agentAccess: "workspace"` | Yes, subject to private/host checks | Yes, subject to private/host checks | Yes, subject to ordinary permissions and private/host checks |
| Unrelated root, caller `agentAccess: "user"` with the same canonical scope subject | Yes | Yes | Yes, subject to ordinary permissions |
| Unrelated root where caller is `agentAccess: "session"`, or `"user"` with a different or missing scope subject | No | No | No |
| Slack-private session outside the caller's root | No | No | No |
| `user_private` session whose owner is not the initiating human | No | No | No |

Goal tools remain self-only. Compact `sessions_list` discovery still requires a
live attempt.

Related-work matching does not widen this table. OpenGeni resolves the exact
caller and optional host list scope before applying lifecycle/root/parent/
recency filters, matching titles, active goals, or typed work claims, counting
results, or expanding authorized ancestors. A claim is non-exclusive advisory
evidence and grants no read, message, or control authority. The projection's
literal `advisoryOnly` and `noAdditionalAccess` fields are part of the wire
contract; no match automatically Steers, pauses, cancels, reassigns, or messages
a session. See [`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md).

Structured human input versus tool approvals: a live attempt holding
`sessions:control` may answer (or skip, when allowed) another session's
pending structured human-input request through `session_human_input_respond`
(`session.human_input.write`); the answer is recorded as
`respondedBy: agent_attempt:<attemptId>` and resumes that session's blocked
turn exactly like a human answer. A pending tool approval
(`session.approval.write`) is denied to every agent attempt on every surface,
including a child the caller spawned, and an embedding-host port cannot widen
that. The parent learns that a child is blocked through the
`child_requires_action` notice (see
[`durable-agent-inputs.md`](durable-agent-inputs.md)). Production sessions stay `workspace_shared` until visibility
lifecycle is wired; that separate tenancy activation must keep intersecting
these private/host checks rather than replacing them.

Cross-session projections use exact-target mode so a peer read does not receive
parent- or descendant-derived metadata for other sessions.

## Enforcement and composition

`requireSessionAuthorization` in `@opengeni/core` owns the mandatory preflight
check for HTTP, streams, first-party MCP, Codemode, and shared core session
commands. The transactional Agent Message, Steer, Pause, Resume, and Cancel
seam repeats live-attempt, interruption, self-steer, and goal-self fences under
the canonical session and attempt locks. Both validate the exact current attempt
before addressing the target. An optional embedding-host `SessionAuthorizationPort`
runs only after the preflight check and may narrow the result; it cannot widen
private-session access.

Agent-facing Pause guidance names its recursive workstream scope: pausing an
ancestor interrupts the caller too, so it must not be used merely to coordinate
concurrent edits. This is guidance for the existing control semantics, not a new
exception for agent descendants. Message acceptance and queued/updated session
projections do not prove execution. Agents supervising authorized work must
retain the accepted update/turn identity and consumed event cursors. For an
agent message, `session_events` with `view=debug`,
`includeTypes=["system.update.delivered"]`, and `payloadMode=full` exposes the
receipt: match `resource.id` in `payload.updateIds`, then follow its `turnId`
to the relevant result. An unrelated in-flight turn completing is not proof
that the new input was consumed. Inspect blockers instead of duplicating
unconsumed messages. Explicit human pauses and approvals remain authoritative.

Authority never widens down a tree or through a side door:

- `resolveFirstPartyMcpToolsForCreate` rejects a child `firstPartyMcpTools`
  request outside the parent's effective selection, exactly as
  `firstPartyMcpPermissions` were already fenced.
- `PUT /sessions/:id/tool-policy` from an agent attempt may only narrow a
  parentless session's current tools and selection; humans and API keys keep
  the ability to widen a top-level session.
- A scheduled task created by an agent freezes the creating session's effective
  tools, permissions, and `{ agentAccess, endUser, memoryScope }` as its creator
  policy (`packages/core/src/domain/scheduled-tasks.ts`, migration 0428), and
  every session it generates uses that policy instead of deployment defaults.
  Only the task owner's signed-in access refresh re-freezes its tools and
  permissions, within that person's own grants; no agent can call it
  ([`scheduled-task-access.md`](scheduled-task-access.md)).
- The Codemode SDK proxy (`/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/codemode/sdk/*`) mints
  its agent token from the session's permissions intersected with the
  permissions the session's selected first-party tools require, and
  `siteSessionPath` is an explicit method-plus-path allowlist: session list,
  create, read, events, stream, send, queue, and composer drafts. Tool policy,
  visibility, forks, steer, and control are not reachable from a sandbox.
- A session-scoped grant without a signed `firstPartyMcpTools` claim registers
  no first-party tools.

`test/session-agent-access-contract-surface.test.ts` pins every
`/sessions/:sessionId` route and every target-session MCP tool to the seam;
adding a session-read entry point requires updating that allowlist deliberately.

The non-bypassable operational prompt tells the agent to use session tools for
user-requested session management, and to spawn a child worker for a subtask
rather than hijacking an unrelated existing session. The prompt does not widen
authority; the relationship policy above remains the enforcement boundary. A
leaf turn without those tools continues the work itself.
