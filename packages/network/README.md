# `@opengeni/network`

`@opengeni/network` is the low-level outbound transport used by Opengeni's
credential-bearing MCP and OAuth paths. It resolves a destination hostname once,
rejects private and special-use answers unless the caller has explicitly enabled
the local/test or private-target escape, and supplies the vetted address through a
per-request Undici 6.x `Agent` lookup. TLS hostname verification remains enabled:
the URL hostname is still the TLS identity and is never replaced with an IP or
used with `rejectUnauthorized: false`.

The response body owns the dispatcher lifecycle. The per-request agent is closed
after a body completes and destroyed after cancellation, stream failure, or a
fetch failure. This keeps long-lived MCP SSE streams alive while preventing a
completed or abandoned response from retaining a socket pool.

Callers must put credential-resolution wrappers *outside* the pinned transport:

```ts
const guarded = (input: string | URL, init?: RequestInit) =>
  pinnedFetch(input, init, settings, { fetchImpl: undiciFetch });
const withCredentials = resolveHeadersThenCall(guarded);
```

The wrapper must add `Authorization`, API-key, or OAuth form credentials before
calling `pinnedFetch`; the policy resolution and pinned Agent are the final
network boundary. Callers must not preflight with one fetch and then call a
second global fetch.

The pinned transport uses Undici's `request()` implementation from its explicit
`undici/index.js` entrypoint and adapts the result to a web `Response`. This
avoids Bun/Undici `fetch()` body-stream interoperability stalls while preserving
the vetted per-request `Agent`. The separately exported `undiciFetch` remains a
fetch-compatible adapter for callers that do not use `pinnedFetch`. Bun's bare
`undici` specifier resolves to a compatibility shim whose `Agent` does not expose
the required dispatcher methods, and Bun's native `fetch` does not provide a
portable guarantee that an Undici `dispatcher` is honored. This package does not
follow redirects; each caller must make a manual redirect decision and call the
transport again so every hop is independently resolved and pinned.

The default pinned request adapter sends `User-Agent: Opengeni` unless the
caller supplies its own value, including through a `Request` object. This keeps
OAuth discovery and provider requests compatible with servers that require an
identified HTTP client.

The package also exports `readJsonBase64Field` for provider APIs that return
large binary artifacts inside JSON. It validates declared and streamed limits,
decodes canonical base64 incrementally, and avoids retaining the JSON envelope
or encoded string. Callers remain responsible for validating the decoded media.

## MCP OAuth discovery

`resolveMcpOAuthDiscovery` provides the shared MCP OAuth discovery state machine
used by runtime connections and catalog diagnostics. It prefers RFC 9728
Protected Resource Metadata and permits the MCP 2025-03-26 compatibility path
only after every PRM candidate is explicitly absent with HTTP 404 or 410. The
legacy path requires a Bearer/OAuth challenge, RFC 8414 metadata on the MCP
origin, an exact issuer match, same-origin resource binding, and PKCE S256.

The resolver is transport-independent. Its `fetchMetadata` callback must
validate each candidate before I/O, bound response size and duration, disable
automatic redirects, and independently validate and DNS-pin every redirect
hop. It must return `status: "absent"` only for HTTP 404 or 410 and throw for
network, redirect, destination-policy, HTTP, body, and JSON failures; otherwise
an unsafe or unreachable PRM endpoint could be mistaken for legacy absence.
`validateEndpoint` and `canonicalizeResource` provide the caller's deployment
policy and canonical identifier rules.

Successful results include the discovery mode, normalized metadata, structured
classification, and a stable SHA-256 provenance digest. Fail-closed errors carry
classifications for broken discovery, unverified legacy defaults, or a legacy
cross-origin configuration that requires an explicit reviewed profile. These
classifications are diagnostics; callers still decide whether a provider
profile is supported and must perform fresh runtime discovery before granting
credentials.
