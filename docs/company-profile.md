# Organization identity

Organization identity is the single active always-on authority for two small,
stable facts: who the company is and why it exists. It is organization-scoped
(`managed_accounts.id`) and is known across every workspace in that account.
Products, customers, goals, constraints, strategy, and changing facts are
organization-scoped Documents/RAG evidence, retrieved only when relevant. They
are not standing identity fields.

The persistence and public API retain the historical `company_profile` name and
its list fields so old revisions, hashes, snapshots, and integrations remain
readable without mutation. Current product surfaces and new writes use only
`identity` and `mission`. Nonempty list fields on an already-active historical
revision remain prompt-composed as explicitly labeled compatibility context
until an organization owner replaces that profile; this prevents silent context
loss while the organization moves those facts into Documents.

## Scope and authority

There is at most one active company-profile head per account. A workspace id is
required at API and accepted-attempt boundaries only to authenticate the caller,
apply tenant RLS, and identify the consuming session. Workspace membership,
workspace admin, session creation, provenance, documents, collections, memory,
and preference records never widen organization authority.

Reads require `workspace:read` in a workspace belonging to the account. Human
administration requires a direct authenticated human session with the exact
account's `account:admin` (granted to organization owners); `workspace:admin`,
organization admins and members, services, agent attempt grants, and API-key
identity cannot activate or roll back through the admin route. That admission
contract is unchanged by the agent path below; widening it to organization
admins, or narrowing it to the canonical managed-cookie session only, is a
deliberate product decision rather than a side effect of agent administration.

An exact live agent attempt may administer the profile only through the
separate `company_profile_propose` path. Proposal admission resolves the
logical turn's initiating human and requires that human's current active
organization membership to be the `owner` role, i.e. exactly the authority the
manual `account:admin` route requires; an organization admin who cannot use the
manual editor cannot activate through an agent either. A separate
organization-scoped policy, editable only by an active organization owner,
controls the result:

- `off` rejects the operation before a proposal revision is created;
- `suggest` (shown as **Require approval**, and the default for existing and new organizations) creates an
  inactive immutable proposal and requires the bound
  `company_profile_confirm` human-confirmation path;
- `automatic` creates the same immutable proposal and immediately activates it
  through the existing company-profile compare-and-swap lifecycle, without a
  second human prompt.

The policy mode and version are frozen on the proposal receipt. Changing the
policy afterward does not reinterpret an existing proposal, and every mode
still requires an exact live turn initiated by the active organization owner.
Under `suggest`, confirmation requires the canonical question returned by the
proposal to have been answered `activate` by that same human, then revalidates
the current attempt, organization membership, immutable proposal
provenance/hash, and unchanged active-profile head before activation. Under
`automatic`, a dedicated immutable receipt retains the initiating owner,
membership, policy version, exact attempt, proposal, revision, and activation
event; the activation event is attributed to
`service:company-profile-autonomy` so the event actor truthfully describes the
automatic lifecycle writer while the causal owner remains auditable. Proposal,
confirmation, and automatic-activation receipts carry the restrictive
`session_visibility_isolation` policy like every other session-referencing
receipt. The revision uses the distinct `agent_admin` provenance, not
`durable_learning`. MCP authorization supplies only ordinary exact-session
control/read capabilities; organization role is resolved authoritatively in
PostgreSQL, so an agent never receives `account:admin`.

The proposal and confirmation SECURITY DEFINER capabilities follow the
canonical lock order: `workspaces FOR KEY SHARE`, the initiating human's
`organization_memberships` row `FOR KEY SHARE` (the migration 0299 membership
seam orders workspaces, then memberships, then sessions), then the exact
session/turn/attempt rows `FOR SHARE`. Only after that prefix does `propose`
touch `managed_accounts` (`FOR KEY SHARE`) and does reviewed or automatic
activation reach the organization row `FOR UPDATE` through the nested
`company_profile_apply_activation` call. Nothing stronger than
`managed_accounts FOR KEY SHARE` ever precedes the session prefix, so the
capabilities cannot form an ABBA cycle with the canonical event writer, which
holds the session row and then reaches `managed_accounts` through the
`session_events` account foreign key. One residual remains: the nested
`company_profile_apply_activation` (migration 0201) still takes
`managed_accounts FOR UPDATE` after the session/turn/attempt `FOR SHARE` rows,
while the post-0299 membership seam (0263 suspend/offboard) opens
`managed_accounts FOR KEY SHARE` and then locks the target human's sessions
`FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, so an owner confirming while being suspended or offboarded
can be deadlock-detected (`40P01`, both sides retry-safe); the fix is
downgrading `company_profile_apply_activation` to `KEY SHARE` plus the
organization advisory key in the 0299 style (follow-up).

The proposal, confirmation, and automatic-activation paths are idempotent
across replacement attempts of the same logical turn. Their input hashes bind
account, workspace, session, turn, operation id, content/proposal identity, and
the initiating membership, never the attempt id or execution generation (those
are persisted on the receipt rows). After a worker death re-claims the turn at
generation G+1, the same proposal operation id replays. An automatic proposal
replays its original activation receipt, and a `confirm` retry under a fresh
operation id after a successful reviewed activation replays the existing
confirmation for that proposal (same bound human-input request) instead of
reporting a profile conflict. The first reviewed confirmation still requires
the exact content hash and the `P <= R < L` generation rule.

This explicit administration path is not governed learning and never consults
workspace learning mode. In particular, `learning_policy_off` cannot block the
owner's explicit request to manage the organization profile. Agent behavior is
instead controlled by the separate organization-level company-profile policy.
The direct profile administration route remains direct-human-only, as do the
policy read/update routes.

The historical durable-learning adapter remains readable for compatibility.
New products, customers, goals, constraints, strategy, and other changing facts
must go to organization-scoped Documents/knowledge rather than this authority.
Automatic derivation of explorable organization knowledge from sessions and
integrations is a separate retrieval pipeline, not a reason to widen the
always-on prompt.

## Bounded structured content

Each immutable revision retains the compatibility shape:

- nullable `identity` and `mission` strings, each at most 2,048 characters;
- up to 16 keyed entries in each of `products`, `customers`, `goals`, and
  `constraints`;
- normalized stable keys up to 96 characters and entry content up to 1,024
  characters;
- a total canonical JSON ceiling of 28,672 UTF-8 bytes.

At least one field is required. List keys are unique within their section. The
server stores one canonical JSON representation and hashes those exact UTF-8
bytes. The four lists are legacy storage only: current UI and agent proposals
write them empty. Existing revisions are not rewritten, and nonempty historical
lists remain composed with a legacy compatibility label until the next explicit
profile replacement. Richer material belongs in organization-authority
Documents/RAG and is retrieved as evidence.

Those numbers are compatibility ceilings, not targets. Only identity and
mission are always-on prompt context. An **agent** author is bounded more tightly
through `AgentAuthoredCompanyProfileContent`, and the first-party proposal tool
accepts only the two scalar fields:

| Field                                 | Agent bound                      | Human bound           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `identity`, `mission`                 | 400 characters each              | 2,048 characters each |
| legacy list entry                     | not accepted by the current tool | 1,024 characters      |
| whole canonical compatibility profile | 4,096 UTF-8 bytes                | 28,672 UTF-8 bytes    |

Entry counts and total byte bounds remain unchanged so historical payloads keep
validating under the same hash contract. The human `account:admin` API keeps
`CompanyProfileContent` and the wider bounds for compatibility; the current UI
edits only identity and mission and clears the retired lists on the next write.
Existing revisions are never rewritten.

Identity and mission should each be one plain descriptive statement: no
numbered procedure, no marketing copy, no rationale essay, no restating of
platform defaults. The equivalent rule for workspace rules and preferences is in
[`workspace-instruction-policies.md`](workspace-instruction-policies.md).

## Revisions, activation, audit, and rollback

`company_profile_revisions` is append-only immutable history. Every revision
records a monotonic account-local revision number, intent (`active` or
`proposal`), exact content hash, creator, provenance, optional source identity,
and superseded account revision. Operation UUID plus a complete canonical
request fingerprint provides natural-convergence replay; changed input under a
used operation UUID is rejected.

`company_profile_heads` is the one mutable active projection.
`company_profile_activation_events` is immutable audit history. Activation and
rollback serialize on the account row and run only through
`company_profile_apply_activation`, a tenant-, actor-, principal-, and
compare-and-swap-validated `SECURITY DEFINER` lifecycle function. The ordinary
runtime role has read-only access to the head and event tables; trigger fencing
also rejects direct owner mutation outside that function. Each successful call
atomically changes the head and appends exactly one activation event. A stale
writer receives `COMPANY_PROFILE_CONFLICT`; it never silently overwrites newer
truth.

Agent-admin proposals, confirmations, and automatic activations add no second
mutation mechanism. Migration
`0324_human_confirmed_company_profile_agent_admin.sql` routes a confirmed
operation through the same `company_profile_apply_activation` lifecycle and
attributes that event to the confirming human. Migration
`0380_autonomous_company_profile_agent_policy.sql` adds the organization policy
and routes `automatic` through that same lifecycle under the dedicated service
actor while retaining the initiating owner as causal evidence. All policy and
receipt tables are FORCE-RLS, immutable or lifecycle-fenced, and have no direct
runtime table privileges; the runtime role can execute only the bounded
SECURITY DEFINER capabilities.

Rollback creates another immutable event and moves the head to a previously
active revision. Router rollback tokens restore the exact prior head, including
absence for a first activation. The rollback operation fingerprint depends only
on immutable router input, and the lifecycle function checks an existing event
before inspecting the mutable head, so retry after an authority/receipt crash
gap returns the original result even after the head was deleted or advanced by
that operation. No history row is edited or deleted.

The API below `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/company-profile` exposes current and
historical revisions, one revision, deterministic JSON diff, direct-admin
update-and-activate, proposal activation, rollback, and owner-only
`agent-policy` read/update. Purpose-built governance clients may use this API
directly; the simplified organization settings entry uses the policy-governed
agent administration path below. List responses contain a separate bounded `activeRevision`
lookup in addition to the bounded newest-revision page, so more than 50 newer
proposals cannot hide the effective profile or initialize the editor from an
empty value.

## Durable-learning adapter compatibility contract

The authority-native adapter retains the original organization-scope subjects
so historical receipts, rollbacks, and rolling clients remain valid:

| Router subject       | Authority operation                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `company_identity`   | replace `identity`                                                                                                                                   |
| `company_mission`    | replace `mission`                                                                                                                                    |
| `company_product`    | legacy stable-key upsert in `products`; a nonempty active historical value remains labeled compatibility prompt context until profile replacement    |
| `company_customer`   | legacy stable-key upsert in `customers`; a nonempty active historical value remains labeled compatibility prompt context until profile replacement   |
| `company_goal`       | legacy stable-key upsert in `goals`; a nonempty active historical value remains labeled compatibility prompt context until profile replacement       |
| `company_constraint` | legacy stable-key upsert in `constraints`; a nonempty active historical value remains labeled compatibility prompt context until profile replacement |

Repeatable list subjects require a valid stable key and fail closed without one.
New learning decisions must route those facts to organization-scoped knowledge;
this adapter compatibility is not permission to create new standing fields.
`createCompanyProfileDurableLearningAdapter` is the concrete structural adapter
installed under canonical durable-learning router's `authorities.company_profile` port. It accepts the
router's attempt/request/decision envelope, requires the resolved organization
scope and company-profile destination, maps the router attempt id to the
authority operation id, and delegates only to `writeCompanyProfileLearning` or
`rollbackCompanyProfileLearning`. It neither imports nor implements the router,
attempt ledger, or workspace learning-policy resolver.

`authority=proposal` appends an inactive proposal revision and never changes the
head. `authority=active` appends and activates one compatibility-profile revision, returns
`effectiveBoundary=next_accepted_attempt`, and returns an opaque rollback token.
The operation identity is the router attempt id, so exact router retry converges
without duplicate profile state. The router remains responsible for attempt-ledger
receipts and public `AUTHORITY_WRITE_FAILED` translation.

## Agent proposals, review, and automatic activation

The first-party `company_profile_propose` and `company_profile_confirm` tools
(`apps/api/src/mcp/company-profile-agent-admin.ts`) are the agent-facing path the
Organization settings → Organization identity "Create with OpenGeni" prompt directs a session to. They register
only for exact worker-signed agent attempts with `workspace:read` plus
`sessions:control`. Proposal input contains only identity and mission; the
canonical compatibility lists are written empty before the exact profile is
hashed. The result depends on the organization policy frozen at proposal time:
`off` creates nothing, `suggest` appends one inactive revision and returns the
exact structured-human-input payload, and `automatic` appends the proposal and
activates it through the existing lifecycle before returning `status=activated`.

Proposal input is validated against `AgentAuthoredCompanyProfileContent` rather
than `CompanyProfileContent`, so the agent bounds in "Bounded structured content"
above apply here and not on the manual `account:admin` route. The tool
description states those scalar bounds and the authoring style, because a model
left to itself writes an essay into a field that is then prepended to every root
prompt in the organization: one concise descriptive statement per field, no
numbered procedure and no marketing copy. The style clause used for workspace
rules is deliberately not reused here; a profile is descriptive, not an
instruction, so "write one imperative rule" would be the wrong shape.

For `suggest`, the returned question's `helpText` binds the revision number and
content SHA-256 and renders a readable summary of the proposed identity and
mission (bounded to the human-input contract), never raw JSON. Migration `0360`
narrows new confirmation copy while preserving immutable prompts on older
proposals; during a rolling deploy it still discloses any nonempty legacy lists
submitted by an older API instance before the human can activate them.

In `suggest`, only `company_profile_confirm`, after the initiating owner
answered the bound question with `activate`, can move the head. It revalidates
the live attempt, current organization role, proposal receipt/hash, human-input
request, and active-head compare-and-swap baseline. In `automatic`, `propose`
returns the completed mutation and the agent must report the applied change
without asking for another confirmation. The simplified organization Knowledge
section exposes the three organization-wide modes to owners but intentionally
does not expose revision lists or proposal lifecycle controls; those remain
available through the canonical API for authorized governance clients. The
earlier proposal-only `company_profile_propose` tool
(`durable_learning` provenance, `agent-attempt:<attemptId>` source id) and its
`proposeCompanyProfile` helper are retired; this propose/confirm path fully
supersedes them.

## Exact-attempt prompt delivery and precedence

Every accepted execution attempt creates or replays one immutable
`company_profile_snapshots` row. PostgreSQL validates the exact active
session/turn/attempt/generation and resolves the last activation event at or
before the logical turn's immutable `created_at`. A later activation cannot move
an already accepted turn; same-turn recovery resolves the same snapshot.

The existing workspace-governance composer is the sole prompt authority. When a
profile is active, the bounded deterministic order after non-bypassable platform
CORE is:

1. organization identity and mission, plus explicitly labeled nonempty legacy
   details retained by an older active revision until replacement;
2. organization preference descriptors;
3. workspace charter;
4. workspace global policy;
5. workspace preference descriptors;
6. immutable initiating-user preference descriptors;
7. matching session role policy;
8. durable session instructions;
9. selected tool/repository substrate;
10. bounded Memory/knowledge retrieval.

Per-message `modelContext` is outside this authority block. It enters only as ordinary chronological user-role content attached to its accepted message and cannot modify company-profile authority or the persistent instruction prefix.

The rendered company-profile slice fails closed above 32,768 UTF-8 bytes, and
the existing complete governance block retains its 131,072-byte fail-closed
ceiling. Snapshot/revision hashes and activation evidence are prompt-visible;
raw operation ids, actor identities, source ids, Documents, Memory, and
preference full content are not.

When an active revision contains only historical list fields, its compatibility
section remains present until replacement. When all six fields are empty, the
section is absent. Migration `0201` performs no backfill and creates no default
profile.

## Deliberate non-goals

This authority does not implement natural-language remember commands,
learning-policy resolution, Documents ingestion/search, automatic derivation of
organization knowledge, Memory, Skills, workspace-instruction activation, or a
generic company knowledge explorer. Organization Documents own that larger
retrieval surface.
