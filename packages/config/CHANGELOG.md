## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- aad6598: Claude subscription setup and replacement require only the setup token. Observe
  provider usage and reset windows from ordinary model responses, including quota
  errors, and expose scoped cached reads and authorized refreshes. Preserve the last
  reading when inference-only tokens cannot use the separate usage endpoint; fence
  cached readings against credential replacement and revocation.
- b591ea1: Support native Claude Messages with separate encrypted Anthropic API-key and Claude subscription setup-token connections, workspace access policies, streaming tools and thinking, prompt caching and usage accounting. Add connection UI and payment-source labels. Migration 0544 expands organization connection kinds and lifecycle validation.

  Pin the Claude subscription client identity headers, persist account/device metadata with encrypted credentials, and add request-scoped attribution. Existing token-only connections require replacement with identity metadata. The captured billing checksum remains unverified and is not replayed.

  Preserve Claude session identity across worker turns and recovery while keeping prompt lineage scoped to each run.

  Admit organization Claude models through session creation and lock their correct connection kind. Preserve Claude provider labels in the client catalog. Project initial system/developer instructions into Anthropic’s top-level system field so full agent sessions with skill instructions execute successfully.

  Polish Claude setup with local settings import, full-page token renewal, named model choices, provider marks, accurate subscription payment labels, and workspace discovery of organization-owned connections.

  Support workspace-owned Claude credentials, model generations, access controls and setup/account screens alongside organization connections. Migration 0545 expands workspace custom-model provider kinds. Gate Claude subscriptions behind OPENGENI_CLAUDE_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED (default off), leaving Anthropic API keys and other providers unchanged.

- 126a395: Make agent effort proportional to the request. The operational contract now asks for a direct answer with minimal tool use on simple asks, reuse of the earlier approach on repeat asks, one-sentence progress updates without a forced opening update, answer-first final responses, answers from web or published sources that are short but not partial (the best-supported finding, figures in the user's terms, and a source link beside each study or figure), and reading each Skill once without announcing it. A question asked mid-run gets an answer instead of restarting work; while work is still in flight the agent answers in one or two sentences in the user's terms, naming a blocker only when the user must act on it, and registers the wait again with the earlier reason and remaining time, even with an active goal, so its result still resumes the agent without pushing back a timed recheck, and a question alone no longer resumes a paused goal. Answers stay in chat by default; a document Artifact is created only when the user asks for one or the deliverable is large or meant to be kept or shared, and a session no longer creates a goal only to declare a document. The default persona is a general assistant; it works on a branch with a pull request only when the repository has a remote and git provider credentials, and otherwise leaves changes in the working tree without branch or pull request talk unless the user asks, saying only that the changes are not pushed when the repository has a remote, and the Sites and visualize Skill descriptors apply when the user asks or clearly benefits.
- 2088678: Support an optional exact email allowlist for native human account admission.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 585f2c1: Add an operator-disabled ephemeral Chromium BrowserSession mode for disposable sandbox verification. Explicit requests use isolated browser contexts within a trusted actor and placement partition, preserve existing private-profile defaults, and become terminal after shared process loss instead of silently recreating or replaying work.

### Patch Changes

- 74e0dfb: Refresh the default Modal desktop image to the verified publication supporting
  viewport actions and focused DOM reads. Report exact legacy controller schema
  and route mismatches as unsupported controller features without replaying browser
  actions or restarting live sessions.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- f48191e: Key managed sign-in, sign-up, verification, and password-reset rate limits, the address recorded on auth sessions, and every other API abuse quota on one trusted request source address, with IPv6 clients keyed on their /64. Managed auth adds explicit per-client-address limits and two-tier per-email throttles (per email and address, then per email), the browser session-set sign-in returns `Retry-After` on a per-email refusal, and the managed-auth database pool keeps serving when the server closes its connections instead of crashing the API.

  Breaking: `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (optionally narrowed by `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`) replaces `OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` and `Settings.mcpOauthTrustedProxyHops` is now `Settings.apiTrustedProxyHops`. API startup and runtime-artifact generation fail while the old variable is set to anything but `0`; rename it. Managed deployments behind a proxy must now set `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`: Better Auth previously read a single-value `X-Forwarded-For` by default and now ignores forwarding headers unless the hop count is declared, so without it every user shares the proxy's address and its sign-in and sign-up limits.

### Minor Changes

- b6d65a1: Add `OPENGENI_API_METRICS_PORT`. When it is set, the API serves `GET /metrics` only on that dedicated internal listener and never on the public API port, so an ingress that forwards every path to the API cannot publish Prometheus metrics. The listener applies the same deployment-key rules as before. Leaving it unset keeps the existing single-port behavior. The Helm chart now sets it by default (`api.metricsPort: 9464`). Upgrade note: on a cluster that enforces NetworkPolicy, only the bundled collector and `networkPolicy.monitoring` reach that port, so set `networkPolicy.monitoring` for any other Prometheus that scrapes the API. Managed-auth email verification now signs the user in on the first successful link click in the default `legacy` session-set mode, and every verification email tells a recipient who did not sign up to ignore it.
- 1a427e0: Add the optional Jev-backed `code_search` agent tool. It finds where something is implemented, configured or decided in the workspace in one call and returns verbatim, line-numbered passages with a coverage status. It is controlled by `OPENGENI_CODE_SEARCH_MODE` (`off` by default, `opt_in`, `default_on`, or `experiment` for a fixed per-session half), the `OPENGENI_JEV_*` settings, and a per-workspace `codeSearchEnabled` setting (`null` follows the deployment). Each session freezes its decision when it is created (`sessions.code_search_enabled`, rolling migration 0520, exposed as `codeSearchEnabled` on the session), and children keep their parent's, so later setting changes never add the tool to a running session's cached prompt; only the deployment switch-off and a workspace Off, and undoing them, reach running sessions. Each call records Jev usage per workspace. The Jev key stays on the server (API and worker processes) and never reaches a sandbox or Connected Machine, which only run allowlisted read-only ripgrep and file reads. Windows Connected Machines do not get the tool. `tool_search` now lists every tool the query names exactly before BM25 results.
- d582db0: Guard the unauthenticated local development API against browser attacks. In `local` access mode with `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT=local`, the API now answers only requests whose `Host` names this computer, which blocks DNS rebinding: loopback and the hosts of `OPENGENI_WEB_BASE_URL`, `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENGENI_GITHUB_APP_MANIFEST_BASE_URL`, and the new `OPENGENI_LOCAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for browsers, plus sandbox-only names (`host.docker.internal` with the Docker sandbox, and the hosts of `OPENGENI_MCP_URL` and `OPENGENI_MCP_INTERNAL_URL`) that serve only the Codemode, first-party MCP, and Git broker routes and refuse browser requests. Refused requests are logged once per distinct `Host` or `Origin`. Browser requests are accepted only from the configured web origin, the API's own address, or an exact origin listed in `OPENGENI_LOCAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; any other `Origin` gets 403, and local mode no longer answers with wildcard CORS. Requests without an `Origin` (the SDK, servers, sandbox callbacks) are unaffected. Managed and configured access modes, and local access mode under any other `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT`, are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 084616e: Advertise the product documentation the web console links from its Help menu.
  `ClientConfig` gains an optional `documentationUrl` field (an absolute http(s)
  URL, or `null` when the deployment hides the link) served by
  `/v1/config/client`, and `@opengeni/contracts` exports
  `DEFAULT_OPENGENI_DOCUMENTATION_URL`. Operators set it with the new
  `OPENGENI_DOCUMENTATION_URL` setting: unset means `https://docs.opengeni.ai`,
  `none` hides the link, and any other value fails startup. An absent
  field means a server that predates it, so clients show no link.
- 48a8774: Generate automatic session titles on chat-completions providers, such as OpenRouter connections, through one direct request outside the agent runner instead of a runner-only traced call that always failed. Routes without a resolved provider client now take the same direct path. The title request uses the model's lowest runnable reasoning effort and a larger output budget, a response stopped by the output limit keeps only whole words, and inline `<think>` reasoning before the answer is dropped. Automatic titles no longer keep a dangling closing quote or markdown mark from a wrapped title such as `"Pod Crash Debugging"` or `**Pod Crash Debugging**`. The managed OpenRouter free route (`isManagedOpenRouterFreeRoute`: the deployment-funded OpenRouter provider serving a `:free` variant) sends no title request, because it would spend the deployment key's shared per-minute and per-day request limits that users' turns need; those sessions keep the prompt preview until a turn on another route titles them.

### Patch Changes

- 31cf6ac: Preserve accepted Codex Astra turns across the implicit prompt-caching metadata
  rollout. Recover typed model-definition setup mismatches with bounded same-turn
  retries and truthful failure diagnostics, without changing accepted model authority
  or replaying completed external work.

- a11d810: Allow Codex catalog entries to retire from new selection while retaining exact already-accepted execution under unchanged live authorization checks.

### Patch Changes

- 793a6c9: Use the Codex subscription's 272K context limits for GPT-6 models instead of the direct API limits.
- ab3adb3: Allow provider-only database model catalogs with an explicit valid default and no dummy built-in models, preserving executable-default and retirement validation.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1bfb6a4: Remove Packs and their Workflow templates from the application, public clients,
  runtime, and active database schema. Plugins, Skills, Connections, sandbox
  environments, Knowledge, scheduled tasks, and event automations remain independent.

  PR Review now has its own setup authority and fixed automation template. Generic
  automation routes cannot mutate review-owned sources or triggers. The API contract
  revision changes; deploy matching server and client versions together.

  Migration 0482 is a destructive maintenance cutover: drain all API and worker
  database clients, settle Pack-related operations and queued Pack automation work,
  then apply migrations and provision roles before starting only matching binaries.
  It removes Pack data without a compatibility layer or data-preservation migration.
  Historical events mixing Pack and independent automation work block the cutover
  for explicit operator resolution; independent execution history is never silently deleted.
  Customized, shared, and re-scoped Skills, Connections, and session history are
  preserved; source-only Skills lose their active distribution owner.

- c66ba31: Unify interactive and trusted-backend OAuth setup on native workspace connections
  with optional canonical-user ownership, persisted lifecycle bindings, native
  credential refresh, and captured execution authority.

  Remove the superseded host binding, delegation, and credential-resolver API/SDK
  surfaces and runtime configuration. Migrate integrations to ordinary OAuth
  connections before upgrading; retired host selections are rejected rather than
  translated or silently replaced. Apply the matching database migrations and role
  provisioning with the runtime. Historical records remain preserved. See
  `docs/remote-mcp-credentials.md` for the cutover contract.

  Share connection setup, provider identity, loading states, conversation cards,
  composer, and activity surfaces between the console and React SDK. Preserve
  personal-account consent and native sharing authority, and keep interaction-only
  connection and command panels outside the initial session bundle.

### Patch Changes

- c702159: Stop retrying permanent runtime database posture and configuration failures as
  connection errors. Validate local startup prerequisites, prevent overlapping
  launchers from rotating live database credentials, and check database posture
  before building the development sandbox.
- 9d9b94b: Keep the published dependency closure aligned with the updated plugin removal
  contracts. The SDK exposes named removal outcomes and optional preview-token
  confirmation alongside the existing installation-version check.
- f90d628: Add durable native supervision for supported stock Modal non-PTY commands. Retain
  the idle invocation before provider dispatch and user-code release, verify native
  capability on the exact warm instance, persist descendant-quiescence proof
  before supervisor acknowledgment, and fence canonical settlement on provider exit
  plus captured output. Deadline cancellation keeps a monotonic stdin fence without
  cancelling ordinarily adopted background commands. Unsupported and legacy paths
  remain explicit and cannot manufacture supervision proof.
- a6251eb: Add isolated async trace context, parent/link export, bounded trace batching and
  retry health, and opt-in protected failure diagnostics independent of the
  application database. Preserve the public telemetry privacy projection.
- ac006ef: Add opt-in durable GPT-6 Astra reasoning effort updates with a stable request-level baseline, retry fencing, SDK replay, and explicit compaction restoration. Disabled by default pending live backend verification.
- c2b66d5: Parse artifact dispatcher and materializer settings independently from API and agent settings. Preserve database, telemetry, broker, and storage validation without requiring unrelated authentication or sandbox secrets in least-privilege sidecars.

### Patch Changes

- 50ac837: Add explicit accepted-turn host binding selection for shared conversations.

Document the supported empty-session then first-text admission flow.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e41027c: Add opt-in MCP operation outcome recovery through a configured read-only provider receipt tool. Persist exact operation identity before dispatch, retain original invocation outcomes separately from late receipts, and revalidate current authority across accepted attempts without replaying mutations. Preserve arbitrary SDK call IDs as correlation rather than replacing UUID operation identity.

  Apply the additive operation-ledger migration and runtime-role provisioning, and upgrade all claim-capable workers to the membership-first lock order before enabling provider mappings. Providers must implement the documented observation contract; unsupported providers and historical operations without captured authority are not automatically recoverable.

### Minor Changes

- cffd21b: Add organization-scoped external users, explicit native identity linking, shared
  white-label Connect flows and Site lifecycle/bridge surfaces. Add opt-in durable
  host-MCP delegation and renewal while preserving simple short-lived credentials,
  existing schedule authority and approval behavior. Share native/embedded device
  polling and setup components, and synchronize developer integration Skills with
  the installable Product Integration Pack.

  Database migrations 0437–0457 require the documented maintenance/cutover procedure;
  older API and worker writers must not be restarted after activation. Provider
  OAuth applications and host resolvers remain deployment configuration, not
  automatic external provisioning. No package is published by this changeset.

### Patch Changes

- 2fa33e4: Unify installed and authored workspace Skills behind one versioned text-folder
  store and shared editor. Derive names and descriptions from mandatory SKILL.md
  frontmatter, provide eager sandbox-free reading with exact requested paths, and
  expose lazy search, install, save, checkout, and publish tools under workspace
  Learning policy. Preserve workspace customizations on source updates and let
  embedding hosts narrow bundled guidance independently of lazy tool discovery.

  Migration 0433 is a maintenance cutover: drain old runtimes and use the
  parser-backed migration runner. Preserve historical snapshots and archive legacy
  configuration before conversion; invalid or pinned headerless configuration
  requires explicit repair before migration. See docs/skills-lifecycle.md for the
  deployment procedure and compatibility boundaries.

- ba890d1: Enable verified Low and Medium reasoning levels for the curated Nemotron 3 Super OpenRouter model, with Medium as its default.
- d8a70ec: Unify first-party and integration tools behind one workspace gateway for MCP, model execution, Codemode, SDK, and browser clients; require host-confirmed SDK approval for human-gated model calls, keep Codemode claims live through gateway preparation, and deduplicate reclaimed tool-created events; add opt-in resource-bound MCP OAuth; ship governed self-contained HTML Sites with retained source, version rollback, an exact-version direct-call tool allowlist, and a native Site-authoring Skill; and default Modal self-hosts to OpenGeni's public digest-pinned desktop runtime image.

- 9fe5c5b: Add organization-scoped Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter BYOK/custom models for shared workspaces while preserving independent workspace connections.

### Patch Changes

- c356468: Add explicit host authority provenance for opaque MCP connection references so embedding hosts can resolve any binding identity, including UUID values, without native delegation, catalog, attachment reauthorization, or reconnect flows reinterpreting it. Preserve the legacy non-UUID host-binding lane during rolling upgrades, retain host provenance after successful credential resolution, make auth-needed events inert in legacy browsers, and gate newly marked refs behind a default-off two-phase fleet activation.
- 5ef0757: Allow zero-holder sandbox drains to use a separate extended provider snapshot timeout without lengthening ordinary periodic or turn-end snapshot finalization, while keeping current and historical Modal rotation admission inside provider-deadline headroom and making opted-in lifecycle waiters honor an in-flight child's persisted bounded capture deadline across rolling configuration changes.

The legacy runtime desktop API remains exported only as a deprecated, fail-closed migration shell; because direct sandbox desktop control and model-bound tools are no longer functional, release `@opengeni/runtime` as the next major. Managed observations now carry bounded native image content for visual model input while preserving viewer control, explicit manual/on-verify recording, and historical contract parsing.

### Minor Changes

- dc6cfff: Turn per-channel and per-DM Slack workspace routing on by default, and stop counting a personal workspace as a routing choice in a channel.

  A personal workspace is now a candidate only in that person's own bot DM. It is the wrong destination for a channel - a shared thread routed into one member's private space is invisible to everyone else in the channel - and because managed tenancy provisions a personal workspace for every member, counting it meant nobody ever had exactly one candidate. That defeated the sole-candidate rule, so an organization with a single shared workspace would have been asked to choose in every channel despite having no choice to make.

  With that fixed, an organization with one shared workspace sees no change. For an organization with several, an unrouted channel asks the first person who uses it and remembers the answer, and a bot DM goes to that person's own personal workspace. Two things are worth knowing before upgrading: someone who has lost live organization authority in the routed workspace now receives a refusal in their bot DM where the previous code failed silently, and someone whose only workspace is their own personal one is now refused in a channel rather than having channel work land somewhere nobody else can see. Apply migrations through 0342 before running the new image. Set `OPENGENI_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ROUTING_ENABLED=false` to restore the short-circuit to the installation's own workspace.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 4be2055: Add `OPENGENI_CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_ENABLED` (default `false`): produce child lifecycle notices (`child_requires_action`, its resolution, `child_paused`, `child_waiting_capacity`, `child_progress`) for parent sessions. Rolling hazard: a worker from before these kinds existed throws on an unknown `session_system_updates` kind, so enable only once the whole fleet runs an image that understands them. The deployment contract carries it as a valueEnv passthrough (`CHILD_LIFECYCLE_NOTICES_PASSTHROUGH_ENV`).
  Once the flag has produced rows, a pre-notice image must never restart while any new-kind row is still pending in `session_system_updates` or `session_system_update_outbox`; turning the flag back off stops production but does not drain already committed rows.
- e6ffdc7: Add `OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MS` (comma-separated pacing delays before the n-th consecutive no-input goal continuation, default `3000,30000,120000,300000`) and `OPENGENI_GOAL_IDLE_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` (default `600000`), validated at boot. This is pacing, never a cap: any new input wakes the session immediately.

### Patch Changes

- a9cd9e7: Add the default-off first-party GitHub REST MCP bridge with separate workspace-App and personal-OAuth actors, exact accepted-repository authority, reviewed read/write tools, connector-policy defaults for writes, Codemode parity, bounded credential-free results, and no replay after ambiguous mutations.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- b2dd2f7: Bound the remaining request-scoped workspace control-row mutations and make the lock budget a first-class setting: `updateWorkspaceSettings`, `deleteSessionTreeIfQuiescent`, queue move/edit/delete, composer draft save, and the MCP agent message accept an optional `controlLockTimeoutMs` that API routes and core commands pass (lifecycle callers keep the unbounded wait), so a busy workspace yields the same typed retryable 503 `WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`. `OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` is now parsed and validated once at boot by `@opengeni/config` (`workspaceControlLockTimeoutMs`, positive integer ms, default 20000), installed into `@opengeni/db` by `createApp` through `configureWorkspaceControlRequestLockTimeoutMs`, and rendered by the deployment runtime-env generator as an optional passthrough.
- ab81e47: Allow the managed staging Slack app and bot to use the visibly distinct `OpenGeni Staging` identity. The manifest, runtime configuration, installation verification, durable binding contract, SDK, web projection, and deployment artifacts now preserve one closed environment-qualified display-name setting while production continues to default to `OpenGeni`.
- Updated dependencies [ab81e47]
  - @opengeni/contracts@2.1.1

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 650d6f9: Add an optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes sandbox backend with exact ID-addressed
  resume, renewable provider TTL, portable workspace archives, private server
  proxy support, pinned upstream deployment artifacts, and Azure sandbox-pool
  capacity isolation. Existing backend defaults, including Modal, remain
  unchanged unless `opensandbox` is selected explicitly.
- f7497fd: Add a disabled-by-default, user-owned personal GitHub OAuth lifecycle with
  separate deployment credentials, signed PKCE state, encrypted token custody,
  verified GitHub identity, typed SDK routes, reconnect fencing, and idempotent
  disconnect.

### Patch Changes

- 438e476: Add explicit anonymous OpenAI-compatible model providers with credential-free
  transport, external billing attribution, catalog readiness, and an External
  picker rail while preserving older client parsing by classifying the route from
  existing billing metadata instead of widening closed client enums. Anonymous
  providers reject all configured request headers and query parameters, and the
  runtime strips credential-like headers as a defense in depth. Document the
  temporary OpenCode Zen free-preview configuration.
  Generic Chat Completions routes also reject an `unknown` finish reason before
  accepting a terminal response, so the same accepted turn recovers from durable
  history without executing tools from ambiguous output.
- 3999dd5: Fail closed when Modal Computer/Browser is enabled without a digest-pinned desktop image, and classify a missing `opengeni-browserd-up` as unsupported instead of a retryable driver failure.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 4541ab2: Named pre-activation opt-out for canonical organization-tenancy authority: `OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_TENANCY_CANONICAL_ACTIVATION_ENABLED` (`organizationTenancyCanonicalActivationEnabled`) defaults to `false`, the reversible pre-activation posture, and is parsed with `EnvBoolean` so an explicit `false` cannot be coerced into activation. Leaving it unset or false is the supported way to decline or defer the one-way tenancy cutover; it is not a kill switch, and setting it back to false after an activation migration commits restores nothing. The chart's `config` map and `.env.example` pin the same safe default. The rollback boundary, activation preconditions, and operator procedure are documented in `docs/organization-tenancy.md` and `docs/deployment.md`.

- 91d5caf: Add a provider-neutral operational instruction contract for consistent agent collaboration, execution safety, file editing, and skill usage across every OpenGeni persona. Keep persistent system instructions prompt-cache stable, project goal continuations once as canonical user messages, let authoritative human input supersede a pending continuation, and remove the unreliable inferred-progress pause.
- 6c45ceb: Start fresh progressive-disclosure turns with only local tools, `tool_search`,
  and MCP servers explicitly marked eager by the session. Prepare every other
  strict or optional MCP concurrently, join the exact catalog only when searched
  or invoked, and keep worker first-party MCP traffic on an internal endpoint
  instead of a sandbox-facing public route while preserving the distinct root,
  documents, and files MCP paths.

Ship durable browser identities, authentication repair, network routing, downloads/uploads, shared causal control, public SDK and React workbench surfaces, and one exact MCP/Codemode execution catalog with native Connected Machine access.
- 5215c0e: Add the first-party Fiken connector: a registered-app OAuth flow (`startFikenOAuth` + public callback, Basic-auth code exchange, broker-owned refresh with rotating refresh tokens) and a verified paste-a-token install route, both storing one workspace-owned `fiken.no` connection; explicit-only `fiken_*` first-party MCP tools (reads plus contact-create and idempotent invoice-draft-create); a serialized single-concurrent-request Fiken client; an `api:fiken` capability tile whose connect sheet leads with OAuth and folds the token form behind a toggle; and operator config `OPENGENI_FIKEN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`.

### Patch Changes

- 87e9ae6: Add durable Google Drive Changes cursors, Shared Drive-aware delta draining,
  bounded full reconciliation, cursor-invalid repair, and a default-off
  Workspace Events wake seam. Normalize My Drive's root alias before ancestry
  checks and preserve cumulative item, provider-request, and elapsed budgets
  across delta, continuation, and full-repair checkpoints. Carry bounded
  per-object revision floors across delta-to-full and checkpointed full scans so
  older or equal Drive revisions cannot regress accepted metadata/current-version
  state, fail closed on conflicting fallback identities, and keep the first
  observation in one scan generation as a durable monotonic floor. Fence item
  version/metadata writes plus checkpoint and terminal cursor settlement to the
  exact lease, initiating subject, scan, checkpoint generation, and accepted
  floor, so a lost full-page checkpoint cannot replay version 8 as version 7.
- 8b6803a: Make Modal sandbox recovery command-ready and accurately diagnosed, use workspace-only snapshots for new sessions, enforce checkpoint cadence, and publish cached rig images only after an independent cold boot.

Agents and humans now share one artifact head through the same application authority; direct MCP and CodeMode support bounded inspection, fenced edits, trusted Office import, and asynchronous export to workspace files. The session UI gains a first-class Artifacts workspace, and React interaction viewers move to an explicit lazy-loadable subpath.

### Patch Changes

  DeepSeek V4 Flash and Kimi K3, including exact provider routing, cache-aware
  pricing and metering, Responses tool continuity, provider-blind catalog UX, and
  stable remote-compaction cache prefixes.
- Updated dependencies [9c4d73d]
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.31.1

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b3e46f: Allow a digest-pinned capability-pack sandbox image to bind an immutable Modal image ID. OpenGeni now preserves the logical OCI digest on the lease, starts the provider-native image through `ModalImageSelector.fromId`, records the actual ID in the Modal session envelope, clears lower-precedence IDs when a rig overrides the image, and keeps catalog image metadata aligned with the runtime manifest.

### Minor Changes

- ec0bc02: Add an opt-in browser analytics runtime contract with consent-gated, allowlisted
  Reo, PostHog, and GA4 provider configuration. Self-hosted deployments remain
  disabled by default, and public client configuration exposes no provider
  administrative credentials. Third-party modules load lazily, Reo clipboard/AI
  capture is disabled, query-bearing routes are excluded, and consent can be
  withdrawn without destabilizing the console.
- 5a4c559: Add first-party X and Reddit social connectors: OAuth connect flows (X PKCE
  S256, Reddit permanent grant) with encrypted token storage and just-in-time
  refresh, live first-party MCP tools (search, mentions, thread fetch, own-post
  sync, permission-gated reply publishing), a reddit provider in the marketing
  pack, operator config via OPENGENI_SOCIAL_OAUTH_CLIENTS_JSON, and SDK
  startSocialOAuth/listSocialConnections.

### Minor Changes

- Add declarative voice-input provider registry settings (`OPENGENI_VOICE_INPUT_*`) and
  `resolveVoiceInputProviderRegistry` / `voiceInputDeploymentConfigured` helpers for
  OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and experimental Codex transcription.
- Ignore template placeholder STT secrets (`your-key`, etc.) and prefer Codex
  subscription STT by default when `OPENGENI_CODEX_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED` is on
  (provider order `codex-subscription,openai,azure-openai`), even if OpenAI/Azure
  keys exist. Omit `codex-subscription` from the order to keep subscription turns
  without Codex voice.

## 0.7.19

### Patch Changes

- b7df541: Prevent provider-native checkpoint capture from racing sandbox operations while
  the provider has paused the source box. Capture now owns a durable
  lease/epoch/instance/generation claim, blocks new holders and mutations, drains
  provider-local reads before entering the exclusive snapshot call, and retains
  ownership through late provider settlement and exact stale-claim recovery.
  Modal's typed completed-exec stdin race is also normalized into a side-effect-free
  terminal poll, so an exec that exits between local lookup and the provider write
  settles its retained process instead of failing the enclosing turn.

## 0.7.15

### Patch Changes

- a19971e: Treat native provider snapshot receipts as typed opaque artifacts instead of tar
  trees; track every Modal Image in a provider-bound, crash-safe checkpoint ledger;
  garbage-collect displaced and publication-losing Images; adopt only provable
  legacy ownership; bind retained processes to their exact Modal namespace and
  reconcile historical terminal boxes without touching successors; rotate finite
  Modal boxes through the canonical checkpoint/drain/rematerialization path before
  their persisted deadline without checkpointing across an active direct API
  mutation; memoize terminal recovery failures; and use Modal's
  documented 24-hour maximum as the default hard box lifetime. Frame confined
  filesystem/Git command output at both boundaries with a fresh attempt nonce and
  strict exit-status parsing so provider diagnostics, truncation, or delayed
  retries cannot corrupt Modal-like `execCommand` control records. Upgrade the
  Modal JavaScript SDK to 0.9.0 and explicitly retain native checkpoint Images
  until the provider-bound artifact ledger proves that their exact ids are safe
  to garbage-collect.

  raw protocol JSON.

- Updated dependencies [744a93d]
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.18.1

## 0.6.9

### Patch Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.
- Updated dependencies [d1dee7a]
  - @opengeni/contracts@0.17.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- 334b63f: Publish the dependency-free Toolspace CLI, consume its canonical source from stock sandbox images, and expose an exact deployment-pinned bootstrap hint so custom rigs and connected machines can install it without ever guessing `latest`.

### Patch Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 5529945: Support Temporal Cloud and secured external Temporal endpoints across every API
  and worker connection. API-key authentication enables TLS automatically, while
  optional server-auth TLS, SNI override, custom root CA, and paired mTLS
  certificate settings share one validated connection policy.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.
- 3e65c23: Keep deterministic Codex subscription sharding sticky through 99% usage and
  rotate only after actual exhaustion or a definitive provider refusal. Remove the
  configurable near-exhaustion cutoff so warning presentation cannot strand usable
  subscription allowance.

  paginated projection.

### Patch Changes

  - @opengeni/codex@0.2.3

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a0cb58f: Streaming exec to Connected Machines over the op-stream protocol (server half).
  When a runner advertises the `op_stream` capability (persisted from its connect
  Hello onto the enrollment) and `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_STREAM_ENABLED` is on
  (default off), selfhosted exec streams as sequenced, acked, credit-flowed
  frames: no reply-size wall (retention-bounded, typed on overflow), blip-proof
  collection (re-attach + replay, blake3-verified byte-exact), and idempotent
  starts keyed by a durable per-tool-call op id so a re-dispatched turn attaches
  to the already-running command instead of re-running it. The legacy monolithic
  exec remains the permanent fallback wire form. The events bus gains an
  op-stream subscribe/publish accessor on the same managed NATS connection.

### Patch Changes

- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- ec508d4: Proactive context compaction now actually fires on the codex-subscription path: codex models declare their real (empirically measured) context window instead of inheriting the 1.05M global default, and the default compaction trigger moves from 60% to 90% of the declared window — compact as late as possible now that the window base is honest, with the reactive compact-on-reject ladder absorbing any overshoot.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 726cf2c: Make Connected Machine (selfhosted) control ops resilient: bounded retry of pre-admission DRAINING backpressure (patient ~60s budget for exec, short ~5s for other ops) and of a single transient TIMEOUT (read-only idempotent ops only — a timed-out mutation is never re-issued), a separate exec deadline distinct from the short control timeout (new `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` / `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 2min/30s), and actionable, human-language error copy for over-limit payloads, capacity backpressure, and exec-deadline termination.
- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e7a243: Support PRIVATE-registry Modal sandbox images via `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`.

  The Agents-extension Modal backend resolves `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REF` (and any pack
  `sandboxImage` that overrides it) with `Image.fromRegistry(tag)` and no secret, so it could
  only pull PUBLIC images. New optional setting `modalImageRegistrySecret` (env
  `OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_SECRET`) names a Modal Secret holding `REGISTRY_USERNAME` +
  `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`; when set, the runtime resolves that Secret and pre-builds
  `fromRegistry(tag, secret)` ONCE per worker process (`ensureModalRegistryImage`, awaited in
  `createOpenGeniWorker` boot) and the Modal provider selects it via
  `ModalImageSelector.fromImage(...)`. When unset the behavior is byte-identical to today's
  public-image path (and the modal SDK is never loaded for it). Resume/attach turns never pull
  the image, so they are unaffected.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

  The release pipeline now builds every publishable package, rewrites every published `workspace:*` dependency to a concrete semver range, rewrites source entry points to dist entry points for every publishable package, and leaves only leaf-only non-runtime packages ignored.
