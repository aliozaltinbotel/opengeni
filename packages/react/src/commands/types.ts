/**
 * The slash-command registry. A command is a SESSION / OPERATOR control — an
 * action on the session or the UI (clear, compact, pause the goal, show help) —
 * NOT a structured way to talk to the agent. The human↔agent channel stays
 * plain chat; the palette only recognizes a leading "/" and never sends a
 * command to the model.
 *
 * Two kinds, modeled by where the handler does its work:
 *  - CLIENT commands touch only the local UI (e.g. /help, /clear-view).
 *  - SERVER commands call the API through the SDK (e.g. /clear, /compact,
 *    /goal).
 * Both are just `run(args, ctx)`; `ctx` exposes the client for server commands
 * and the UI affordances (notice, openHelp, clearView, confirm) for both.
