/**
 * Rewrite `workspace:` protocol specifiers in the PUBLISHABLE packages to
 * concrete semver ranges right before `changeset publish`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * In a bun-managed workspace there is no npm package-lock, so `changeset
 * publish` falls back to the plain `npm publish` tool. Unlike `bun publish` or
 * `pnpm publish`, that path does NOT strip the `workspace:` protocol: it copies
 * the dependency spec verbatim into the published tarball's package.json. The
 * result is e.g. `@opengeni/react` shipping `"@opengeni/sdk": "workspace:*"`,
 * which npm clients cannot resolve → the package is uninstallable.
 *
 * Bun launches Changesets, but Changesets keeps npm as the registry transport
 * because Bun cannot emit npm provenance. So we have to do the rewrite
 * ourselves: replace each
 * `workspace:*` / `workspace:^x` / `workspace:~x` / `workspace:1.2.3` in the
 * publishable packages' published dependency maps (dependencies,
 * peerDependencies, optionalDependencies) with a concrete range resolved from
 * the depended workspace package's CURRENT version. The release path also
 * passes `--strip-dev-dependencies` so published package.json files do not
 * advertise dev-only private/workspace dependencies.
 *
 * Translation rules (matching pnpm/bun behavior):
 *   workspace:*        -> <version>    (exact pin, the common case)
 *   workspace:^        -> ^<version>
 *   workspace:~        -> ~<version>
 *   workspace:^1.2.3   -> ^1.2.3       (explicit range kept as-is, prefix stripped)
 *   workspace:~1.2.3   -> ~1.2.3
 *   workspace:1.2.3    -> 1.2.3        (exact pin)
 *
 * Every published @opengeni package releases in lockstep at one shared
 * version, so `workspace:*` pins siblings exactly. An exact pin also keeps
 * range resolvers away from retired pre-reset 1.x versions (for example an old
 * `@opengeni/contracts@1.0.1`) that a caret range would admit.
 *
 * The depended version is read from the live workspace package.json, so this
 * MUST run AFTER `changeset version` has bumped versions (in CI) for the ranges
 * to point at the about-to-be-published versions.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT: a spec with no `workspace:` prefix is left untouched, so running
 * twice is a no-op. This script intentionally has no `--restore`: the concrete
 * range does not retain enough information to recover the exact original
 * workspace protocol, and guessing would corrupt intentional concrete peers.
 *
 * CI SAFETY: run this only in the ephemeral release checkout. Local validation
 * uses the exported pure transformer and packed-consumer tests, never mutation
 * plus a lossy reverse transform.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/rewrite-workspace-deps.ts            # rewrite -> concrete
 *   bun scripts/rewrite-workspace-deps.ts --strip-dev-dependencies
