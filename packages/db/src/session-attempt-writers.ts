/**
 * An exact turn request whose attempt lost its execution: closed
 * `lease_lost_recoverable` or `failed` (worker death, redispatch exhaustion,
 * credential-lease loss), its turn holder gone from the lease, never adopted as
 * a retained process, provider outcome still unknown. Nothing reliably settles
 * it: the owner can admit no more work, and the only physical writer it can
 * stand for is a command that may still be running on that exact box. It must
 * not pin the sandbox (drain, command containment, deadline rotation) or
 * refuse checkpoints forever.
 *
 * This does not prove the owning worker is dead. Safety comes from what the
 * callers do: a drain captures around the request only before terminating the
 * box, a warm capture only when it is a point-in-time image and then records
 * itself as having run around writers, and the request is rejected only in the
 * cold commit after the exact box was terminated or proven gone. A late
 * settlement by a still-running owner is then fenced. Pause, Steer and
 * cancellation closures keep their requests as writers because the replacement
 * attempt resumes the same box; the holder clause is defence in depth.
