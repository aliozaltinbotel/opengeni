# Subscription core: data model, architecture and migration (2026-10-07)

This record designs the shared subscription core that implements
[subscription-accounts.md](../subscription-accounts.md) for Codex, Claude and
SuperGrok. Current behaviour is documented in
[subscription-accounts-inventory.md](../subscription-accounts-inventory.md);
EP-, CA- and Part references point there. Revision 2 incorporates an
independent design review (summarised in [section 9](#9-review-changes)).

## 1. Decisions

1. **One provider-keyed table set.** Connections, scopes, settings, session
   bindings, leases, waiters, turn failures and quota live in one set of
   `subscription_*` tables keyed by `provider`. Adding a provider adds a value
   and an adapter, never tables, SQL functions or policies. The bespoke Codex
   tables and the per-provider factory tables are retired. The Claude tables
   are a one-time text clone of the xAI tables that already drifts (Part 4
   §4.4.1), and Codex differs in every concern, so a single set is the only
   shape where "every capability for every provider" is structural.
2. **Move once per provider; no dual write.** Before cutover the core runs in
   shadow on top of the legacy tables through a read-only adapter. Each
   provider then cuts over in one drained maintenance migration that moves its
   rows (secret included) into the new tables inside the owner-only RLS
   window. Legacy tables become read-only for forensics and are dropped
   later. This is the existing practice for one-way cutovers (0403, 0492,
   0598) and avoids two copies of a rotating refresh token.
3. **Existing ids are preserved**, so events, audit rows, video envelopes and
   recent history keep pointing at the same account.
4. **A pure policy package decides; SQL enforces authority.** Placement is a
   pure function in a new `@opengeni/subscriptions` package. Authorization
   (scope, people, personal ownership, private-session access) is enforced in
   SQL, so a policy bug can at worst pick a worse account, never a forbidden
   one. Effective settings are resolved by SQL for enforcement, and a parity
   test pins the TypeScript copy to it.
5. **The account belongs to the session.** One chat binding per session.
   Explicit choice lives only on the binding, never in frozen turn authority.
6. **Accepted work freezes only personal authority**, per provider. Shared
   eligibility is checked live.
7. **Spread is a deterministic hash** of the session id over eligible accounts
   (D-21). No cross-session lock is needed (SUB-SEL-05).
8. **Cross-provider failover requires portable compaction.** New sessions use
   portable compaction whenever a cross-provider fallback is in effect for
   their model; existing Codex remote-compaction sessions convert at their
   next compaction while Codex still has capacity, and until then fail over
   only within Codex (D-19, see §6.4).

## 2. Architecture

```
consumers: chat turns, schedules, children, compaction, transcription, realtime, media, tool gateway, billing
        |
@opengeni/subscriptions (pure)   contract types, effective settings, placement, failover order,
        |                         cache coldness, adapter interface, shared quota model
packages/db subscriptions repo    connect/disconnect, scopes, settings, placement + lease (one
        |                         transaction), binding, waiters, turn failures, quota; SQL authority
provider adapters                 codex (packages/codex), xai (packages/xai-subscription),
                                  claude (packages/runtime anthropic path), API-key connectors
```

### 2.1 Adapter interface (SUB-PROV-01, SUB-PROV-02, SUB-PROV-04)

| Member | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `provider`, `capabilities` | Stable id and flags: `autoRenews`, `resetCredits`, `modelEntitlements`, `realtime`, `fundsMedia`, `apps`, `remoteCompaction`, `quotaWindows`. |
| `signIn` | OAuth, device code or setup token; returns an encrypted secret plus identity (provider account id, email, plan). |
| `refresh` | Token refresh under the core's single per-connection lock; returns the new secret. The core increments `refresh_generation` on every refresh. |
| `transport` | Request-local authorization and wire normalization for one selected connection. |
| `decodeQuota` | Provider usage responses or headers to the shared quota model. |
| `entitledModels` | Models the connection's plan can serve, including provider-observed exclusions (Codex plan entitlement). |
| `classifyError` | Shared outcomes: `exhausted(resetAt?)`, `rate_limited(retryAfter?)`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `entitlement_missing(model)`, `overloaded`, `transient`, `fatal`. |
| `cacheFacts` | Exact TTL (Claude) or measured idle cut-off (Codex, SuperGrok). |
| `historyCompatibility` | Which provider-specific history items (encrypted reasoning, thinking signatures, provider tools) must be dropped from a request copy when another provider serves the session. |

API-key connectors implement `provider`, `capabilities`, `transport`,
`classifyError`, `cacheFacts`, `entitledModels` and `historyCompatibility`
with a static credential and no quota windows. They are stored as
connections with `kind = api_key` in the same table, which makes them
failover targets and gives non-agent consumers one way to obtain a model
credential. Moving the existing API-key connection tables is a separate,
later step.

### 2.2 Shared quota model

```
{ windows: [{ id, usedPercent | null, resetsAt | null, status: ok | warning | exhausted | unknown }],
  modelCooldowns: { [modelId]: resetsAt },
  exhaustedUntil, exhaustedKind: quota | rate_limit | null, revision,
  observedAt, observedRefreshGeneration, source: usage_endpoint | response_headers | refusal }
```

An observation is applied only if `observedRefreshGeneration` equals the
connection's current `refresh_generation`, so a stale refusal cannot
quarantine a renewed credential (this replaces `version` fencing, which does
not change on Claude refresh).

## 3. Data model

Every table is `ENABLE` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and keyed by
`account_id` (the organization).

### 3.1 `subscription_connections`

- Identity: `id` (preserved), `account_id`, `provider`, `kind`
  (`subscription` | `api_key`), `provider_account_id`, `account_email`,
  `label`, `plan_type`.
- Uniqueness: one row per (organization, provider, provider account, owner),
  where owner is the personal owner or "shared". Migration deduplicates rows
  that today differ only by workspace, keeping the healthiest row's id and
  recording the others as aliases (`subscription_connection_aliases`) so old
  references still resolve (one upstream quota must not look like N
  accounts).
- Secret: `credential_encrypted`, `credential_format`, `expires_at`,
  `last_refresh_at`, `refresh_generation`, `version` (metadata OCC). One lock
  per connection id serializes every refresh, in every consumer.
- Health and allocation: `status`, `last_error`, `allocator_enabled`,
  `allocator_version`, `excluded_models` (entitlement exclusions observed by
  the adapter; read by eligibility, SUB-ELIG-03), `allowed_model_ids`
  (administrator access policy).
- Ownership: `ownership` (`shared` | `personal`). Personal rows carry the
  generic `organization_user_resource_authorities` tuple
  (`owner_organization_membership_id`, authority id, generation) with the new
  resource kind `subscription_connection`, and are not bound to a workspace.
- Scope (shared rows): `scope_kind` (`organization` | `workspaces` |
  `people`) and `allow_personal_workspaces`; assignments in
  `subscription_connection_workspaces` and `subscription_connection_people`
  (people are organization memberships). Organization scope means every
  current and future workspace.
- Management: `managed_by_workspace_id` (delegated management). Delegated
  managers can reconnect, rename and toggle allocation; only organization
  administrators change scope, ownership, or delete (SUB-OWN-04).
  `connected_by_subject_id` is audit only.
- `provider_state` jsonb is adapter-owned (for example Codex reset-credit
  counts); core decisions never read it.

### 3.2 `subscription_connection_quota`

One row per connection with the shared quota model and placement statistics
(`selection_count`, `last_selected_at`).

### 3.3 Settings

- `subscription_settings`: one organization row (`workspace_id` NULL, every
  value set, `locked_settings`), optional workspace rows (NULL = inherit).
  Values:
  - `rotation` per provider: `primary_first` with `primary_connection_id`
    (foreign key, `ON DELETE SET NULL`; a missing primary means spread), or
    `spread`.
  - `providers` per provider: `use_organization_accounts` (bool) and
    `enabled` (bool), plus `inference_source` (`automatic` | `workspace` |
    `organization`). `inference_source` is the authoritative pool-source
    selector; `enabled = false` projects the legacy `disabled` mode. The older
    `use_organization_accounts` field remains a compatibility projection
    (`false` only for `workspace`) and is not sufficient by itself to express
    organization-only selection. These settings never mutate connection scope
    or the model allowlist (§5.2).
  - `cross_provider_failover`, `fallback_order` (per model).
  - `personal_connections_allowed`, `personal_fallback_allowed`.
  - `version`, `updated_by_subject_id`, `updated_at`.
- `subscription_person_preferences`: per organization membership,
  `personal_fallback_opt_in`.
- `subscription_effective_settings(account_id, workspace_id)` (SQL) is the
  enforcement source; the TypeScript `effectiveSettings` has a parity test.
  An organization overview reads the same function for every workspace
  (SUB-SET-05).

### 3.4 `subscription_session_bindings`

Primary key `(workspace_id, session_id)`: `provider`, `connection_id`,
`model_id`, `choice` (`automatic` | `explicit`), `only_this_model`,
`last_model_call_at`, `last_switch_reason`, `version`.

- `last_model_call_at` is written when each model call completes (finalization
  and mid-turn placement), not only at turn start, so a long turn is not
  mistaken for a cold cache.
- Child sessions and scheduled runs that create a new session start
  `automatic` (their prompt cache key is their own session id, so there is no
  warm cache to keep). Forks copy the binding as `automatic`.
- The binding is the chat binding only. Media funding and realtime place their
  own accounts per operation and never write it (fixes EP-N12).

### 3.5 `subscription_leases`

Primary key `(workspace_id, turn_id)`: `connection_id`, `provider`,
`holder_id`, `generation`, `leased_until`. Fencing as today
(SUB-LEASE-01..03). Revocation found at renewal does not abort the in-flight
request; it marks the lease for failover at the next model-call boundary.

### 3.6 `subscription_capacity_waiters` and `subscription_turn_failures`

- Waiters: one per session, provider neutral, with the union of today's
  fields including `policy_hash`, `reset_kind`, `refresh_attempt` and
  `resumed_update_id`, plus `wait_reason`. Compaction turns wait like any
  other turn.
- Turn failures: per (turn, connection) failure receipts with recovery
  evidence, generalising `unresolvedCodexCredentialFailures`, and a per-turn
  failover bound so a turn cannot bounce between accounts forever.

### 3.7 Accepted authority v2

`subscription_authority` jsonb, immutable once written, on `session_turns`,
`scheduled_tasks`, `scheduled_task_revision_authorities`,
`session_system_updates`, the outbox and `sessions.initial_*`:

```
{ version: 2, personal: [{ provider, ownerMembershipId, authorityGeneration }] }
```

- Only personal authority is frozen, per provider, because it is a human's
  authority. A v1 `user` snapshot for one provider maps to exactly that
  provider; the owner membership is derived from the exact initiating human,
  and its `authorityGeneration` is preserved from validated resource-authority
  evidence (not replaced with the membership's current `authorization_revision`).
  Shared eligibility is never frozen.
- Agent messages and Steer take the receiving session's value; non-human
  acceptance (API keys, operators, Slack, service schedules) freezes no
  personal authority (SUB-ACCESS-01).
- The inbox execution-context fence (0608) and scheduled admission (0275,
  0478) compare Codex against its v2 entry while continuing to compare Claude
  and xAI against their existing provider-specific v1 columns through M4/M6.
  M3 must not replace those deferred-provider comparisons with v2, which does
  not encode their legacy shared-pool scope or generation.
- Provider cutovers are additive and provider-scoped. M3 writes only the
  Codex entry in v2 on live accepted-work rows, including scheduled tasks,
  while preserving all existing v1 columns byte-for-byte. Claude and xAI
  continue using their current v1 readers until their own M4/M6 cutovers;
  neither M3 nor its matched release may remove or bypass those readers. A
  later provider cutover uses that provider's v1 snapshot as a compatibility
  authority for already-accepted work when its v2 entry is absent, preserving
  the exact legacy shared-pool scope as well as personal scope. It must not
  rewrite an already-written v2 snapshot or reconstruct old authority from
  current settings. Keep the provider's v1 reader until every live accepted
  turn, scheduled execution and causal continuation that depends on it is
  terminal or has an equivalent immutable, verified authority record; moving
  new callers alone is not sufficient.

### 3.8 Authorization and row-level security

- Shared connection rows are visible to administrators and to workspaces in
  scope; people scope is evaluated against the **session owner**, the person
  whose session spends the account.
- Personal rows are usable only for work whose session owner is the owner and
  whose accepted authority lists that provider and owner, in the owner's
  private sessions or Personal workspace. The check is a `SECURITY DEFINER`
  function that takes the session owner and the turn's human as explicit
  arguments and reads memberships through the existing per-transaction
  capability pattern (0234), never through an empty subject.
- Binding, lease, waiter and failure rows reference the session and inherit
  `session_visibility_isolation`. Core operations run with the acting turn's
  initiating human (`withSubscriptionPoolSessionAccess`, SUB-ACCESS-02..04).
  A non-human turn in an owned session runs as `service:subscription-core`
  with the verified session owner only for that exact session; it has no
  personal authority unless the immutable accepted authority and live resource
  fence both allow it. A genuinely ownerless session has no substitute human:
  M3 adds a narrowly scoped ownerless-session capability keyed to the exact
  account, workspace, session and turn, requiring `session.owner_subject_id`
  and `turn.initiating_human_subject_id` to remain NULL and the service actor
  to be `service:subscription-core`. It permits shared organization/workspace
  connections only. It cannot read or bind a personal connection, use
  person-scoped assignments, or acquire personal fallback; it is rechecked on
  placement, renewal, dispatch and waiter recovery. The existing non-null-owner
  capability remains unchanged for owned sessions.
- Membership removal (0263) learns the `subscription_connection` resource
  kind and revokes personal connections on leave (SUB-ACCESS-06).

## 4. Placement

One transaction per placement, following the canonical lock order:
workspace control, then session, turn and attempt, then the session binding
row (created with `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` before it is locked).
No provider call happens inside it.

1. Read effective settings (SQL).
2. If the binding is `explicit`, use that connection or wait
   (`pinned_account_unavailable`); a choice that can never serve the work
   waits as `pinned_account_ineligible` (D-24).
3. Candidate models: the preferred model, then the fallback order (same or
   other providers, the latter only if cross-provider failover is on), or
   only the preferred model when the session is "only this model"
   (SUB-FAIL-05); filtered by workspace restrictions,
   connection `allowed_model_ids`, entitlements and per-model cooldowns. A
   preferred model the workspace does not allow falls through to the allowed
   candidates, and the session waits only if none is allowed (D-17). A
   provider switched off for the workspace and a compaction provider lock
   restrict models the same way (D-26).
4. Keep the bound connection if it can still serve its model, the cache is
   warm, and no re-selection point applies (compaction completed, model
   changed, session became shared while on a personal account).
5. Otherwise, per candidate model: shared connections that can serve it,
   ordered by rotation (the primary first, regardless of whether its quota
   is known), then by known capacity before unknown, then by a deterministic
   hash of the session and connection ids (D-21, D-23); then, with personal
   fallback, the owner's personal connections for the same model; then the
   next model.
6. Nothing servable: arm the session waiter with the earliest known reset
   (D-22), explaining a compaction lock when it is what keeps a usable model
   away.

Mid-turn failover happens only between model calls: the turn records a new
execution-policy revision, re-runs the funding check (`ensureRunAllowed`)
for the new provider, drops provider-specific history items from the request
copy (`historyCompatibility`), and keeps completed tools and accounting.
Image and video operations key their idempotency on the turn and call, not
the credential, so a failover cannot spend twice (SUB-ACCT-02).

The reference model (`packages/subscriptions/src/reference-model.ts`)
implements this algorithm independently; conformance compares production
decisions with `checkDecision`.

## 5. Migration

### 5.1 Steps

| Step | Change | Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | `@opengeni/subscriptions` package, reference-model conformance, and a read-only legacy adapter that builds the placement world from today's tables. Shadow placement at turn start records a content-free comparison: eligible-account sets (security parity), `checkDecision` on the core's decision, would-switch rate, and the inputs the Codex fleet shadow omits. | rolling | none |
| M2 | New tables, functions and policies, empty. Generic membership-lifecycle kind. Per-organization, per-provider cutover switch stored in the database. | rolling | none |
| M3 | Codex cutover: drained maintenance migration moves Codex rows (dedupe, aliases, secrets, bindings, leases, live waiters with generation and wake revision, v2 authority backfill) inside the owner window with explicit account-context parity counts; every Codex consumer (chat, compaction, transcription, realtime, image, Apps, reset credits, usage routes) switches in the same release. Workflow activities keep their names and accept both waiter shapes. | maintenance | Codex on the core |
| M4 | SuperGrok, then Claude, the same way; synthetic pool subjects and per-provider SQL functions retired. | maintenance | per provider |
| M5 | Product features: scopes and people, personal connections for every provider, settings with overrides and the overview, cache-aware stickiness, cross-provider failover and portable-compaction defaults. API and UI, previewed before merge. | rolling | product |
| M6 | Drop legacy tables, columns, triggers and functions. | maintenance | none |

Each migration declares its `deployment-mode`, opens the owner-only
`NO FORCE` window around backfills (`check:migration-rls-backfills`),
budgets ledger-replaying tests at 180 000 ms, and registers at all three
release-schema contract sites.

One-way points: after a provider's cutover migration commits, older images
must not restart, and rollback is forward-only (a fix-forward release),
as for 0403, 0492 and 0598. Everything before M3 is reversible.

### 5.1.1 M3 implementation plan

This addendum is the implementation boundary for M3. It cuts over Codex only;
Claude and SuperGrok continue through their existing paths and retain the M1
shadow comparison. No web UI redesign or new visible control is in scope. The
existing Codex account/session surfaces must continue to work through the
compatibility projections and event aliases below.

#### Runtime and consumer entry points

Every Codex entry point in the inventory is assigned to the shared core. The
provider adapter owns only Codex wire requests, OAuth/token normalization,
usage/quota parsing, plan/entitlement observation, and typed refusal
classification; it does not choose accounts, write pins, lease credentials, or
refresh tokens outside the core's per-connection lock.

| Inventory entry points | M3 path |
| --- | --- |
| EP-T01–T05: turn claim/model policy, chat placement, credential materialization, leases and dispatch fencing | Keep the worker/activity boundary and call the provider-neutral placement/materialization API with provider `codex`, accepted personal-authority v2, current session owner, workspace policy, and the current attempt fence. One lease and generation-fenced connection refresh lock apply to Codex exactly as to other providers. Remove the Codex-only `codex-rotation.ts` selection call. |
| EP-T06–T08: failure settlement, finalization, usage and lease release | Convert Codex refusals to core failure receipts; let core eligibility/quarantine/failover/wait rules decide. Record usage/quota against the leased `connection_id`, release through the common lease API, and retain idempotent settlement fences. |
| EP-T09–T10: capacity wait/recovery and wakes | Store waiters in `subscription_capacity_waiters` with turn/attempt, lease generation, `wake_revision`, and reset metadata. Reconcile and signal via provider-neutral repository/outbox APIs. Preserve existing Codex outbox delivery guarantees and keep retry/peek bounded. |
| EP-T11–T15, EP-T18: accepted authority, goals, child agents, inbox updates, schedules, model listing | Codex core reads only its immutable v2 authority entry; the migration preserves Claude/xAI v1 snapshots and their current readers until M4/M6. Only personal authority is captured, shared eligibility stays live. Codex model readiness/listing calls the same core eligibility projection with explicit account context; it must not reintroduce a Codex live selector. |
| EP-T16 and EP-S18–S25: compaction, admission and availability | `portable` compaction uses ordinary candidate-provider eligibility and may fail over as core policy permits. Existing `remote_v2` sessions keep remote Codex compaction and their current model lock until a successful Codex compaction converts the session to portable; the lock is represented as a candidate-model/provider restriction, not a separate Codex placement branch. Compaction uses the same lease, accepted authority, wait/recovery and history-sanitization boundaries as a chat turn. New-session default behavior is unchanged in M3. |
| EP-T17, EP-N08–N10: image generation and operation ledger | Place each Codex image operation through the core under the turn's accepted authority, with a per-operation lease and turn/call idempotency key. Resume/reconcile the existing operation ledger without reissuing an uncertain upstream write. Media placement never mutates the chat binding. |
| EP-N01–N04: transcription service, Codex transcription and HTTP/resumable recording routes | Keep provider ordering and recording segment ledger semantics. Provider ordering selects the initial provider only; once a subscription provider operation is selected/attempted, a refusal or transport failure does not retry the same audio through another provider in M3, per D-09 and §6.5. The Codex adapter receives explicit request owner/workspace context and obtains an operation lease through core eligibility; remove active-pointer-only token loading. Subscription transcription remains non-chargeable. |
| EP-N05–N07 and EP-S17: realtime catalog/begin, Codex WebRTC broker, and realtime selection | Catalog readiness uses core eligibility. Each session realtime operation resolves the session's accepted owner context, places and leases a Codex connection via core, and serializes refresh on that connection. Keep current client protocol and HTTP error translation; realtime operations do not write the chat binding. |
| EP-N11–N14: video funding, credential selection, admission envelope and crash reconciliation | These paths currently have no Codex-specific video adapter; keep video owned by its existing provider adapter and preserve its operation ledger. Remove any Codex active-pointer or copied-token assumptions if shared funding or recovery touches Codex, and route any Codex-funded operation through the core lease and serialized refresh rather than adding a new Codex selector. |
| EP-N15–N17: Codex Apps gateway, turn-time Apps auth, designation and clear/off | Keep designation separate from chat placement, but resolve its connection/alias and load its secret through core authorization and serialized refresh; remove any effective-pool-only token gate. Preserve setup-card and turn behavior. Clearing Apps must remain valid regardless of source mode. |
| EP-N18: reset-credit prepare/redeem | Resolve the supplied legacy account id through aliases to a core connection and use the core secret/refresh lock and redemption ledger. Keep routes, payloads, HMAC confirmation and single-use fences, but use the §6.3 authority: same-origin managed browser human who is an organization administrator or that connection's delegated manager. The prior connecting-human/acting-person-agent rule is superseded; do not permit bearer, MCP/service, scheduled or agent-acting-as-person redemption. Do not route redemption through automatic placement. |
| EP-N19–N20: funding bypass and usage attribution | Replace the Codex live-account predicate with a core eligibility/funding result using explicit workspace, session owner, accepted authority, and model. Keep subscription-use billing bypass (no deployment-credit charge) but do not let a stale/static catalog flag bypass admission. Attribute accepted usage to the selected connection. |
| EP-N21–N27: usage/overview/refresh routes, quota refresh, readiness and scheduled/parent authority | Preserve route behavior through adapters over core projections and refresh APIs. Every batch refresh supplies explicit organization/workspace/provider/connection context and uses the per-connection refresh lock; usage reads may trigger existing bounded wake reconciliation but never select through legacy active pointers. Parent/schedule readiness uses causal owner and frozen personal authority, never viewer inference. |
| EP-N28 and M1 shadow | Keep shadow comparison enabled for Claude and SuperGrok legacy paths. Codex's old-vs-new selector shadow is removed when the old selector is deleted; retain provider-neutral core observability, content-free and attempt-fenced. |
| EP-S01–S07, EP-S09–S16, EP-S26: Codex workspace/organization connect, list/status/source, account mutations, usage, Apps, access policy, SDK | Keep current route paths, methods, payloads and response compatibility. Handlers become adapters over organization-owned core connections/settings and convert legacy account ids through aliases. Preserve source names (`automatic`, `workspace`, `organization`, `disabled`) as projections over effective provider settings. Retain current authorization except where the contract explicitly supersedes it: Apps designation and reset redemption use §6.3 authorities, and redemption is browser-only. Add typed SDK methods for existing raw organization Codex routes only as needed to preserve API parity; do not remove existing method names or response fields. |
| EP-S08, EP-S27, EP-S29, EP-S31: session projection/pin, React hook, account indicator, event/status compatibility | Back the existing Codex projection and pin endpoint with the session binding. Preserve selected/waiting projections and `codex.account.*`, `codex.capacity.*`, and `codex.credential.selected` events as aliases emitted from canonical subscription events; map old payloads and reason/status enums deterministically. No visible redesign is included. |
| EP-S28, EP-S30 and remaining Codex-only bypasses | Keep current web account, model, audience and `remote_v2` controls unchanged; API/SDK compatibility aliases feed them. Remove every Codex-specific route into selection/routing, including `codex-rotation.ts` and Codex-only capacity/recovery branches. Do not change UI; if compatibility requires visible behavior, stop before merging it and obtain product-owner review with a real-component preview. |

#### Operation leases, policy dedupe and bindings

The M2 `subscription_leases` row is turn-scoped and cannot stand in for an
operation lease: transcription may have no session/turn, realtime has a
session but no turn, and multiple image operations can overlap one chat turn.
Add a provider-neutral `subscription_operation_leases` table/API in the core
runtime PR, keyed by operation id (and attempt/generation), separate from the
chat-turn lease. Carry organization, workspace, operation kind, connection,
holder, generation and expiry, with optional session/turn references for
session-bound work. Renew, pre-dispatch assert, release and expiry recovery
must all fence on exact operation id and generation; a media lease never
replaces or renews the chat lease. Every operation uses the common
per-connection refresh lock. RLS and database guards authorize a bound
session/turn through the same session-owner and initiating-human capability
seams as chat. Sessionless transcription requires explicit workspace-grant
and initiating-human context and can use only shared connections whose scope
includes that workspace; personal connections require an eligible private or
Personal-workspace session and frozen owner authority. Verify concurrent image
calls do not contend on the chat lease and sessionless transcription cannot
borrow caller or creator authority.

When deduplicating, union scope assignments only after comparing each legacy
workspace row's exact model allowlist, allocator state and delegated manager.
Store differing values in the assignment-policy relation described after
§5.2; never union model allowlists or let one workspace's manager authorize
another. If a legacy value cannot be represented or its owner/scope is
ambiguous, abort the organization cutover before mutation and report a
content-free conflict class. Validate eligible-account/model decisions and
management principals for every assigned workspace before and after mapping.

Manual pins survive even when their account is unhealthy, paused, explicitly
disabled, or temporarily outside the current inference pool: preserve the
explicit target and make it wait under D-24, never fail over automatically.
The migration uses a narrowly scoped, owner-only backfill seam that is
unavailable to `opengeni_app`; it records the target reference but grants no
dispatch or lease authority. Runtime placement rechecks health, connection
scope, effective source, plan, model and accepted authority before every lease.
The migration test proves unhealthy and newly ineligible explicit pins survive
and then wait, while the restricted application role cannot use the backfill
seam.

#### Data move and cutover protocol

The M3 maintenance migration moves all organizations' Codex state in one
transactional, drained activation. The per-organization/provider switch is a
post-migration runtime gate, not permission to run old and new schemas or
writers concurrently.

1. Before deployment, take a consistent source inventory and publish counts by
   organization and legacy source table. Stop all API, control-worker, and
   turn-worker processes using the old Codex protocol; pass the complete old
   and new runtime-login list to the migration drain check. The migration
   refuses activation if any listed runtime writer remains. Preserve queued,
   waiting, checkpointed and scheduled work; drain processes, not logical work.
2. Under the migration transaction's owner-only RLS posture window, decrypt
   only through the existing codec-aware migration path and re-encrypt into
   `subscription_connections`. Deduplicate by organization, provider,
   provider-account identity and owner, choosing the healthiest canonical row
   deterministically. Keep its id where possible and write every merged legacy
   id to `subscription_connection_aliases`; fail on identity ambiguity rather
   than merge distinct owners. Reconcile per-workspace model allowlist,
   allocator and manager differences into assignment policy before dropping
   any duplicate row. Secrets are copied only inside the trusted
   codec boundary and never enter logs, counts, fixtures or diagnostics. Every
   refresh thereafter, including alias-based calls, serializes on the one
   canonical connection id.
3. Map health, plan/account metadata, labels, allocator eligibility, model
   access policy, `inference_pool` classification per assignment, quota/reset
   facts and provider-owned reset-credit state
   without turning unknown quota into exhaustion. Keep `connected_by` as audit
   metadata only. Map scope and workspace assignments per §5.2: workspace rows
   become workspace-scoped shared connections; Personal-workspace rows become
   the owner's personal connection and set that owner's personal-fallback
   preference and the effective workspace `personal_fallback_allowed = true`
   setting per §5.2; organization rows with a NULL allowlist become organization
   scope; non-NULL lists become the identical workspace set plus the existing
   Personal-workspace bit. `organization` mode disables local Codex inference
   through the setting but does not erase workspace scope or non-inference
   access such as an Apps designation; switching source later must restore the
   exact prior inference pool without rebuilding assignments. A canonical
   connection present in both legacy workspace and organization pools retains
   both assignment-policy memberships and one credential, quota and refresh
   lock.
4. Build settings from the effective legacy Codex source, using §5.2's exact
   `automatic`, `workspace`, `organization`, and `disabled` mappings. Map
   rotation only for the pool currently in effect: rotation off becomes
   `primary_first` (D-13) with the active legacy connection as primary;
   rotation on becomes `spread`. For `automatic`, preserve no explicit source
   override and admit every eligible workspace- and organization-classified
   shared connection. Where §5.2 gives a local account primary precedence,
   preserve that rotation/primary order for new work; an unavailable primary
   falls through to eligible organization connections before opted-in personal
   fallback. Explicit `workspace` and `organization` source values filter by
   their assignment classification. Keep the old `use_organization_accounts`
   field as a derived API/SDK projection only. Do not synthesize a workspace
   model allowlist or alter connection scope to emulate source selection.
5. Convert session pin and last-account columns into one
   `subscription_session_bindings` row. A manual pin is `explicit`; otherwise
   preserve the latest effective selected account as `automatic`. Resolve ids
   through aliases, derive the current model provider, and set
   `last_model_call_at` from the latest model-call fact; if no fact exists,
   preserve an unknown timestamp for core coldness semantics. Never bind to a
   deleted alias. Preserve an unhealthy/ineligible explicit target through the
   owner-only, non-dispatching backfill seam above; ordinary application writes
   remain subject to active-pool guards.
6. Move active leases with the same turn, holder and generation fence, mapping
   connection ids through aliases and preserving expiry. Move only the
   authoritative waiter per blocked turn/session, carrying generation,
   stable `waiter_id` (preserving the Codex UUID), `wake_revision`,
   `observed_wake_revision`, `next_check_at`, reset reason/time, retry state,
   blocked-turn generation and accepted-update link. Extend the M2 waiter row
   with these compatibility fields and a unique account-scoped waiter id before
   backfill; an activity whose history already contains the legacy waiter id
   must reconcile against the same id after activation.
   Collapse stale duplicate per-pool waiters deterministically and retain a
   bounded disposition diagnostic. Add the Codex entry to v2 accepted
   authority on live sessions, turns, scheduled-task authorities, system
   updates and outbox rows without changing deferred-provider v1 snapshots or
   existing v2 entries. For a legacy Codex `user` snapshot, derive the owner
   only from the exact owner-caused acceptance; preserve its frozen
   `authorityGeneration` only when the source resource authority is verified
   and still active, and transfer that generation to the canonical connection
   and its resource-authority row. Never substitute the current membership
   `authorization_revision` or mint new personal authority from current
   membership alone. If the source authority is revoked, stale, or cannot be
   tied unambiguously to the canonical owner/resource, backfill no personal
   authority for that accepted work; it may proceed only on currently eligible
   shared capacity. Ambiguous ownership aborts activation. Non-human acceptance
   gains no personal authority. Preserve any durable Codex source/credential-policy snapshot as
   secret-safe legacy decision provenance for recovery/audit and use it only to
   initialize the migrated binding or identify a pre-cutover in-flight lease.
   The snapshot is not new authority: `explicit_choice` exists only on the
   session binding; shared pool eligibility, source settings, model policy,
   health and entitlement are re-evaluated by the core before a new selection,
   lease renewal or dispatch. A transferred live lease may finish only the
   already-authorized in-flight provider call and cannot authorize its next
   call. Personal authority remains only in the immutable v2 authority value.
   Source changes, revocations and pin changes therefore take effect at the
   next core placement boundary without reviving the legacy selector. Also backfill Codex
   personal authority for live owner-caused accepted work whose account moves
   from a Personal workspace to a personal connection, only when the exact
   session owner, initiating human, organization membership and current
   authority generation are verified. Cover queued turns, live waits and
   causal continuations; exclude non-human acceptance and abort on uncertain
   ownership.
7. Before commit, validate explicit-account-context parity counts by
   organization and legacy source: source/target credential and secret
   readability, unique upstream identities, aliases, scope/assignments,
   per-workspace model allowlists, allocator eligibility and manager
   principals, effective mode/rotation, pins/bindings, Apps designations,
   leases, live waiter IDs/generations/revisions, and v2 authority coverage.
   Use migration-owner queries that actually see
   FORCE-RLS rows; zero-row backfill success is invalid. Any mismatch rolls
   back activation.
8. Declare `-- deployment-mode: maintenance`, open the documented `NO FORCE`
   window only around owner backfills and restore FORCE before commit. Allocate
   the then-next free ledger ordinal and use the repository renumber tool if
   the shared migration ledger has advanced. Register the migration at all
   three release-schema contract sites. No UI change is part of this migration.

After commit, start only cutover-aware binaries. Enable the Codex
organization/provider switch only after runtime-posture checks, explicit
connection-context parity, compatibility projections and workflow replay pass.
The switch may hold an organization on a core-disabled behavior only if the
new binary has an explicit safe maintenance response; it cannot route through
old Codex tables after migration. It supports staged activation and containment
among compatible new binaries, but does **not** make the release a rolling
per-organization old/new cutover. Switch-off must fail closed or use documented
core maintenance behavior, never resurrect the deleted decision path.

#### Workflow and public compatibility

Keep Temporal activity names, workflow signal names and arguments stable
wherever possible. Update activity implementations to peek both the new
provider-neutral waiter and legacy Codex waiter shape during replay; after
activation all new writes target the core. Preserve existing Codex signal
payload fields and add optional generation/wake-revision fields without
changing their meaning. The core waiter retains the legacy waiter UUID so a
workflow history that already recorded a pre-cutover `waiterId` can reconcile
against the migrated row; if an ID cannot be preserved, use a durable
organization/session/generation-fenced alias lookup, never a best-effort
session-only match. Preserve `next_check_at`, `observed_wake_revision` and
blocked-turn generation as well as the latest wake revision. Pin
`legacy-session-capacity-wait-history.json` in a
replay test against the new workflow/activity registry; assert it reaches the
same waiting, wake, resume and continue-as-new decisions without
nondeterminism. Also test the cutover seam where the legacy peek activity has
already completed before migration and its recorded activity arguments execute
in reconciliation afterward; history replay alone cannot prove that migrated
database state matches a recorded waiter id. Keep signal delivery outbox-backed
and idempotent across a crash between database wake and Temporal signal.

For `SUB-COMPAT-02`, keep all current Codex route paths, verbs, request fields,
response keys, status/error codes, SDK method names, exported types, React hook
names, session-indicator inputs and existing Codex event names. Translate
legacy IDs through aliases on reads and writes. Retain source values
`automatic|workspace|organization|disabled` and the legacy active-account,
usage, Apps, reset-credit and session-pin projections as adapters; canonical
internal writes use core ids and settings. Events are aliases of one committed
state transition, not separate truth. Never expose ciphertext, refresh
material or alias ownership details.

Compatibility is wire-shape compatibility, not preservation of superseded
authorization. In particular, Apps designation/clear uses the organization
administrator or that connection's delegated manager in any inference source
mode. Reset-credit prepare/redeem is a same-origin managed-browser action for
those same principals only; an acting-person agent, organization MCP call,
bearer, service, scheduled task or background agent is refused. Alias
resolution occurs before the same live management check, and the HMAC,
attempt/credit binding, provider idempotency and ambiguous-outcome recovery
remain unchanged. Add route tests for each allowed/denied principal through
both canonical and aliased IDs. Preserve the legacy permission checks on other
routes unless a separately specified contract requirement supersedes them.

#### One-way boundary and fix-forward

The migration commit is the one-way point: no pre-M3 API/worker binary may
start afterward, and no down migration or application rollback to legacy
Codex writers is allowed. Before activation, preflight, backups and the old
binary remain recoverable. After activation, recovery is forward-only: correct
the migration only if activation did not commit; otherwise ship a fix-forward
binary and, when needed, a narrowly scoped forward repair migration that is
idempotent, alias-aware and parity-checked. Keep affected organizations behind
the new-binary switch while repairing; do not copy rows back, drop aliases,
reset generations, clear live waiters, or re-enable `codex-rotation.ts`.
Preserve accepted prompts/checkpoints and let current workers resume them.
Deployment docs must give operators the stop/drain, runtime-role list, backup,
activation, post-start validation and fix-forward sequence.
The same implementation updates `codex-subscription-rotation.md` to a short
pointer to the shared subscription contract/design for superseded behavior,
and updates contract verification lines only for requirements covered by
passing production-path tests.

#### Focused implementation PR sequence

Keep the implementation reviewable in three dependent changesets: (1) the
provider-neutral production runtime repository, operation-lease support,
assignment-policy relation, effective `inference_source` resolver and generic
capacity wait/recovery/wake path on the new tables, with Codex still disabled
behind the switch; (2) the Codex adapter, every listed Codex consumer, compatibility
route/SDK/event projections and removal of the legacy Codex selector/branches;
(3) the drained maintenance migration, cutover switch activation semantics,
release-schema registration and deployment runbook. The migration and
consumer code ship as one matched release and are activated only after the
required drain. Retire legacy Codex executable paths in M3; retain old tables
only where needed for later provider cutovers or the planned M6 schema cleanup.

The PR1 runtime-store migration is also maintenance-mode, although it moves no
records and opens no `NO FORCE` window: the standalone runtime-posture contract
is exact, so an older binary rejects the newly added FORCE-RLS relations and
grants. Drain old API, control-worker, and turn-worker processes before applying
0645, then start only binaries that include its matching runtime-posture and
repository contract. The provider switch remains disabled; it cannot make this
schema change a per-organization rolling rollout. PR3 remains the separate
one-way Codex data-move and switch-activation maintenance cutover.

Do not merge a partial Codex caller cutover that can strand Codex on the
core-disabled path. Each
implementation PR follows the repository's complex-change process: two
independent reviews (authorization/RLS and correctness/compatibility), validated
findings fixed, exact-head re-review, full green CI, head-SHA recheck, then
protected merge. Rerun only failed jobs for verified transient failures.

#### Verification plan

- Run `bun install` first. Test Codex adapter conformance without network using
  scripted local upstreams for token materialization/refresh, usage/quota,
  streams, refusals, malformed responses, delays, connection loss, partial
  streams and entitlement failures. A network-denial guard must fail any
  unexpected socket access.
- Compare production placement to the independent reference model on generated
  worlds and Codex scenarios: explicit account context, source modes,
  organization-first eligibility, model restrictions, unknown/reset quota,
  cache warmth, failover bounds, explicit pins and remote-v2 lock/portable
  conversion.
- Test migration parity on real PostgreSQL with the restricted runtime role
  and a separate owner-migrated harness. Seed duplicate identities, encrypted
  secrets, aliases, all legacy modes/scopes, workspace policies, pins, leases,
  waiting generations/revisions, reset-credit state, and personal/shared
  accepted work. Assert exact source/target counts and explicit
  account-context authorization, FORCE-RLS visibility and rollback on
  ambiguous ownership or parity failure. Every ledger-replaying test declares
  a 180 000 ms budget.
- Stress simultaneous placement and serialized refresh for one canonical
  connection through canonical and aliased ids. Assert no oversubscription,
  duplicate refresh, stale-generation quarantine, duplicate redemption or
  double image charge. Cover concurrent pin/mode changes and wake-revision
  races; prove Claude/SuperGrok legacy rows remain untouched.
- Verify operation lease concurrency independently of turn leases: overlapping
  image operations, realtime with no turn, sessionless transcription, lease
  expiry/reclaim and crash-before/after dispatch. A stale generation must not
  release or authorize another operation; sessionless operations must not gain
  personal-account access without the exact supported owner/workspace context.
- Inject crashes before/after migration commit, after lease transfer, after
  waiter wake commit but before signal, and during API refresh/redemption.
  Verify restart/reconciliation is idempotent and never repeats an uncertain
  upstream mutation.
- Replay `legacy-session-capacity-wait-history.json`, plus signal-before-peek,
  peek-before-signal, continue-as-new, wake-outbox retry and alias-remapped
  waiter histories. Assert workflow activity and signal names/shapes remain
  compatible.
- Run RLS/authz tests as a restricted role across shared, private and Personal
  sessions, no-initiating-human/service work, delegated management, aliases,
  and organization boundaries. Add mutation checks for selection, secret
  loading, source mapping, waiter generations and verification claims. Mark a
  contract requirement verified only when a product-path test names and
  exercises it.
- Verify a deduplicated upstream identity with conflicting per-workspace model
  allowlists, allocator states and managers preserves the exact eligible
  model/account set and administration boundary. Verify Apps remains usable
  for a previously designated local connection while inference source is
  `organization`, and that switching back to `workspace`/`automatic` restores
  the same local candidate pool. Verify transcription provider ordering is
  initial selection only and that a selected subscription failure does not
  retry the same audio through another provider, for both one-shot and
  resumable recordings.
- Run repository static guards, focused package/API/worker tests, full CI and
  migration guards. For PostgreSQL tests use the documented disposable
  pgvector service at `127.0.0.1:61440` with real-DB flags; if absent, use the
  throwaway PostgreSQL 17 cluster procedure. Never use real Codex credentials
  or live upstream endpoints.

### 5.2 Legacy shape mapping

| Legacy | New |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace-scoped credential in a shared workspace | Shared connection scoped to that workspace, managed by it. |
| Workspace-scoped credential in a Personal workspace | Personal connection owned by that workspace's owner. Set the owner's `personal_fallback_opt_in` and the effective workspace `personal_fallback_allowed` override (D-18); otherwise opt-in alone cannot reach the fallback candidate. An explicit organization lock of `false` remains authoritative and is recorded as a non-parity disposition, never overridden. |
| Organization credential with `allowed_workspace_ids` / `allow_personal_workspaces` | Shared connection: `organization` scope when the list is NULL, otherwise `workspaces` scope with the same list. |
| User-scoped credential (xAI, Claude) | Remains on its existing provider-specific v1 path through M3; M4/M6 map it to a personal connection for the same membership and add that provider's v2 authority entry. |
| Codex `automatic` | No override. Where the workspace has local accounts, the workspace's Codex rotation becomes `primary_first` with its active local account as primary, or `spread` if its rotation was on, so local accounts keep taking new work. |
| Codex `workspace` | Workspace override `inference_source = workspace` and compatibility projection `use_organization_accounts = false` for Codex. |
| Codex `organization` | Workspace override `inference_source = organization` and compatibility projection `use_organization_accounts = true`. The workspace's local Codex connections are excluded from inference by the source filter, but retain their workspace scope for independent consumers such as an existing Codex Apps designation and can be selected again if the source changes. Only organization-classified accounts serve inference, as today. |
| Codex `disabled` | Workspace override `enabled = false` for Codex; the legacy source endpoint continues to project `disabled`. |
| Rotation rows | Only the rows for the pool currently in effect are mapped (organization row to organization settings, workspace rows to workspace overrides). Rotation off maps to `primary_first` (D-13). Personal-pool rotation rows have no equivalent and are dropped (documented). |
| Codex session pin/last columns; xAI/Claude pin rows | One chat binding per session: a manual pin becomes `explicit`; otherwise the most recent pin or last account becomes `automatic` with `last_model_call_at` from the latest model call. Several per-pool rows collapse to the one for the session's current model provider. |
| Leases, waiters | Moved with generation and wake revision; several per-pool waiters on one session collapse to the waiting one for the blocked turn. Ownerless-session waits carry the exact session capability and remain shared-only during recovery. |
| Codex Apps designation | `subscription_apps_designations (workspace_id, connection_id, version)`; any in-scope connection may be designated (§6.3). |

When duplicate workspace copies of one upstream account collapse to one
connection, connection-level policy alone may not preserve each source row's
model allowlist, allocator eligibility, delegated manager, or legacy inference
pool. M3 therefore adds an assignment-policy relation keyed by `(account_id,
connection_id, workspace_id, inference_pool)` with those exact legacy
per-workspace values; `inference_pool` is `workspace` or `organization`. This
is a multi-membership relation: one deduplicated connection may belong to both
legacy pools in one workspace, with source-specific policies preserved
separately. SQL and TypeScript effective settings resolve the same
`inference_source`; `automatic` admits both authorized shared pools, while
explicit `workspace` and `organization` select only that classified pool.
Within automatic shared candidates, effective rotation/primary preference
orders new work, and a primary that cannot serve falls through to another
eligible shared connection before any opted-in personal fallback. Personal
connections never become automatic shared-pool members. Management
authorization applies the matching assignment policy before connection-wide
defaults. This preserves SUB-OWN-08 uniqueness without unioning model
permissions or discarding a workspace's management boundary. Source mode
controls inference selection, not connection visibility or non-inference
consumers.

## 6. Specific behaviours

### 6.1 Cache coldness (SUB-STICK-04)

Claude: idle longer than the TTL Opengeni sent. Codex and SuperGrok: a
per-provider cut-off measured from `model_call_facts`, which gains
`connection_id` (also needed for SUB-ACCT-01). Until measured, the cut-off is
60 minutes: erring towards "warm" avoids paying a cache miss for a switch
that was not needed, at the cost of returning to the preferred account later.

### 6.2 Events (SUB-FAIL-06)

`subscription.account.switched { provider, fromConnectionId, toConnectionId,
fromModel, toModel, reason }` with reason in `initial`, `reselected_cold`,
`failover_same_provider`, `failover_cross_provider`, `return_to_preferred`,
`explicit_choice`, `revoked`; and `subscription.capacity.waiting { reason,
earliestResetAt }`. Existing Codex account-switch events remain as aliases
for current clients (SUB-COMPAT-02).

### 6.3 Codex Apps and reset credits (SUB-APPS-01, SUB-APPS-02)

Apps credentials load by their designation, never through placement. Any
organization administrator or the connection's delegated manager may
designate or clear Apps in any routing mode. Reset-credit redemption stays
human-only from a browser session, allowed to organization administrators
and delegated managers of that connection (not "whoever connected it").

### 6.4 Compaction (SUB-FAIL-09)

Remote compaction keeps only an opaque encrypted item plus retained user,
system and developer messages, so there is no cleartext to convert at
failover time. Therefore: new sessions whose model has an effective
cross-provider fallback start with portable compaction; existing
remote-compaction sessions convert at their next compaction while Codex has
capacity; until converted they fail over only within Codex and otherwise
wait with an explained reason.

### 6.5 Consumers outside chat (SUB-FAIL-10, SUB-CONS-01)

Transcription, realtime, image and video place an account per operation
through the same eligibility and authority rules, take a lease, and never
fail over across providers in the first release.

## 7. Verification

- Reference-model conformance on generated worlds and scripted scenarios.
- No-network provider conformance for each adapter (refresh, usage, streams,
  refusals, malformed data, delays, connection loss, partial streams,
  entitlement failures); unexpected network access fails the test.
- Migration tests on real PostgreSQL with the restricted role: per-provider
  parity with explicit account context, dedupe and aliases, live waiter
  carry-over, forward-only recovery.
- Workflow replay of existing capacity-wait histories across M3 and M4.
- SQL and TypeScript effective-settings/`inference_source` parity, including
  automatic admission of both shared pools, primary/local exhaustion falling
  through to organization capacity, workspace-only and organization-only
  filtering, disabled projection, and source transitions without changing
  Apps authorization. A Personal-workspace owner with a migrated personal
  connection must use healthy shared organization capacity before personal
  fallback; exercise the same upstream identity present in both legacy pools
  with different per-pool model policies.
- Snapshot migration tests prove legacy source/policy is retained as
  secret-safe provenance, manual explicit choice is represented only by the
  binding, and live shared eligibility/source/pin changes govern the next
  placement and dispatch after cutover.
- Compatibility tests prove M3 adds Codex v2 authority without changing xAI or
  Claude v1 snapshot bytes or breaking their existing accepted-authority
  readers or 0608/0275/0478 admission-fence comparisons. Ownerless service
  sessions can use shared connections but cannot observe or acquire personal
  connections. Personal-workspace fallback needs both the migrated owner
  opt-in and effective setting, with organization locks preserved.
  Resource-generation transfer preserves valid queued authority while a
  revoked/stale resource never regains personal access.
- The contract's mutation gate.

## 8. Risks

- Concurrent changes in this area: M1 and M2 change no behaviour and land
  first; each cutover is one provider at a time.
- Cutover migrations are maintenance-mode and one-way; they need drained
  workers and a tested forward-fix path.
- Dedupe of duplicated upstream accounts can change which account a session
  lands on; bindings are remapped through aliases.
