-- Lift every row still holding an exact older named Member set (pre-0516 or
-- post-0516, in any JSONB order) to the 0555 named set. External
-- (`external_user:`) memberships keep their caller-chosen set. The partial
-- index keeps candidate discovery and the empty completion probe bounded.
-- Each 500-row batch commits independently. A contended candidate fails
-- promptly instead of being skipped and incorrectly recorded as done.
-- workspace_memberships has no row-level security, so the migration owner
-- sees every candidate.
