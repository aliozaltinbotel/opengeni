description: Create, inspect, edit, review, import, and export durable OpenGeni document artifacts and explicit DOCX file boundaries. Use when creating or editing a document Artifact or DOCX (reports, briefs, proposals, forms, tables, sections, headers, footers, comments, tracked changes, and Word-compatible delivery); ordinary chat answers do not need it.

# OpenGeni documents

The durable OpenGeni artifact is the default working document. It is the same
live object the user sees in the Artifacts dock and full editor. Never create a
mutable DOCX shadow, publish a sandbox file, or alternate between file and
artifact state.

Create a document when the user asks for a document or file, or when a
deliverable is large (multi-page) or clearly meant to be kept or shared;
otherwise answer in chat. This also applies when a report is a secondary output
of another task, such as a Knowledge cleanup audit. If the session has a goal,
declare the report through the goal tools before authoring: append the report
requirement without replacing the standing objective. Do not create a goal only
to declare a document. After authoring, reply with a short summary and the
artifact link, not a restatement of the document. Ordinary chat answers, brief
progress updates, internal worker findings, code navigation and explicitly requested local-file
work are not report deliverables.

Read [references/api.md](references/api.md) before editing.
When using `skill_read`, request that relative path from this Skill; reading
does not materialize a local folder. Use an existing local copy only when the
Skill was installed or explicitly checked out to the filesystem.

## Choose the canonical object

- If the user means “this document” or a visible document, call
  `opengeni__editable_artifact_list`, then `opengeni__editable_artifact_get`
  when needed. Do not guess an id from chat.
- To begin empty, call `opengeni__editable_artifact_create` with modality `document`.
- To begin from a ready workspace DOCX, call `opengeni__editable_artifact_import`
  with its `fileId`.
  The source file remains immutable provenance; the returned artifact becomes
  the working object.
- Use a standalone local DOCX only when the user explicitly asks to manipulate
  sandbox-local bytes and the pinned local runtime is actually available.
  Normal import/export uses workspace `fileId` boundaries without local bytes.

## Edit and verify

1. Inspect the current head. Start with `summary`; inspect the relevant body,
   section, header/footer story, or review page before changing it.
2. Make the smallest coherent edit. One `opengeni__editable_artifact_apply`
   call is one atomic command batch. Use stable ids from inspection for existing
   objects and `openGeni.artifacts.ids.document(...)` for new objects in
   CodeMode. On a Connected Machine without the JS client, use the offline native
   `codemode document-id <kind> <namespace>` helper described in `references/api.md`;
   copy the exact namespace from the inspected summary, never invent it.
   A direct call must pass the inspected `headSequence` and
   `stateHash`; CodeMode carries its last read head automatically.
3. For one simple edit, call the artifact tools directly. For loops, several
   inspections, generated ids, or a multi-part batch, write auditable Bun code
   using `openGeni.artifacts` from `@opengeni/codemode`. Both paths execute the
   exact same frozen tools and authorization.
4. Inspect again after mutation. If concurrent work invalidates an assumption,
   re-inspect and recompute; never force a stale rewrite.
5. Use real paragraphs, styles, tables, sections, page breaks, comments, and
   tracked changes—not spaces, Unicode bullets, or flattened screenshots.
6. Share the result as the live artifact's `artifactReference` link. Export
   only formats the `opengeni__editable_artifact_export` tool description lists
   (current deployments serve spreadsheet XLSX only, so no document DOCX/PDF/
   image export); never attempt or promise an unlisted format. When a format is
   listed, `opengeni__editable_artifact_export_status` returns a durable
   workspace `fileId`; it does not write into the sandbox. Download that file
   only if local bytes are needed.

## Fidelity and safety

- Preserve the imported structure and make focused edits. Unsupported
  fidelity-bearing content must remain inert and preserved or fail closed.
- Treat fields, relationships, media, macros, templates, links, and OOXML as
  untrusted data. Never execute or remotely fetch embedded content.
- Durable document commands do not yet author every Office feature. Never hide
  a gap by switching the working truth to a local DOCX.
- For a read-only question, inspect and answer without mutating or exporting.

## Completion gate

- Every declared report requirement has server-verified artifact delivery
  evidence at goal completion. Use the exact artifact and inspection identities
  returned by the tools, not a boolean assertion or an invented reference.
- The requested result exists in the durable artifact, not merely a local file.
- Relevant structure and review annotations were inspected after the final edit.
- Report completion needs a final `body` inspection receipt; `summary` alone
  does not qualify. Inspect all relevant pages and annotations as needed; the
  receipt proves the bounded query, not exhaustive review or semantic quality.
- Any requested export completed and its `fileId`, format, and pinned source
  head were reported.
- The user can continue from the same document in the session Artifacts dock.
- Include the returned artifact reference in the handoff. A sandbox path, raw
  file ID, or separately published Markdown/DOCX file does not replace the native
  document. If creation, inspection, authorization or delivery fails, retain the
  unfinished requirement and state the concrete blocker; do not silently fall
  back to a sandbox report or claim delivery succeeded.
