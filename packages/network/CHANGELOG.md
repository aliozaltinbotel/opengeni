## 1.0.2

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Reset package versioning: every published `@opengeni/*` package now releases together at one shared version, starting at 1.0.0. Install all `@opengeni` packages at the same version. Earlier versions are retired.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 3cc26b5: Identify the default pinned HTTP client with a User-Agent, preserve caller overrides, and show retryable MCP sign-in discovery failures in connection setup.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 52cf486: Use protected-resource metadata prefix locations instead of guessing a metadata URL beneath the protected API route. Preserve explicitly advertised URLs and fail-closed metadata handling.
- 92cdc31: Follow the standard MCP authorization-server metadata discovery order so protected guessed routes cannot prevent discovery of valid OpenID metadata.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 876396d: Support safe same-origin legacy MCP OAuth discovery when RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata is absent, and expose shared runtime/catalog discovery classifications.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 16387c3: Keep ordinary MCP connections pinned to the complete vetted DNS answer under Bun and prefer IPv4 when a public dual-stack destination is available.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 2f4ce5e: Add durable Seedance video generation with workspace model and funding policy,
  secure media references, retained video artifacts, sandbox materialization,
  OpenGeni-credit and workspace-gateway funding, and SDK/React playback surfaces.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e2edfbc: Add provider-aware image generation with permanent verified artifacts,
  prompt-cache-safe history, sandbox materialization, and SDK/React rendering.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 664c1d8: Bound MCP OAuth setup with an absolute server deadline, abort stalled response streams, and preserve safe stage-specific API error details in SDK clients.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 4976e1c: Fix DNS-pinned OAuth response streaming under Bun and expose X as a built-in workspace social capability.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.
