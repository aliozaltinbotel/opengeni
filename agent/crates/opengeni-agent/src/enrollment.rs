//! Device-flow enrollment client (OAuth 2.0 device authorization, RFC 8628).
//!
//! This is the **single module that owns the enrollment HTTP wire shape** — the
//! reconciliation seam with the deployed M5 control-plane device-flow routes
//! (`apps/api/src/routes/enrollments.ts` + `apps/api/src/sandbox/enrollment.ts`).
//! The HTTP request/response structs ([`wire`]) are isolated here and match the
//! API's `@opengeni/contracts` Zod shapes EXACTLY: camelCase JSON keys, the
//! `/v1/...` paths, and the STRING poll-state enum the API returns. The structs
//! convert to/from the proto [`EnrollmentCredentials`](opengeni_agent_proto::v1::EnrollmentCredentials)
//! at their edges so the rest of the agent only ever sees proto types.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. The agent loads its durable ed25519 install keypair from disk, generating
//!    it only once when absent; the FULL public key (base64) is the `publicKey`
//!    the enrollment binds to (non-transferable).
//! 2. `POST /v1/enrollments/device/start` with `{ workspaceId, publicKey, os, arch,
//!    machineName?, canOfferDisplay, requestsScreenControl }` (camelCase) → a
//!    `userCode` + `verificationUri` the human visits to consent + authorize.
//! 3. The agent prints the code/URL and polls `POST /v1/enrollments/device/poll`
//!    with `{ deviceCode }` until the state is `authorized` (carrying
//!    [`EnrollmentCredentials`]), `denied`, `expired`, or `disabled`, honoring the
//!    server's poll interval (the API rate-limits via HTTP 429, not `slow_down`).
//! 4. The caller wraps the returned credentials in the deployment-aware local
//!    connection identity and persists them owner-only (see
//!    [`crate::config::save_connection`]).
