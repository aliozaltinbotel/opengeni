# AWS Reference Substrate

This root creates a cleanup-friendly AWS substrate for the Helm chart:

- EKS cluster and managed node group.
- ECR repositories scoped under `name_prefix` for API, worker, and web images.
- S3 bucket for `OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_BACKEND=aws-s3`.

Connected Machines (`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=selfhosted`) add one more deployed
component, the `opengeni-relay` stream relay. It is a separate image, so an
operator enabling Connected Machines must also provision a container repository
for it (this root creates the API/worker/web repositories only). The relay pairs
each channel's producer and consumer in a per-replica in-memory registry, so its
public wss ingress must route both dials for a channel to the same replica
(consistent-hash / session affinity keyed on the channel) whenever more than one
relay replica runs. See `docs/deployment.md` (Connected Machines) for the full
relay/NATS/secret wiring.
- AWS Secrets Manager runtime secret placeholder.
- Optional RDS PostgreSQL when `postgres.mode = "managed"`.
- `temporal.mode = "officialChart"` output wiring for the stack-wrapper managed upstream Temporal chart, or `external` for Temporal Cloud/customer endpoints.

Keep Opengeni workloads in the provider-neutral Helm chart. This root should only create cloud substrate and emit non-secret Helm values.

## Validate

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws fmt -check
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws validate
```

## Apply

Before creating resources, decide where the operator will keep exact resource
names, cleanup notes, and generated access material. Keep those records outside
the repository along with Terraform state, plans, kubeconfigs, and filled
tfvars.

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

For short-lived evaluation stacks, set `postgres.deletion_protection = false`
and `postgres.skip_final_snapshot = true` before apply. For production-like
stacks, keep final snapshots and deletion protection enabled.

Do not commit state, kubeconfigs, generated database passwords, AWS credentials, or filled secret values.
The official Temporal chart still needs durable Postgres databases prepared outside the Opengeni app chart before Helm install.
