# Deployment

## Scheduled Slack channel posts (0530)

`0530_scheduled_slack_bot_messages.sql` is rolling. It adds the private
`opengeni_private.scheduled_slack_bot_messages` table and its two runtime
capabilities; the public-schema table inventory of older processes is
unchanged. Run `db:provision-roles` after it as usual. Older API and worker
processes ignore the new `slackBotChannelId` task field, so a task keeps
running without the posting tools until the matching worker creates its next
run. See [`slack-bot.md`](slack-bot.md#scheduled-tasks).

## Assistant message phases (0527)

`0527_session_attention_excludes_commentary.sql` is rolling: it builds the
commentary-free attention index concurrently, and the 0503 index keeps serving
older API processes. The same predicate admits a `turn.completed` whose
`reply` records the answer a human's message received before its turn waited
for input. Workers from this release stream one
`agent.message.completed` per assistant message, including progress notes
(`phase: "commentary"`). Only API processes from the same release treat those as
activity. While an older API process still runs next to a newer worker, it can
post up to three progress notes per Slack interaction, wake `session_wait`
change mode on each note, and mark a session unread for a note. Roll the API
before the workers to avoid that window; nothing is stored wrongly either way.
Once no API image older than 0527 can run, a later rolling migration drops
`session_events_meaningful_attention_idx` (the 0503 index) and its schema entry.

## Verified signup trial runtime switch (0521)

`0521_verified_signup_trial_runtime_switch.sql` is a rolling migration. It needs
no drain and no `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`; migrate, then
run the normal `db:provision-roles`. Its seed revision allows grants, so this
migration changes no behavior on its own.

A new verified self-service setup gets the one-time $10 trial credit only when
**both** switches allow it:

- `OPENGENI_VERIFIED_SIGNUP_TRIAL_CREDITS_ENABLED` is the deployment master
  opt-in. The API reads it at startup, so changing it needs a config rollout
  and an API restart. Leave it `false` until the campaign is approved.
- The runtime switch is the newest row of the append-only
  `opengeni_private.verified_signup_trial_switch_revisions` table. Use it as
  the fast kill switch for abuse response. A change applies to the next setup
  transaction on every API replica, with no deploy or restart.

To pause or resume grants, connect as the migration owner (the role in
`OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL`) and call the audited setter:

```sql
select set_verified_signup_trial_credits_enabled(
  false,                                                        -- true resumes grants
  'github:<owner>/<repo>:actor:<actor>:run:<run id>:attempt:<n>', -- operator identity, 1-200 characters
  'abuse response: pause signup trial'                          -- reason, 6-1000 characters
);
```

Use the same `github:<owner>/<repo>:actor:<actor>:run:<run id>:attempt:<n>`
identity that an audited CI operator job records, so manual and automated
revisions read the same in the audit table.

It returns the new revision as JSON (`revision`, `grantsEnabled`,
`previousGrantsEnabled`, `changed`, `operator`, `reason`, `databaseRole`,
`changedAt`). Every call appends one revision, even when the value does not
change, and records the calling database login. Revisions cannot be updated,
deleted, or truncated. Run it from an audited, access-controlled operator job
(for example, a protected CI environment that already holds the migration
credentials), never from an application pod. Read the current state with:

```sql
select revision, grants_enabled, previous_grants_enabled, operator, reason,
       database_role, changed_at
from opengeni_private.verified_signup_trial_switch_revisions
order by revision desc
limit 1;
```

What the switch guarantees:

- The setter holds an exclusive advisory lock until commit. Each grant takes
  the shared form of that lock before it reads the switch. After a disable
  commits, no setup that commits later can still receive a grant.
- A setup that runs while grants are off still succeeds, but gets no credit.
  Turning grants back on never backfills it: its one-shot receipt already
  exists.
- The setter is `SECURITY DEFINER` and callable only by its owner. PUBLIC and
  every runtime role lack `EXECUTE`. The migration strips every non-owner
  grant on the table and the setter at creation, including grants from default
  privileges. `db:provision-roles` revokes any later stray grant, and runtime
  posture fails readiness if a runtime role can call the setter or write the
  table. Runtime roles get `SELECT` only, from `db:provision-roles`.
- If the table has no revision, grants fail closed.

The control worker's sandbox-lease reaper pass (`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_LEASE_REAPER_PERIOD_MS`,
default 30 seconds) publishes two 0/1 gauges:

- `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_runtime_enabled`: the runtime switch
  (1 allows grants, 0 blocks them).
- `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_deployment_enabled`: the
  `OPENGENI_VERIFIED_SIGNUP_TRIAL_CREDITS_ENABLED` master opt-in as the worker's
  configuration sees it. The chart and deployment tooling give the API and the
  workers the same shared setting.

New grants happen only while both gauges are 1. The runtime gauge alone reads 1
on every deployment that never opted in, so never read it as "the trial is live".

## Meaningful child attention (0503)

`0503_session_meaningful_attention.sql` is a maintenance migration. Stop all old
API/control/turn workers, provide the exact application login list through
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` (or `applicationDatabaseRoles`),
and migrate before starting the matching binary. Do not restart pre-0503 writers:
they do not maintain the new personal `manually_unread_through` intent fence.
The nullable sequence (not a sticky boolean) is necessary to distinguish replay
of an old answer from consumption of activity newer than a human mark-unread.
Existing attention revisions do not record that event position. Although the
column is additive, old attention writers neither capture nor clear its fence
and old claim writers still advance to the current raw cursor. A mixed-version
rollout would therefore violate the attention contract; this focused migration
uses a drain rather than adding a second compatibility-trigger protocol.

The owner-only transactional NO FORCE windows cover `session_pins`,
`session_event_cursors`, and `session_events` and restore FORCE RLS before commit. The backfill protects
ambiguous historical human attention intent at the migration-time raw frontier;
only a newer proven consumed event or explicit mark-read clears that protection.
Human-read-through-final rows followed only by cleanup are not fenced. The old
schema cannot distinguish a manual mark made only against housekeeping from such
a read; no historical intent is invented when meaningful work is already read.
The backfill never advances an acknowledgement cursor. Meaningful frontier derivation clears bookkeeping-only dots without a
backfill over event history. Optional bounded historical consumption repair is
dry-run by default; see [session monitoring](session-monitoring-mcp.md#child-unread-and-consumption).

## Consented sandbox recovery (0495)

Fresh bootstrap may migrate before runtime roles exist. Migration 0495 grants
read access to existing configured roles only; normal `db:provision-roles`
converges newly created and later-added app roles to SELECT-only access on the
rollout row. Re-provisioning revokes activation writes and PUBLIC access; it
never enables consent. Do not precreate runtime roles merely to run migration.

`0495_consented_sandbox_recovery.sql` is additive and rolling, but does not enable
consent. Supply the runtime login list through
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` (or `applicationDatabaseRoles`),
migrate and provision the normal application role. The owner-only
`opengeni_private.sandbox_recovery_rollout` singleton defaults to disabled;
runtime roles receive SELECT only. Database triggers reject new consent while
disabled, regardless of API/UI configuration. Additive DDL may briefly wait for
locks; rolling does not mean zero latency impact.

Before deliberate activation, the deployment owner must verify immutable
API/control/turn image digests, drain incompatible in-flight workers, and inspect
all templates that can recreate them, including scaled-to-zero deployments and
jobs. Record that verified release evidence when changing `consent_enabled` to
true as the migration owner. This is an operator procedure, not a public API or
an action performed by migration. Evidence text records attribution; it is not
binary attestation. Never inject `opengeni.filesystem_discontinuity_protocol_v1`
through role defaults, connection configuration or deployment settings.

Before the first accepted consent, application rollback remains compatible with
the additive schema. Afterwards, finalized consent receipts permanently require
the warning-aware worker protocol at attempt INSERT, including conflicting-insert
reattachment. Old workers fail closed only for affected sessions; repeated old
claims can still harm availability. Disabling new consent does not erase this
protection, invalidate exact receipt replay or interrupt accepted restoration.
Rollback after use is limited to warning-compatible builds. Session deletion
alone removes its warning receipt through the legitimate parent cascade.

This adds canonical-human consent for singleton managed-home Modal recovery only.
Consent itself never recovers shared groups, replays commands, resets to an empty
workspace or changes the cancellation/reaper protocol. System continuity after
definitive loss is separate (0526 and 0548 below). See [run lifecycle](run-lifecycle.md).

## Automatic checkpoint continuity (0526)

`0526_automatic_checkpoint_discontinuity.sql` is maintenance-only. Stop old
API/control/turn workers, migrate and provision roles, then start only the
matching binaries. A pre-0520 worker does not reconstruct a system-selected
filesystem warning. The replacement claim guard requires the worker's
transaction-local warning protocol v2 for sessions with an automatic receipt;
human-consented sessions still require v1. Never put either declaration in a
role default, pool configuration or deployment environment.

The worker may automatically select the registered CURRENT native Modal
checkpoint of a managed home when definitive provider loss made its archive
generation older than the workspace generation (shared groups since 0548).
Selection is a separate system-attributed durable receipt, not human consent or
proof of restore. The ordinary provider snapshot and artifact verification must
finish before the box is usable. Live writers in any group member still block.
Every affected agent attempt
reconstructs a deterministic warning after the static instruction prefix;
unknown command outcomes are never replayed. Operator metrics and alerts
record the fallback even when the next turn succeeds. A read-only, aggregate
`opengeni_private.sandbox_recovery_observations()` inventory reconstructs
the last 30 minutes of provider-loss and fallback decisions from a small
indexed private ledger, committed with their RLS-verified source audit events.
The ledger stores only event IDs and fixed kinds, not tenant or provider data;
normal role provisioning grants exact EXECUTE-only capabilities, not table reads.

## Lost sandbox group continuity (0548)

`0548_lost_sandbox_group_continuity.sql` is rolling. It only extends guards for a
new receipt kind and adds one fixed operator-ledger kind; rows and receipts that
older images write keep their exact 0526 behavior, and older images never create
the new receipt. Apply it before rolling API/control/turn images, then provision
roles as usual. During the overlap an older worker fails closed (SQLSTATE
`55000` at attempt claim, retried by the ordinary wake) only for a session that
holds an empty-workspace receipt, and older API/worker images keep refusing the
new lanes, so affected sessions stay blocked until the new images serve them.
Rollback of images after a fresh-workspace decision is limited to v3-warning
builds for those sessions; do not roll the migration back.

After definitive Modal loss (the reaper's missing-before-capture commit or an
exact warm-instance `NOT_FOUND`, never a failed replacement box) the worker
decides, for the complete quiescent sandbox group, either the latest verified
checkpoint (outcomes `selected` and `selected_shared`) or, when none can be
restored automatically, continuation on a new EMPTY workspace
(`fresh_workspace`). Both write one permanent warning receipt per group member;
the empty-workspace receipt requires warning protocol v3 at claim. The empty
workspace additionally waits until the lost box is past its hard provider
lifetime (its stamped deadline plus one hour, else loss plus 24 hours). Only a
definitive, non-retryable content-integrity failure abandons a checkpoint; a
missing archive object or unconfigured archive storage never does, so fix
storage and Retry. Other restore failures retry with backoff and then wait for
an operator. A complete archive is never
bypassed. The lost archive fields and checkpoint references stay on the lease
for review. Sessions stuck before this release qualify on their next turn or
Retry when their loss is provable from the row or its loss audit; a capture
that was in flight when the box vanished may publish only within one hour, and
decisions wait for that window. `OpenGeniModalFreshWorkspaceContinuity` warns
on each empty-workspace decision; see [run lifecycle](run-lifecycle.md) and the
Sandbox Health dashboard notes.

## Selective Knowledge source discovery (0469)

`0469_knowledge_source_discovery.sql` requires maintenance. Stop every API,
control-worker and turn-worker using this database. Supply every old/new runtime
login through `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` (or
`applicationDatabaseRoles` for programmatic migration). Missing/invalid roles or
a live listed identity abort with SQLSTATE `55000`. Apply migrations and start
only the new source-purpose-aware binaries. Pre-0469 strict readers reject the
new `source.purpose` field; do not restart them after activation.

The migration changes discovery, not retained content. Typed historical chat and
agent-prepared file evidence disappears from default published search/listing;
explicit evidence reads, review, references, original files and revision history
remain available. No customer content is deleted or rewritten. Ordinary chat
attachments stop creating source entries automatically. See [Knowledge](knowledge.md).


## Unified Knowledge cutover (0461)

`0461_unified_knowledge.sql` is a maintenance migration. Stop every API,
control worker and turn worker that uses the target database, then supply every
runtime login through `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`. A live
listed login aborts activation. Back up the database and its retained object
storage before the cutover.

Run `bun run db:migrate` with the new binary's TypeScript migration runner;
running the SQL file directly is unsupported and fails. Its conversion callback
preserves legacy content and references, creates canonical Knowledge revisions,
imports pending review work and converts pending text-only Skill proposals into
valid folders. It freezes the retired Memory/learning writers and changes the
runtime role/posture contract. Run `bun run db:provision-roles`, then
`bun run db:assert-runtime-posture` before starting only the new API and workers.
Never restart a pre-0461 runtime after commit. Rollback requires restoring the
consistent pre-cutover backup with the matching old binary.

Source schedules keep their ids, cadence, selected source and connector version,
but receive an ordinary `agent_turn` revision. Unfinished native source occurrences
are closed with `knowledge_source_agent_cutover`; checkpoints and provider cursors
are retained for the next agent run. Historical native workflow inputs cannot
fetch provider content after activation. An owning human with current source and
connection authority is required. Legacy schedules without an active organization
member who can access the control workspace are preserved paused; that owner
must update and re-enable the source before it can run. Personal sources
additionally require private session availability. Source fetching now includes ordinary agent/model usage.

The new control worker registers the Knowledge indexing schedule. Search caches
are rebuildable; original files, canonical revisions, evidence and review
receipts are retained authorities. Old learning source exceptions remain
historical evidence: set future exceptions on the relevant chat or scheduled
task. Existing category opt-outs are preserved.
See [Knowledge](knowledge.md) for scope, review and compatibility behavior.

### Native instance resolver registration (0463)

`0463_host_mcp_resolver_registration.sql` adds organization-owned encrypted
resolver configuration and append-only, metadata-only operation receipts.
This is a maintenance-only runtime-role contract change: stop old API/control/
turn workers, supply every application database role, migrate, provision the
matching roles, and start only matching binaries. Do not restart pre-0463 code.
Configure `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` consistently across API/workers.
This is historical schema guidance. The current runtime has removed the resolver
registration API and callback execution; new integrations use ordinary native
OAuth connections. See [cutover notes](remote-mcp-credentials.md#native-instance-registration).

`0467_host_resolver_full_organization_keys.sql` is a rolling correction to the
existing write trigger: resolver administration uses the `workspace:admin`
permission issued by full organization API keys, not human `account:admin`.
This correction remains part of migration history; it does not restore resolver
administration in the current API.

### Host MCP, native-link and Connect authority migrations (0443–0456)

`0443_host_mcp_binding_registry.sql`, `0444_host_mcp_delegations.sql`, and
`0445_host_mcp_turn_authorities.sql` introduce the registry and direct-turn contract.
Migrations 0446–0448 extend it with exact causal continuation, immutable task
revision selections, and guarded child inheritance.
Migrations 0449–0452 add optional native consent, immutable linked-work provenance,
bounded consent identity previews and scheduled-origin checks. Migration 0453
allows separately owned native host bindings through organization membership;
it never transfers an external binding or changes existing resource owners.
Migration 0454 preserves immutable external Connect origin authority separately
from the effective owner. All setup mutations and callback receipts recheck that
origin as well as current request authority; changing API keys cannot bypass
revocation. Do not restart a pre-0454 Connect writer that omits this restriction.
Migration 0455 adds bounded, participant-only identity labels for link inventory;
it does not grant application roles direct access to external identity mappings.
Migration 0456 versions social connections on every update, including refresh and
disconnect. Reconnect commits must match the observed version and upstream account;
a concurrent change produces a conflict rather than overwriting another account.
Stop old API and worker database sessions and provide the complete runtime login
list through `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` before migration.
Provision the matching binary's application role afterward; do not restart an
older runtime against this schema. The new registry stores no credentials and
does not automatically opt existing host references or inline credentials into
durable renewal. A registered binding alone never authorizes execution: accepted
work must capture an explicitly selected delegation.
The delegation migration adds owner-scoped, immutable grant metadata and terminal
revocation. Verified native and external owners can issue/read/revoke metadata through the
API and SDK; direct human starts explicitly select grants for atomic
initial-turn capture. Worker runtime
validation requires an exact captured authority snapshot and denies missing records.
Existing inline credentials remain unchanged; durable renewal is still opt-in.
Migration 0445 adds direct-turn snapshot storage with a canonical insert guard
and SELECT/INSERT-only application privileges. Its binding/delegation foreign
keys prevent deleting referenced metadata while accepted work remains. Internal
capture is reached through verified direct-create admission, gated by the host
authority fleet switch. Follow-up send/steer captures selections atomically on
fresh turns. Scheduled selections are frozen per task revision and captured at
claim in all three existing execution modes. Causal resumptions copy only their
exact source; children inherit only selected, live `always` grants, never a
parent's session-bound grant. Scheduled descendants retain their scheduled origin
for live authorization. No worker needs the original host API key. Drain the
complete API/control-worker/turn-worker fleet for these maintenance migrations;
deploy matching code and provision runtime privileges before enabling host renewal.

OpenGeni deployment work is organized around a repo-owned deployment contract, deterministic artifacts, and conformance checks. Repository CI validates deployment artifacts; it does not deploy maintainer-owned preview infrastructure from pull requests.

Managed deployments using organization recovery must first complete the
provider-neutral browser-slot rollout and then follow the migration,
fake-provider conformance, rollback, and unsupported-operation contract in
[`organization-recovery.md`](organization-recovery.md). Repository delivery does
not enable an external recovery notification provider or perform a production
mutation.

## Organization-scoped external workspace cutover

Migration `0437_organization_scoped_external_workspaces.sql` is maintenance-only.
The combined embedding cutover includes `0457_canonical_session_scope_subject.sql`:
drain every old API/control-worker/turn-worker database login, provide the complete
application-role list, and start only the matching release. Do not restart old
label-authority writers. The new canonical scope column is nullable for old
sessions; no user is inferred from unverified historical end-user labels.
Historical session-scoped Memory rows remain stored, but their old session
selector reads as `off`; new requests must use workspace/user/off and task notes
for task-local data. Do not backfill private rows into workspace Memory.
Stop every old API, control worker, and turn worker, and supply the exact runtime
database login list through `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`.
The migration checks those sessions before and after its workspace lock, replaces
the external identity index with organization/source/id uniqueness, and updates
the native membership conflict targets and personal-workspace conflict guard.
Existing workspace IDs and rows are preserved. After commit, do not restart an
old binary: its global `ON CONFLICT` target no longer matches the database.
Rollback requires a reviewed database restore or forward repair, not an old image.

Migration `0438_durable_connect_attempts.sql` adds actor-scoped setup state and
changes the exact FORCE-RLS/runtime table contract. Drain the same complete
API/worker role list, apply it, then run `db:provision-roles` for the matching
runtime role. Do not restart an older binary after this cutover. Attempt state
and operation receipts are distinct from provider credentials. Claims are not
reclaimed merely because the caller times out; an uncertain provider effect
requires reconciliation. Actor-local creation prunes at most 100 attempts older
than 30 days after expiry, including their setup idempotency receipts, but never
deletes the associated Connection.

Migration `0439_external_identity_provisioning.sql` requires the same maintenance
drain and matching role provisioning. Migrations
`0440_external_workspace_member_removal.sql` and
`0441_external_identity_membership_lifecycle.sql` are rolling extensions of the
existing lifecycle routines. The first adds live-key external-member removal;
the second adds explicit service attribution to immutable organization lifecycle
history and synchronizes external admission generations with member transitions.
Both refuse drift in the existing privileged function definitions. Neither
grants Personal/private access or changes retention/scheduling policy. Service
transitions require explicit `account:admin`, and reactivation does not restore
revoked memberships or durable grants. Include the nullable native actor and
separate service subject when projecting lifecycle audit records.

Migration `0442_external_owning_user_authority.sql` adds persisted external-owner
consistency checks to the existing self-membership and private-create routines.
It does not activate private sessions: platform readiness and shared-workspace
organization settings still apply. Pair it with the API's dedicated external
owning-user proof; do not synthesize native-cookie flags or grant Personal
workspace membership to service keys. The matching runtime adds live external
authority checks before session-create, visibility-change, and fork commits.

The former remote host MCP credential adapter and its environment setting are
removed. Use native OAuth connections; see [cutover notes](remote-mcp-credentials.md).

## Workspace MCP OAuth

The public MCP authorization server is disabled by default. Enable it only in
managed or local product-access mode with
`OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED=true` and an exact credential-free
`OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` origin. Non-local environments require HTTPS.
Generated runtime env and Helm artifacts carry the explicit enable switch and,
when set, `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`; enabling OAuth makes the public base
URL a required artifact input and rejects configured product-access profiles
before deployment.

The deployment then publishes authorization-server and protected-resource
metadata, public Dynamic Client Registration, and authorization-code/token
endpoints for the exact workspace MCP resources. Consent uses the existing
current-human browser session; no separate OAuth signing secret is required.
Access and refresh values are opaque, only their hashes are retained, and the
runtime accepts access tokens only on `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/mcp`,
`/mcp/docs`, or `/mcp/files`. Keep the public base URL stable across upgrades
because it is the issuer and part of every exact resource identifier. See
[`mcp-surfaces.md`](mcp-surfaces.md) for the client-facing contract.

Dynamic client registration is durably limited to 20 registrations per source
and 600 registrations globally per ten-minute window. Registrations that are
never used expire after one day; successful client use extends retention
through the refresh-token lifetime plus one day. Bounded opportunistic cleanup
removes expired clients, consent requests, authorization codes, access tokens,
and refresh tokens without requiring a separate scheduler.

The source quota keys on the API request source address described in
[API request source and auth rate limits](#api-request-source-and-auth-rate-limits):
the transport peer by default, or the forwarded client when
`OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` declares a trusted proxy chain.

Current-human HTTP/SDK calls classified for human approval use the ordinary API
database and require migration `0405_tool_gateway_approval_capabilities.sql`.
No additional secret or service is required. The API stores only a token hash,
binds each capability to the current human and exact call, expires it after five
minutes, and consumes it once. Issuance opportunistically removes bounded
expired/consumed rows. Existing database readiness therefore covers this path.
Site calls do not use this approval store: their active immutable version's
requested identities are intersected with the current viewer's live gateway and
revalidated by the API on every direct call.

Migrations `0404_mcp_oauth_authorization_server.sql` and
`0405_tool_gateway_approval_capabilities.sql` are one drained maintenance
boundary even when `OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED=false`. They add tables, grants,
and FORCE-RLS state to the exact startup/readiness posture, so neither the
previous runtime evaluator nor the target evaluator can operate in a mixed
pre/post-schema fleet. Follow the
[0404-0405 operator cutover](#mcp-oauth-and-tool-gateway-posture-cutover-0404-0405)
before deploying the release that contains them.

Refresh-token rotation is family-fenced. Reuse of any known revoked generation
atomically revokes every descendant refresh and access token before returning
`invalid_grant`.

Gateway calls emit `opengeni_tool_gateway_operations_total` and
`opengeni_tool_gateway_operation_duration_seconds` with bounded adapter,
operation, source, and outcome labels. The same observer emits
`opengeni.tool_gateway.operation` spans and safe structured log attributes
(`surface`, `op`, `provider`, `outcome`, `durationMs`). It never emits workspace,
subject, tool-name, argument, result, credential, or approval-token values.

## MCP provider OAuth short-state rollout (0507)

Apply rolling migration `0507_integration_oauth_pending_states.sql`, then deploy
the new API with `OPENGENI_INTEGRATIONS_OAUTH_SHORT_STATE_ENABLED=false` on all
replicas. Once every old API replica has drained, set the flag to `true` in a
separate configuration rollout. Both flag values accept old and short callback
states; only new replicas can read short states. Providers such as Resend that
limit `state` length work after the flag is enabled.

## Personal GitHub OAuth

Personal GitHub is disabled by default. Managed staging and production must use
different GitHub OAuth Apps and configure the exact API-origin callback
`/v1/integrations/github-personal/oauth/callback`. Local and self-hosted
operators create one OAuth App for their own installation; localhost HTTP is
accepted in local/test, while non-local environments require HTTPS. Keep device
flow disabled and store each client secret only in that environment's secret
manager. Runtime
artifacts pass through `OPENGENI_GITHUB_PERSONAL_OAUTH_ENABLED`,
`OPENGENI_GITHUB_PERSONAL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and
`OPENGENI_GITHUB_PERSONAL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`; enabling the feature also
requires integrations state signing and environment encryption. See
[`personal-github.md`](personal-github.md) for the authority and rollout
contract. Repository delivery does not create the external OAuth Apps or write
their secrets.

## Profiles

List supported profiles:

```bash
bun run deployment:profiles
```

Render a stack plan before creating anything. The plan lists resource classes,
platform dependencies managed by wrapper commands, external dependencies,
required secret keys, deploy commands, verification commands, and destroy
commands:

```bash
bun run deployment:stack -- --profile gcp-managed
bun run deployment:stack -- --profile aws-existing-services --json
```

After Terraform apply, generate private deployment artifacts from Terraform
outputs and the current shell variable set. The generated Helm values file
contains non-secret provider wiring; `runtime.env` is intended for a private
Kubernetes Secret and must not be committed:

For the API, control worker, and turn worker, the chart loads the Helm ConfigMap
before the selected runtime Secret. If both sources define the same key, the
protected runtime value is authoritative. This permits reviewed runtime
provider/model rotations without weakening the application's configured-model
allow-list; keep the Secret and non-secret Helm defaults intentionally aligned
for the next ordinary deployment.

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp output -json \
  > .agent/generated/gcp-managed/terraform-output.json

OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY="$OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY" \
OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL="$OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL" \
  bun run deployment:runtime-artifacts -- \
  --profile gcp-managed \
  --terraform-output .agent/generated/gcp-managed/terraform-output.json \
  --out-dir .agent/generated/gcp-managed

kubectl -n opengeni create secret generic opengeni-runtime \
  --from-env-file=.agent/generated/gcp-managed/runtime.env \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Single-machine Kubernetes

`deploy/helm/opengeni/values.single-node.example.yaml` is the supported
persistent, non-HA profile for running the complete control plane on one
machine. Kubernetes is used only as the process, restart, volume, and upgrade
supervisor. It is not an autoscaling or failover layer in this profile.

The profile renders one API, web, control worker, turn worker, relay, Postgres,
Temporal, NATS, and Garage process. It disables HPAs, disruption budgets, and
topology spreading. Container resource requests and limits are omitted, so a
busy role may use otherwise-idle CPU and memory on the machine.

The profile creates four non-preempting Pod priority tiers. Under
kubelet-managed node pressure, presentation (web and relay) is evicted before
turn execution, then live control (API, control worker, and NATS), while
durable services and the migration gate are retained longest. Priority is not a
CPU or memory partition, and it cannot order a kernel OOM that happens before
kubelet reacts. Configure a node-wide `memory.available` eviction threshold
with enough measured OS/Kubernetes headroom, and include every disk/inode
threshold when overriding `eviction-hard`; Kubernetes otherwise zeroes omitted
defaults. This preserves elastic sharing while giving the kubelet room to
enforce the intended order.

The API's single-node readiness probe uses `/traffic-readyz`, which checks only
Postgres. If NATS or Temporal restarts, Kubernetes keeps routing safe
database-backed reads while commands that need the unavailable dependency fail
explicitly and recover after reconnect. `/readyz` remains the complete
Postgres/NATS/Temporal dependency report, so the outage is still visible to
operators. Losing Postgres fails both readiness paths.

The one turn worker uses Temporal's resource-based slot tuner. It admits more
agent turns while whole-machine CPU stays below 80% and memory stays below 75%,
up to 256 active turns; excess work remains durable in Temporal. This is a
safety ceiling, not a reservation or a promise that 256 heavy turns fit. The
ordinary chart default remains a fixed 16 turns per worker so multi-worker
deployments can scale replicas predictably. Fixed/HPA turn workers use a custom
Temporal slot supplier that reserves 100 MiB for the complete physical
`runAgentTurn` promise lifetime, retains 512 MiB for runtime/native/GC headroom,
and refuses another poll when either the startup-baseline or current-cgroup
projection would exceed the pod memory limit. Logical settlement, drain, or a
quiescence recovery receipt never releases that permit early; Temporal releases
it only after the physical activity promise ends. Resource-based turn workers
also sample the most pressured finite process cgroup or ancestor every five
seconds after admission, falling back to whole-host `MemAvailable` only when no
finite cgroup exists. Process RSS pressure first receives a bounded asynchronous
GC opportunity. If the authoritative scope remains at or above the distinct 90%
emergency threshold for 30 seconds, it
requests the ordinary graceful worker drain so
in-flight turns checkpoint and recover on replacement capacity. Override the
emergency threshold, cadence, and sustained window with
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_EMERGENCY_MEMORY_USAGE`,
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_MEMORY_GUARD_INTERVAL_MS` and
`OPENGENI_TURN_WORKER_MEMORY_GUARD_SUSTAIN_MS`; do not replace this protection
with a turn-duration limit or a blind hard kill. Managed profiles may combine a
hard per-process maximum with resource-based admission and HPA.

The ordinary dependency services remain private `ClusterIP` services. Five
one-port NodePort services are the complete private-edge surface:

| NodePort | Destination    | Purpose                                      |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `30080`  | web            | browser application                          |
| `30081`  | API            | API, SSE, enrollment, and agent distribution |
| `30222`  | NATS websocket | enrolled-machine command/event transport     |
| `30443`  | relay          | live terminal/desktop byte streams           |
| `30900`  | Garage S3 API  | signed browser file transfer only            |

The NATS client/monitor ports and Garage RPC/admin/web ports are not exposed. On K3s,
bind NodePorts to loopback with
`--kube-proxy-arg=nodeport-addresses=127.0.0.0/8`, then publish only the five
loopback listeners through a private edge such as Tailscale Serve. Route `/` to
web and route `/v1`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/traffic-readyz`,
`/install.sh`, `/install.ps1`, `/uninstall.sh`,
`/opengeni-agent-minisign.pub`, and `/agent` to the API. Give the NATS
websocket, relay, and Garage S3 API their own private TLS ports. Set
`selfhosted.natsUrl`, `selfhosted.relayUrl`, and `garage.publicEndpoint` to those
private URLs. Also set `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the browser/API origin. The
API uses it when serving the installer, so an enrolled machine downloads the
agent version baked into this deployment and connects back to that same external
HTTPS origin rather than falling back to either public default.

HTTPS/WSS is the supported private-edge posture. The web bootstrap retains a
cryptographically random UUID compatibility path so a private HTTP origin can
render the core workspace UI and useful diagnostics instead of crashing, but
that fallback does not make HTTP feature-complete: browsers still withhold APIs
used by uploads, voice, clipboard, and encrypted browser-side artifact
operations. Treat HTTPS as required for every non-loopback browser address;
localhost and loopback development URLs remain subject to the browser's secure
context rules. On an insecure self-hosted origin, the stock console keeps a
persistent warning visible, and picker, drag-and-drop, and pasted-image
attachments all fail before any upload request with the typed SDK code
`secure_context_required` plus HTTPS setup guidance on the attachment card.
OpenGeni deliberately does not provide a hashing fallback that would make only
uploads appear healthy while the rest of the secure-browser feature contract
remains broken.

For a tailnet-only deployment, `OPENGENI_AUTH_REQUIRED=false` and
`OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE=local` mean there is no shared deployment access
key; tailnet membership is the outer access boundary. Internal database, NATS,
enrollment-signing, relay-token, object-storage, and model-provider credentials
remain required because services must still authenticate to each other. They
are not an additional user-facing gateway.

Create the four Secrets before installation:

- `opengeni-postgres`: the Postgres owner `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`;
- `opengeni-garage`: `GARAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `GARAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
  `GARAGE_RPC_SECRET`, and the `garage.toml` file (the image has no shell);
- `opengeni-runtime`: the restricted `opengeni_app`
  `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL`, the environments encryption key, object-storage
  credentials, and Connected Machine signing/NATS/relay secrets;
- `opengeni-migrations`: the owner
  `OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL`,
  `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_USER=opengeni_app`, and
  `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD`.

Generate the matched database and NATS credentials locally. The command creates
a new mode-`0700` directory containing four mode-`0600` env files, refuses to
overwrite an existing directory, and prints no secret values:

```bash
bun run deployment:single-node-secrets -- \
  --out-dir .agent/generated/single-node/secrets

kubectl create namespace opengeni --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl -n opengeni create secret generic opengeni-postgres \
  --from-env-file=.agent/generated/single-node/secrets/postgres.env

kubectl -n opengeni create secret generic opengeni-garage \
  --from-env-file=.agent/generated/single-node/secrets/garage.env \
  --from-file=garage.toml=.agent/generated/single-node/secrets/garage.toml

kubectl -n opengeni create secret generic opengeni-runtime \
  --from-env-file=.agent/generated/single-node/secrets/runtime.env

kubectl -n opengeni create secret generic opengeni-migrations \
  --from-env-file=.agent/generated/single-node/secrets/migrations.env
```

This bootstrap does not require a model-provider API key. A workspace admin can
connect a ChatGPT/Codex subscription from workspace settings, or connect it once
from Organization settings → Models for inheritance by shared workspaces, after the
application starts. If the deployment instead uses API-billed models, add the
selected provider's credential to `opengeni-runtime` separately. Keep the
generated directory as a private recovery artifact or move the values into a
secret manager; never commit it. The generated environments encryption key must
remain stable across upgrades because it protects persisted subscription and
workspace credentials.

`OPENGENI_SUPERGROK_SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLED=true` additionally exposes the
SuperGrok/xAI connected-subscription rail. Workspace scope is the default shared
connection path; private user scope requires the exact managed-browser human.
Organization owners and admins can also share subscriptions with their shared
and Personal workspaces. Migration `0423_organization_supergrok_subscriptions.sql`
is a maintenance cutover: drain all API/control/turn processes, apply with the
complete runtime role list, and restart only the matching release. Older workers
cannot parse the new accepted-work organization scope.
The same stable environments encryption key protects its OAuth material. See
[`supergrok-subscription.md`](supergrok-subscription.md).
`OPENGENI_SUPERGROK_RESPONSE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` optionally overrides the
five-minute maximum silence between complete, valid SSE response events; it is
not a total model-call or agent-run deadline.

Migration `0390_organization_model_provider_connections.sql` is a maintenance
activation for organization-owned Vercel AI Gateway/OpenRouter keys and custom
models. Drain API/control/turn processes, apply with the complete application
role list, deploy the matching release, then restart. Pre-0390 workers do not
understand the new credential/billing branch. No new environment variable is
required; the stable environments encryption key protects these credentials.

Migration `0492_codex_accepted_source_authority.sql` is a forward-only maintenance
activation for non-blocking Codex source settings. Stop every old/new API,
control-worker, and turn-worker process, supply the complete runtime login list
through `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`, apply the migration, and
run `db:provision-roles`. Its before/after guards reject live listed database
sessions. Select
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0492_codex_accepted_source_authority`
for generated plans. Start only matching binaries; never restart pre-0492 images.
Do not cancel or require accepted turns to finish: preserve checkpoints and
recover those logical turns with their retained source. This one-time process
drain is distinct from ordinary settings changes, which require no idle window.

Migration `0422_personal_workspace_organization_codex_inheritance.sql` is a
maintenance activation for Personal workspace Codex inheritance. Stop all API,
control-worker, and turn-worker processes and provide every runtime login in
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`. Apply the migration, run
`db:provision-roles`, and start only the matching release. Select
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0422_personal_workspace_organization_codex_inheritance`
for generated deployment plans. Never restart a pre-0422 binary: its organization
Codex mutations omit Personal workspace source fences and capacity wakeups.

Bootstrap a new machine in two phases. First install only the persistent
dependencies and wait until they are healthy:

```bash
helm upgrade --install opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni --create-namespace \
  --values deploy/helm/opengeni/values.single-node.example.yaml \
  --set api.enabled=false \
  --set worker.enabled=false \
  --set web.enabled=false \
  --set relay.enabled=false \
  --set migrations.enabled=false \
  --wait --timeout 10m
```

Then enable the application. Because this is an upgrade, the pre-upgrade
database Job can reach the already-running Postgres. It applies forward
migrations, converges the restricted runtime role, and proves a connection
through that role before Helm replaces application pods:

```bash
helm upgrade opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --values deploy/helm/opengeni/values.single-node.example.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 15m
```

Generated Kubernetes deployment plans default to one rolling `helm upgrade
--install`. Profiles whose durable dependencies live inside the OpenGeni chart
add the disabled-application revision only when the Helm release does not yet
exist, so bootstrap can create Postgres/Temporal/NATS/object storage before the
migration hook without turning every later release into an outage. A reviewed
maintenance migration must be selected explicitly; migration 0389 uses
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0389_model_catalog_and_gateway_custom_models`
plus `OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_PREFLIGHT_CONFIRMED=true` after the
operator completes the documented database-role, image-digest, and application
drain preflight. The 0404-0405 posture boundary uses
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0404_mcp_oauth_authorization_server`
with the same preflight acknowledgement. Migration 0394 likewise requires a complete API and worker
drain and
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0394_session_selected_skill_activation`;
a pre-0394 worker would treat the newly admitted activation mode as an ambient
workspace Skill, so none may remain live or restart after the cutover. Postgres
and Garage PVCs remain attached. Migration 0402 is another clean maintenance
cutover: stop every API, control worker, and turn worker, provide the exact old
and new runtime database login list through
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`, and select
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0402_session_input_wait_and_background_command_results`.
It moves active long-wait state from `session_goals` to `sessions`, removes the
old columns and `goal_wait` protocol, and activates terminal background-command
agent input. After it commits, never restart a pre-0402 image. This forward-only
cutover was documented on September 3, 2026. Migration 0403 likewise requires
a complete API and worker drain and
`OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0403_codex_unconditional_credential_leasing`;
before applying it, provide
`OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` as the comma-separated list of
every old and new runtime database login that may still be connected. Include
both roles when rotating the runtime login, and use
`MigrationRuntimeOptions.applicationDatabaseRoles` for embedded callers. The
list must be explicit, non-empty, unique, and contain no role longer than 63
UTF-8 bytes; migration 0403 rechecks it before and after taking its locks and
aborts with SQLSTATE `55000` when the list is missing, malformed, or any listed
application session remains live. It removes the temporary Codex allocator
cutover columns, so pre-0403 binaries must never run or restart after commit.
Database migrations
are forward-only: after a maintenance migration succeeds, remain on the new
image/schema and fix forward.

Failure behavior is intentionally uneven:

- web and relay hold no durable product state; losing them removes the browser
  UI or live terminal/desktop streams;
- a turn worker can restart while queued work remains in Temporal/Postgres;
- NATS stores no authoritative history, but losing it disconnects enrolled
  machines and pauses their command path as well as live fanout;
- Garage owns uploaded file bytes;
- Temporal owns durable orchestration state;
- Postgres owns the durable product record and database migration ledger.

This profile promises restart and persistence on one machine, not service
continuity while that machine is down.

### Database identities and runtime posture

On managed PostgreSQL where only a provider administrator can install pgvector,
install it in the target database's `public` schema before the first migration.
Set `OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_PREINSTALLED_VECTOR=true` for the migration Job (or
`MigrationRuntimeOptions.preinstalledVector` for a programmatic invocation).
The runner verifies the extension-owned `public.vector` type and omits only the
exact vector-installation statement in `0000_initial.sql`. A missing extension
or changed initial preamble fails before initial migration DDL; other migrations
and the default path remain unchanged. Do not set this flag merely to hide an
extension permission error without independently confirming installation.

The ordinary SQL migration runner applies a transaction-local 5-second
`lock_timeout` before each migration body. This bounds lock acquisition in
migrations without a later timeout override, including 0510. Migration-specific
`SET LOCAL` and historical `SET`/`RESET lock_timeout` statements still control
subsequent statements; a historical migration that resets the setting before
more DDL does not retain this default bound. Review those files separately.
A lock-wait timeout fails the Job without recording that migration in
`schema_migrations`; the implicit transaction rolls back its DDL, so resolve
the blocker and retry the forward migration Job. This is a lock-acquisition
limit, not a statement-duration limit or permission to roll back an already-
applied migration. Concurrent-index and batched-backfill migrations retain
their separately governed lock-wait settings.

Standalone deployments using the default `OPENGENI_RLS_STRATEGY=force` require
two distinct secret paths:

- **migration/provisioning:** `OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL`,
  `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_USER=opengeni_app`, and the corresponding
  `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD`; this identity owns/applies schema and is
  available only to migration and role-provision Jobs;
- **ordinary runtime:** `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL`, structurally targeting the same
  database but authenticating as `opengeni_app`; this is the only database URL
  available to API and worker containers.

After every migration and before rolling workloads, the Helm migration hook runs:

```bash
bun run db:provision-roles
bun run db:assert-runtime-posture
```

The Job receives the ordinary runtime Secret first and the separate
migration-only Secret second. This gives the assertion the restricted
`OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL` while keeping the owner URL and provisioning password
out of API and worker pods. Its default command serializes `db:migrate`,
`db:provision-roles`, and `db:assert-runtime-posture`; any failure aborts
`helm upgrade` before workload replacement begins. Operators running without
Helm must preserve the same order explicitly.

After a successful install or upgrade, the default-on `catalogImport` hook Job
imports the committed reviewed integrations snapshot. It receives the runtime
Secret for object-storage configuration but overrides `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL`
from the migration-only Secret because global catalog and import-provenance
tables are deliberately unavailable to the runtime role. The Job uses a SHA-256
snapshot reference and performs no database, network, or logo-storage work when
that exact revision already completed. Set `catalogImport.enabled=false` to opt
out. Network logo fetching is disabled by default so third-party availability
cannot block a rollout, but the curated connector set still renders logos: the
importer copies the reviewed assets vendored under `data/catalog/logos/` into
object storage regardless of `skipLogos`, so a default install shows logos for
every curated connector without an external image request. Set
`catalogImport.skipLogos=false` to additionally fetch, validate, and self-host
logos for the uncurated long tail. See the vendored-logo notes in
[`capabilities.md`](capabilities.md#vendored-logos).

The provisioner converges `opengeni_app` to `LOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS
NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB NOREPLICATION NOINHERIT`, refuses to guess through any
privilege-bearing role membership or ownership, revokes database/schema creation
and all table privileges, then grants the exact current-ledger table contract:
full CRUD on 83 ordinary runtime tables; SELECT only on
`nested_agent_depth_configuration`, preference lifecycle events, and preference
snapshots; SELECT + INSERT on five append-only/proposal/revision tables; and no
direct table DML on the five FORCE-RLS host-export tables. Preference head
UPDATE/DELETE is available only through target-schema-local SECURITY DEFINER
lock/lifecycle functions, which migrate-then-provision explicitly regrants.
PostgreSQL 16+ automatically records an ADMIN-only reverse membership when a
non-superuser `CREATEROLE` principal creates the app role. Provisioning and
posture checks accept only that exact creator-management edge when `SET=false`,
`INHERIT=false`, and the grantor is a superuser. It cannot inherit the app
role's privileges or activate them with `SET ROLE`; every outbound edge,
privilege-bearing reverse edge, uncertain grantor, and PostgreSQL 15 edge is
still rejected.
When the provisioning principal is not a superuser, OpenGeni first proves
`SUPERUSER`, `BYPASSRLS`, `CREATEDB`, and `REPLICATION` are already false, then
converges only the role attributes PostgreSQL permits a `CREATEROLE`
administrator to alter. An unsafe protected attribute fails with an explicit
operator action instead of being left for runtime startup to discover.
The runtime assertion connects through the runtime URL and checks, using only
PostgreSQL catalogs in a repeatable-read/read-only transaction:

- exact current/session role, attributes, zero privilege-bearing role-graph edges, and
  `row_security=on`;
- no database/schema/relation/private-routine ownership and no database/schema
  CREATE;
- exactly 86 declared tenant tables with ENABLE + FORCE + active RLS and at
  least one policy each;
- exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grants for each declared privilege class,
  absence of TRUNCATE/REFERENCES/TRIGGER everywhere, and no privileges on any
  undeclared or protected no-direct-DML table;
- access to the `opengeni_private` helpers.

API and worker startup run the same assertion before NATS, Temporal, HTTP
serving, or workflow polling begins. Their readiness endpoints repeat it instead
of treating `select 1` as database readiness. `OPENGENI_RUNTIME_DATABASE_ROLE`
defaults to and should remain `opengeni_app` for standalone deployments.

The `scoped` strategy is an explicit embedding contract: OpenGeni checks only
coherent connectivity/identity because the host owns the role and isolation
boundary. It must not be used to bypass the standalone `force` posture.

Changing an existing standalone environment from an owner, superuser, or
`BYPASSRLS` runtime identity to `opengeni_app` is an identity/ownership cutover,
not an ordinary rolling secret edit. Serialize the first transition through a
reviewed maintenance plan: stop admission/claiming, preserve the migration-only
URL, update the runtime Secret to the restricted URL, provision, run the posture
probe from that exact Secret, then start only the posture-gated runtime. A
rollback may restore a compatible image digest, but must never restore the old
broad database URL or role attributes. If an older image cannot run through the
restricted role, remain in maintenance and fix forward.

Migration `0138_sandbox_checkpoint_artifacts_and_deadlines.sql` is also a
maintenance-only protocol cutover. Old workers do not stamp provider deadlines
or honor rotation admission fences, so a rolling/mixed-version application
deployment would create permanently unrotatable leases after the one-time
backfill. The required sequence is:

1. bind and verify the exact production subscription, cluster context,
   namespace, release, database, and image digests;
2. stop the API, control-worker, and turn-worker Deployments while preserving
   the migration-only secret and Job identity;
3. query `pg_stat_activity` through the migration connection and prove zero
   other sessions with `usename = 'opengeni_app'`;
4. run the new digest's migration Job and require 0138 to appear in
   `schema_migrations`;
5. start only the same new digest's API and workers, then require startup/readiness
   posture checks before reopening traffic.

The migration repeats the `opengeni_app` guard before and after taking exclusive
lease-lifecycle table locks, so a missed live application fails with SQLSTATE
`55000` and leaves the prior schema intact. After 0138 commits, rollback to an
older application image is forbidden; stop admission and fix forward.

Migration `0197_knowledge_source_sync_schedules.sql` is likewise a
maintenance-only application and index cutover. A pre-0197 control worker does
not understand the scheduled-task action discriminator and can route a newly
created `knowledge_source_sync` task through session/model/billing dispatch.
The migration also replaces the live Document file-identity index. Therefore:

1. stop the API plus every control and turn worker before running 0197;
2. prove there are no other `opengeni_app` sessions in `pg_stat_activity`;
3. run the migration from the exact new image and require 0197 in
   `schema_migrations`;
4. start only that same image generation and complete readiness checks before
   reopening admission.

The migration repeats the application-session guard around exclusive locks on
the schedule and Document identity tables. A live application rejects the
cutover with SQLSTATE `55000`; a lock timeout or guard failure rolls back the
whole migration. After commit, never restart a pre-0197 image or attempt a
mixed-version rolling rollback—remain in maintenance and fix forward.

### Pre-registration invitation cutover (0314)

`0314_unregistered_organization_invitations.sql` is a drained application
protocol cutover. Old API binaries can accept an invitation without its initial
workspace grants and old authentication hooks can provision a fallback
organization before verified-email binding. Before applying 0313:

1. stop every API, control worker, and turn worker using the target database;
2. supply the exact old/new runtime login list through
   `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` (or
   `applicationDatabaseRoles` for a programmatic migration);
3. prove those roles have zero other sessions in `pg_stat_activity`;
4. apply 0314 from the exact new image and require it in `schema_migrations`;
5. start only that same image generation and complete readiness checks before
   reopening admission.

The migration checks the explicit role list before and after exclusive locks
on the invitation and organization membership writer tables. A live listed
session rejects the cutover with SQLSTATE `55000`. After commit, never restart
a pre-0314 image; remain in maintenance and fix forward.

### Post-sign-in organization setup cutover (0348)

`0348_named_signup_and_user_setup.sql` is a drained application protocol
cutover. It moves self-service organization creation out of Better Auth signup
and behind the first verified managed-cookie sign-in, and adds the invitation
bound one-time account setup bearer. Old API binaries and old authentication
hooks still synthesize a `better-auth:user` fallback organization and a
`Default workspace`, and old browser clients do not speak the Personal-only
setup contract. Before applying 0348:

1. stop every API, control worker, and turn worker using the target database;
2. supply the exact old/new runtime login list through
   `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` (or
   `applicationDatabaseRoles` for a programmatic migration);
3. prove those roles have zero other sessions in `pg_stat_activity`;
4. apply 0348 from the exact new image and require it in `schema_migrations`;
5. start only that same image generation and complete readiness checks before
   reopening admission.

The migration checks the explicit role list before and after exclusive locks on
`auth_users`, `auth_identities`, `managed_accounts`, the invitation tables, the
organization membership table, `workspaces`, and `workspace_memberships`. A
live listed session rejects the cutover with SQLSTATE `55000`. After commit,
never restart a pre-0348 image; remain in maintenance and fix forward.

### Session-event raw-lane cutover (0379)

`0379_session_event_raw_lane_activation.sql` moves accepted raw exact-attempt
appends off the wide `sessions` row while retaining cursor allocation, exact
turn/attempt fencing, and semantic state/event atomicity. Old API readers expose
`sessions.last_sequence`, and old SQL writers allocate from that projection, so
the cutover is drained rather than rolling:

1. stop every API, control worker, and turn worker using the target database;
2. supply the exact runtime login list through
   `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES`;
3. prove those roles have zero other sessions in `pg_stat_activity`;
4. apply 0379 from the exact new image and require it in `schema_migrations`;
5. start only that image generation and require readiness before reopening
   admission.

The migration repeats the role drain before and after exclusive locks on
`sessions`, `session_event_cursors`, and `session_events`, temporarily opens the
complete FORCE-RLS inventory to the migration owner, and refuses missing
cursors, sequence gaps, duplicates, or a session projection ahead of its
cursor. A deferred constraint keeps that projection from leading after commit.
For a forward application rollback, set
`OPENGENI_SESSION_EVENT_RAW_LANE_ENABLED=false`: the current image keeps cursor
validation active but restores wide-session locking and raw compatibility
writes. Do not restart a pre-0379 image after isolated raw traffic until the
session projection has been synchronized to every cursor under maintenance.

Two operator-visible consequences follow the commit. `POST /v1/organizations`
becomes the one-time setup entry point rather than an organization factory: a
human who already holds an organization membership can no longer create a
second organization through it. And `OPENGENI_API_CONTRACT_REVISION` advances,
so every cookie-authenticated browser tab must reload onto the new bundle before
its next mutation; bearer-authenticated integrations stay admitted (see
`docs/architecture.md` §3.10).

No backfill is required. A human left holding a legacy `better-auth:user`
fallback organization whose organization membership was never anchored is
adopted by the setup lifecycle on their next sign-in - it reuses that exact
account, names it from the one-shot signup intent, and creates the owner
membership plus canonical Personal workspace against it - so no operator SQL is
needed to unstick them. `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and
`OPENGENI_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` become required for invitation creation, which is
checked before the invitation row commits and reported as `503`.

### Browser login session-set rollout (0362)

`0362_managed_auth_session_sets.sql` is rolling and deliberately activation-free.
It backfills exact Better Auth login-binding stamps, installs hash-only/FORCE-RLS
browser session-set authority, and leaves
`OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_SESSION_SET_MODE=legacy`. Apply it with the owner migration
job and provision the restricted runtime routines before deploying the matching
API/web generation. Do not change the mode as part of migration or PR merge.

`dual` and `broker` require a fresh deployment authorization, one canonical HTTPS
web/API origin, consistent Better Auth signing/origin/cookie configuration, the
same mode on every API replica, and the complete real PostgreSQL/Better Auth plus
Chromium/Firefox/WebKit `accounts` acceptance lane. `dual` is the measured
coexistence state; `broker` is a later all-replica cutover. Never mix modes or
restart an arbitrary old image after broker activation. The complete rollout,
rollback, self-hosting, header/proxy, and security contract is
[`browser-login-session-sets.md`](browser-login-session-sets.md).

### Managed Google and GitHub sign-in

Managed deployments may enable either provider independently with
`OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` plus
`OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
`OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` plus
`OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. A partial pair is rejected at
startup. These credentials are separate from the Google Drive connector, the
personal GitHub connector, and the OpenGeni GitHub App, although an operator may
deliberately use an existing provider application when its redirect and consent
configuration is compatible.

Register these exact callback URLs against the canonical public origin:

- `<OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/v1/auth/callback/google`
- `<OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/v1/auth/callback/github`

The public client config exposes only the enabled provider names. OAuth tokens,
client secrets, Better Auth state, and provider session identifiers remain
server-side. Google and GitHub sign-ins may automatically attach a new login
method to an existing human only when the email matches and both the existing
email and the provider's email assertion are verified. This also supports a
verified email/password user signing in through a social provider. Linking adds
a method to that same canonical human; it never merges separate users or changes
organization memberships, workspace access, or billing ownership.

Keep provider email verification and local email verification checks enabled.
Do not use Better Auth's `trustedProviders` option to bypass the incoming
email-verification check. An unverified email or conflicting provider identity
must not silently acquire another human's authority.

Personal sign-in settings expose connected login methods separately from
repository, Gmail, and Drive integrations. Sensitive changes require fresh
authentication, and disconnecting the last usable method is refused. An explicit
disconnect must remain effective: subsequent same-email sign-in cannot silently
reconnect that method; the user must explicitly reconnect it with provider proof.

The sign-in-method boundary requires a maintenance rollout, not mixed old/new
API replicas. Follow [Personal sign-in methods](browser-login-session-sets.md#personal-sign-in-methods):
drain the old runtime writers, apply the migration and role provisioning, then
start the matching release. Do not restart an older API that exposes the raw
provider-management routes. This feature does not authorize changing the
deployment's configured browser session-set mode.

### Durable invited-user email delivery (0351)

Migration 0351 is rolling and additive. Before inviting users, configure
`OPENGENI_RESEND_API_KEY` and `OPENGENI_EMAIL_FROM`; production managed-mode
configuration validation requires the provider key. Embedded hosts may bind an
equivalent host-owned `ManagedEmailTransport` at API composition, but that seam
does not relax the deployment preflight today. Keep
`OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and `OPENGENI_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` stable: invitation
bearers are stable HMAC identities. The repository-safe default,
`OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_USER_SETUP_EMAIL_TOKEN_TRANSPORT=fragment`, preserves
compatibility with pre-query web images. Query transport is a deliberate
second-stage rollout because API and web replicas update independently:

Apply rolling migration
`0401_organization_user_setup_token_transport.sql` before deploying the API
that freezes and recovers per-delivery transport. Old API replicas continue to
use the v1 claim/prepare capabilities while the new API uses additive v2
capabilities. Migration 0401 replaces the v1 claim with a compatibility fence:
an old replica that reaches a query-frozen retry receives a clear database
error, and its nested claim/attempt mutation rolls back so a v2 replica can
service the row. Do not deploy the new API against a pre-0401 database.

1. deploy the new chart/web and 0401-aware API image everywhere while the
   setting remains
   `fragment`; verify every public web replica returns the protected
   `/setup-account` shell, its first inline head bootstrap executes before any
   subresource, and the dedicated Ingress exists for every host that routes to
   web. Confirm no pre-0401 API replica remains before enabling query mode;
2. prove every controller and external edge suppresses or redacts query-bearing
   request targets in access logs, traces, and error logs. Then set
   `OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_USER_SETUP_QUERY_EDGE_SANITIZATION_CONFIRMED=true`,
   change the transport setting to `query`, and roll the API. Email links then
   use a bounded query parameter so mail security gateways preserve it;
3. before any rollback, restore `fragment` on every API replica. A rollback to
   a pre-0401 API image additionally requires every retryable query-frozen
   failed or `outcome_unknown` delivery to be drained through a v2 replica or
   its invitation to be revoked and reissued; old replicas are deliberately
   unable to claim those rows. Before rolling web back to an image that
   predates query normalization, also wait until every previously sent query
   link has expired or revoke/reissue those invitations. An emergency rollback
   that skips either drain can strand live or retryable invitations.

The production web handler serves the setup shell directly with no-store,
no-referrer, and noindex protections and emits no redirect at all, preserving
the no-downgrade and untrusted-Host boundary behind TLS termination. HTTP
servers cannot inspect a URL fragment, so the first executable inline script in
the HTML head counts canonical query and fragment candidates together, rejects
ambiguity, and scrubs both with `history.replaceState` before the favicon,
module graph, or API work. It hands one token to the SPA through short-lived
process memory and never stores it. The same bootstrap works under Vite and
generic static serving. A deployment Content Security Policy must authorize
this exact inline bootstrap with its existing nonce/hash process; if it cannot,
leave query transport disabled. This compatibility does not make rollback to
an older SPA safe; follow the staged rollout above.

The managed Helm chart renders a dedicated exact ingress-nginx location only
for hosts that actually route to web and unconditionally disables both access
logging and ingress-nginx OpenTelemetry tracing there. Keep those protections,
and keep `ingress.setupAccountIngress.enabled=true` in query mode: chart
rendering fails closed if query transport would fall through the normally
logged/traced primary Ingress. This chart-owned route is required in addition
to the separate controller/edge error-log proof,
but do not treat them as query-log sanitization: ingress-nginx configures a
controller-wide `error_log`, and NGINX upstream failures/timeouts can append the
full request line, including `?token=...`. The chart and runtime therefore fail
query mode closed until the separate confirmation flag above is true.

For ingress-nginx, a location-scoped `error_log /dev/null;` supplied through
`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` is one supported mitigation
when the controller explicitly enables snippet annotations and admits their
Critical risk level. Because many clusters correctly disable snippets, this is
not a chart default or a portable guarantee. Verify the generated NGINX config
and force both upstream connection failures and timeouts while checking every
controller/sidecar sink before setting the confirmation flag. If snippets are
forbidden, use a reviewed custom controller template or an upstream edge with a
demonstrated request-target redaction policy; otherwise keep query transport
disabled. External load balancers, CDNs, WAFs, service meshes, analytics SDKs,
APM agents, non-NGINX ingresses, and other edges need the same access/trace/error
proof. The database continues to retain only the bearer digest.

The API records a durable attempt and `provider_started` marker before provider
I/O. A clear refusal is shown as `failed`; a network timeout, server ambiguity,
or released provider-started claim is shown as `outcome_unknown`. Do not repair
either state with database DML or by crafting a new email. Resend keeps an
idempotency key for 24 hours. Its adapter declares that guarantee and a keyed
provider-account scope; the database persists the resulting absolute safe-until
fence at the first provider boundary. People & invitations offers a retry for a
clear failure and for an ambiguous outcome only while that immutable provider-
specific fence remains open; retries never extend an unresolved fence and reuse
the exact delivery id, provider scope/key, bearer digest, effective
`OPENGENI_EMAIL_FROM`, and frozen safe payload. When the fence closes the state
becomes `reconciliation_required`: inspect Resend/provider history and do not
resend. A retry that fails before provider I/O cannot downgrade an older
unresolved outcome to an ordinary failure.
The delivery also freezes its setup-link transport at first preparation.
Changing the deployment default later does not change retries. For rolling rows
prepared by an older API, the new API derives both link forms and selects only
the one whose rendered message matches the stored payload digest, then persists
that recovered transport before provider I/O. Once a query transport has been
frozen, pre-0401 replicas cannot retry it: the v1 claim fence rolls back without
leaving a claim or attempt, while a v2 replica remains able to claim and prepare
the exact frozen query payload. Drain those rows or revoke/reissue their
invitations before a pre-0401 API rollback.
After confirming provider state, revoke the old invitation before deliberately
creating a new one if access is still required.

`Delivery not started` is the recoverable crash boundary between the committed
invitation and its first journal claim. Use its `Send invitation` control; the
server resolves the original immutable invite receipt, preserves the creator
binding, and creates the missing journal. Expired pre-provider claims project
as failed/retryable rather than staying pending. Do not insert or update journal
rows manually.
Revoking the invitation is authoritative even if an earlier provider call later
reports success, and revocation closes the active claim/attempt. The database
never stores the setup bearer or rendered email body.

Embedded `ManagedEmailTransport` implementations must declare a bounded sender,
a stable non-secret scope that changes with provider, provider account, or
idempotency policy, and a conservative integer retention in seconds. API
composition validates this metadata before accepting invitations. Changing the
scope while an outcome is unresolved is intentionally refused and requires
operator reconciliation.

Repository onboarding readiness is proven by the curated `onboarding` CI lane,
which uses a bounded process-local transport and writes only safe screenshots
and summarized JSON evidence. That green result proves application behavior,
the real migration/runtime-role boundary, and provider-neutral delivery
semantics. It does **not** prove that Resend or another external provider is
configured, that staging has received a message, or that production is ready.

Provider and environment acceptance are separate, ordered gates:

1. configure `OPENGENI_RESEND_API_KEY`, `OPENGENI_EMAIL_FROM`,
   `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `OPENGENI_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` through the
   environment's secret authority, never repository files or evidence;
2. in an explicitly authorized non-production environment, send an invitation
   through the configured provider and retain provider-side idempotency plus
   delivery evidence without retaining the setup bearer or rendered body;
3. prove the exact candidate in staging, including signup, verification,
   invitation setup, sign-in/password reset, initial shared grants, revocation,
   readiness, logs, and bounded alerts; and
4. promote or run production acceptance only under the repository's existing
   exact-candidate release authority and a fresh deployment authorization.

A merge, green repository CI run, local Docker result, or provider-free capture
must never be interpreted as authorization to mutate staging or production.

### Canonical organization-tenancy authority activation

Organization-tenancy activation follows the same maintenance shape, one
subsystem at a time. `docs/organization-tenancy.md` owns the boundary itself -
what is reversible before activation, what becomes forward-recovery-only after,
and the exact preconditions - and this section owns the operator procedure.

The named switch for declining or deferring the boundary is
`OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_TENANCY_CANONICAL_ACTIVATION_ENABLED`. It defaults to
`false` in both `.env.example` and the chart's `config` map, and leaving it at
`false` is the supported way to decline or defer activation indefinitely: the
deployment keeps the legacy workspace-owned lane and an image rollback stays an
ordinary deployment decision. Every rolling tenancy migration still applies
normally with the switch off.

Explicit embedding-host MCP connection authority has an independent rolling
admission switch: `OPENGENI_HOST_MCP_AUTHORITY_SOURCE_ADMISSION_ENABLED`
defaults to `false` in config and Helm. Deploy the new API, control worker, turn
worker, and web image everywhere with the switch false. Only after the complete
fleet has converged should a second rollout set it true and begin admitting
`authoritySource: "host"` connection refs. This prevents a new API from
persisting a discriminator that an old turn worker could reinterpret as native
connection authority. Host auth-needed events remain safe for cached old web
bundles: their legacy reason is unavailable/non-actionable, while new bundles
read the exact `hostReason` and host authorization URL. After marked refs
exist, never restart a pre-contract image; turning the switch off does not
remove, drain, or disable those durable refs. Upgraded readers, child
inheritance, and workers consume them regardless of their local switch value;
the switch gates only new external admission and static configuration.

Migration 0303 is intentionally rolling and applies while the switch remains
`false`; applying the ordinary migration chain does not activate an
organization. The switch is enforced by the separately invoked session-tenancy
activation command and by API/worker startup posture after the first durable
activation receipt exists. It is not a reversible feature flag: once any
organization is activated, every subsequently started API and worker must keep
the switch `true`, and a pre-0303 image or a new image with the switch disabled
fails closed.

Consequently, a normal local stack creates workspace-visible sessions and omits
the visibility chooser while Only me is unavailable. That is the expected
pre-activation posture, not a missing browser feature. Testing Only me requires
the same explicit version-1 activation receipt and enabled deployment switch
described below; do not seed the receipt through direct table DML.

The migration deliberately drops the legacy eight-argument visibility/fork
routines and exposes only nine-argument, activation-versioned routines with no
defaults. This is a drained protocol cutover, not an overload-compatible API:
an old caller fails with undefined-function, and operators must not add a
wrapper that supplies an activation version on its behalf.

Three tenancy cutovers have now used this maintenance shape, and a pre-0264,
pre-0275, or pre-0303 image must never be started again after its corresponding
activation:

- `0264_connection_authority_runtime_activation.sql` activated canonical
  Connection authority; and
- `0275_scheduled_connection_authority.sql` froze common-user Connection
  authority on scheduled-task revisions; and
- `0303_session_tenancy_product_activation.sql` installed the per-organization
  session-tenancy receipt plus hardened visibility/fork contract. Unlike the
  first two, applying 0303 is inert; the drained operator command performs the
  forward-only per-organization activation.

The first two migration files declare `-- deployment-mode: maintenance`; 0303
and 0340 install their contracts as rolling migrations but the separate
activation command is still a drained, forward-only cutover. Each activation
rejects a live application with SQLSTATE `55000` before taking `ACCESS
EXCLUSIVE` source-table locks, and no activated boundary has a down-migration.
For each subsequent activation:

1. bind and verify the exact production subscription, cluster context,
   namespace, release, database, and image digests;
2. prove the activation preconditions in
   [`organization-tenancy.md`](organization-tenancy.md#preconditions-for-permitting-an-activation)
   - completed membership, resource-classification, and final session-classifier
   receipts under fresh run keys, current counters from
   `bun run db:inventory-tenancy --organization-id <uuid>`, parity evidence,
   cross-organization/RLS evidence, and immediate-revocation evidence - and
   record that evidence in private operator storage before touching the cluster;
3. set `OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_TENANCY_CANONICAL_ACTIVATION_ENABLED=true` for the
   new image generation only. Never flip it on a running pre-activation
   generation as a way to "test" activation;
4. stop the API plus every control and turn worker while preserving the
   migration-only secret and Job identity;
5. query `pg_stat_activity` through the migration connection and prove zero
   other sessions with `usename = 'opengeni_app'`;
6. run the new digest's migration Job and require 0303, 0340, plus every prerequisite
   migration to appear in `schema_migrations`;
7. with the application still drained, run:

   ```bash
   OPENGENI_ORGANIZATION_TENANCY_CANONICAL_ACTIVATION_ENABLED=true \
   OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL='<migration-owner-url>' \
   OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES='opengeni_app' \
   bun run db:activate-session-tenancy -- \
     --organization-id <organization-uuid> \
     --activated-by '<bounded-operator-identity>'
   ```

   The command reruns the canonical inventory, parity, and backfill-evidence
   reports, retains and hashes the inventory snapshot, and requires every parity invariant plus each
   exact drainable/bounded activation lane to be zero. It deliberately does not
   gate on total ownerless sessions or all-time immutable legacy writer rows;
   migration 0298 supplies their truthful attributable and observation-window
   refinements. Migration 0340 also requires the newest
   `organization_memberships`, `sessions`, `variable_sets`, `rigs`, `machines`,
   and `connections` receipts to be completed, verifies full-population counts
   for the resource/session/connection classifiers, requires zero unresolved
   resource or connection rows, and binds those six exact receipt ids into every
   new activation row. It then recomputes inventory, parity, and receipt evidence
   under the complete source-table lock, checks the supplied exact application-
   role inventory twice around that fence, and is idempotent only for the same
   evidence digests. A stale or fabricated digest rejects with SQLSTATE `40001`.
   A live application session rejects activation with SQLSTATE `55000`; changed
   evidence against an existing receipt is a conflict. Immediately before the
   final recompute and receipt write, the database also takes the owner-only
   `session-tenancy-canonical-boundary:v1` transaction fence. This happens only
   after all source-table locks; do not move the boundary earlier, because future
   greenfield provisioning writes its complete graph before taking the same
   fence and the reversed order would deadlock.

   Migration 0349 implements that greenfield side. After at least one operator
   activation is committed, an ordinary eligible self-service signup
   automatically appends its version-1 activation receipt, deterministic
   greenfield evidence, and enabled private-session setting/event in the same
   transaction as its owner + Personal-workspace graph and setup receipt. There
   is no second operator command for that newly inserted organization. A signup
   that wins the boundary before the first committed witness stays unactivated,
   as do every 0348 adopted legacy account and all existing organizations; run
   this drained operator procedure for those organizations. Never hand-insert a
   greenfield evidence or activation row to bypass that distinction.

   Migration 0303 created `session_tenancy_activations` with `FORCE ROW LEVEL
   SECURITY` and a `FOR SELECT`-only policy, so under this exact
   non-superuser-owner posture the activation's own receipt `INSERT` was denied
   with SQLSTATE `42501` after every gate had already passed. Migration 0340
   re-opens that single command behind an owner-only marker policy; the runtime
   role keeps `SELECT` and nothing else, and the table has no `UPDATE` or
   `DELETE` writer at all. `packages/db/test/migration-0340-owner-migrated-tenancy-cutover.test.ts`
   commits a real receipt through this posture, so the cutover is executable end
   to end ([`force-rls-migration-backfills.md`](force-rls-migration-backfills.md)).
8. start only that same digest's API and workers, and require the startup and
   readiness posture checks to pass before reopening admission.

After the activation migration commits, rollback to an earlier application image
is forbidden, and setting the switch back to `false` is not a rollback - it
cannot restore the legacy authority. Remain in maintenance and fix forward.

For Azure managed Blob storage, the artifact generator can consume the
sensitive Terraform output `object_storage_azure_connection_string` into the
private `runtime.env` file. Keep the Terraform output JSON under `.agent/` or
another ignored private path.

Inspect required modes, variable-set variables, and checks:

```bash
bun run deployment:preflight -- --profile azure-existing-services
```

Run live connectivity probes against the current shell variable set and Kubernetes context:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig bun run deployment:preflight -- --profile azure-managed --live
```

Run API-level deployment conformance against a reachable OpenGeni API:

```bash
bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url https://opengeni.example.com
```

For deployments with the built-in shared-key boundary enabled, pass the same key
used by the backend. Conformance sends it as `x-opengeni-access-key`, verifies
that client config is secret-free, verifies protected routes reject missing
keys, discovers the workspace through `/v1/access/me`, and then exercises
workspace-scoped API/SSE requests:

```bash
OPENGENI_CONFORMANCE_DEPLOYMENT_ACCESS_KEY="$OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY" \
  bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url https://opengeni.example.com
```

For managed deployments, conformance should use an OpenGeni product API key for
the test workspace:

```bash
OPENGENI_CONFORMANCE_PRODUCT_TOKEN="$OPENGENI_TEST_WORKSPACE_API_KEY" \
  bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url https://staging.app.opengeni.ai
```

If the target reports deployment-key auth and no conformance deployment key is
provided, conformance fails instead of treating auth as a skipped check.

Managed SaaS operators should keep their release pipeline, live Stripe account
checks, staging/prod canaries, backup/restore drills, observability evidence,
and private deployment inventory in an operator-controlled private repository or
secret-managed CI system. The open-source repository intentionally provides the
reusable product, chart, Terraform roots, and conformance commands; it does not
ship Cloudgeni-specific operational release gates or live-account scripts.

Google Drive candidates also provide a provider-free, secret-safe configuration
receipt:

```bash
bun run deployment:google-drive-readiness
```

The command makes no provider, deployment, database, or Kubernetes call. It
checks the local runtime settings, emits the derived callback URL and numeric
budgets, and leaves declared source-security dependencies, human-approved
non-production provider acceptance, deployment, and production acceptance as
explicit blocking gates. The canonical configuration, retry, observability, and
acceptance contract is in `docs/google-drive.md`; the non-secret Helm overlay is
`deploy/helm/opengeni/values.google-drive-readiness.example.yaml`.

For private in-cluster Garage behind a local port-forward, keep the presigned URL host intact with curl's connect mapping:

```bash
bun run deployment:conformance -- \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --object-connect-to opengeni-garage:3900:127.0.0.1:19000
```

The object-storage check performs a browser-style `OPTIONS` preflight before
the signed `PUT`. Managed and external buckets must allow direct upload CORS
from `*` because the OpenGeni browser SDK is designed to run inside arbitrary
customer products, whose origins are not known to the OpenGeni operator. CORS
is transport policy, not upload authorization: the API first authenticates the
workspace request, then returns a short-lived, object-scoped signed URL. The
storage account/container remains private and browser PUTs carry no storage
credentials or cookies beyond that signed URL.

API CORS has a separate trust boundary. Public API requests are available from
any browser origin with explicit bearer credentials, so the SDK can be embedded
without per-application origin registration. `OPENGENI_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN_REGEX`
is only the allowlist for origins that may send browser cookies cross-origin.
Keep that regex narrow; unlisted origins receive wildcard, non-credentialed
CORS responses and therefore cannot use a managed-login session cookie.
Browser and desktop controller requests also admit the configured
`OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and `OPENGENI_WEB_BASE_URL` origins directly; this
does not grant those origins credentialed cross-origin responses.

The unauthenticated local development API (`OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE=local`
with the default `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT=local`) uses a stricter browser boundary
instead: no wildcard CORS, browser `Origin`s limited to its web origin, its own
address, and `OPENGENI_LOCAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and `Host` limited to this
computer's names and configured addresses. See
[local-development.md](local-development.md#start-the-full-stack). Managed and
configured access modes, and local access mode under any other
`OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENT` (such as the Helm examples), keep the policy above.

For Azure Blob, the blob-service CORS rule must allow origin `*`, method `PUT`
(plus `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` for the complete file flow), and all request
and exposed headers. S3/GCS equivalents must express the same wildcard-origin
contract. Do not add each embedding application to an origin allowlist.

For S3-compatible storage on a split network, keep
`OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` browser-reachable and set
`OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT` to the private address reachable
from the API and workers. Signed URLs retain the public host while authenticated
server-side completion checks and object operations use the internal address.
`OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_SANDBOX_ENDPOINT` is separate and only describes the
address reachable from agent sandboxes.

Do not treat a successful presign as storage acceptance. Release conformance
must exercise the provider-native `OPTIONS` + signed browser `PUT`, API finalize
(which performs authenticated `HEAD`), signed `GET`, and tenant-negative read.
The worker also registers one global `opengeni-file-upload-reaper` Temporal
Schedule. It retains unfinished uploads until the signed URL expires plus one
hour, claims at most 100 objects per run, retries a crashed/failed delete claim
after ten minutes, and settles the RLS row terminal only after the provider's
idempotent delete succeeds. A healthy rollout therefore needs the same worker
Temporal and object-storage access used by normal uploads; disabling or
skipping storage conformance leaves both upload and orphan cleanup unproven.

The conformance command verifies API health, Prometheus metrics exposure, a real session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and file upload/download unless the corresponding `--skip-observability`, `--skip-agent`, `--skip-scheduled-tasks`, or `--skip-storage` flag is set. Skipped checks are explicit verification gaps, not proof that the skipped subsystem works.

Profile the live API → NATS → Connected Machine → process → reply path with an
existing idle machine-backed session:

```bash
bun run deployment:connected-machine-load -- \
  --base-url https://opengeni.example.com \
  --workspace-id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  --session-id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  --stages 1,10,25,50,100,200
```

The command runs a harmless marker command, warms every supplied session route,
then applies a concurrency staircase. It reports request throughput, p50/p95/p99
latency, and typed failure counts. Before the first write, it reads one supplied
session to discover the target's `X-OpenGeni-Api-Contract` revision and sends
that revision on every terminal probe; older targets that do not advertise a
contract remain supported. Pass multiple `--session-id` values to spread the
test over several machine-backed sessions. Use
`--deployment-access-key` or `--product-token` only when the deployment enables
that boundary; neither credential is printed.

This test measures the Connected Machine control transport and host command
admission. It does **not** measure model-provider capacity, full agent-turn
memory, or useful development-task throughput. Use
`scripts/operator/turn-density-profile.ts` for isolated turn-worker memory, and
run a smaller representative set of real development tasks before choosing an
active-turn concurrency target. A large number of durable idle sessions is not
equivalent to the same number of simultaneously executing turns.

The density profile uses a scripted model and an in-process first-party MCP
endpoint, so it exercises turn setup without a model-provider key or the
deployment's user-facing access mode. It creates a run-scoped account and
workspace, removes both before exit, and prints one
`OPENGENI_DENSITY_RESULT=...` record for automation.

Run this profile only in a bounded non-serving execution class. A production
read-only forensic fingerprint over 3,823 sessions exited 137 in a 1 GiB serving
API pod; neither that forensic scan nor a density sweep may compete with API or
turn-worker serving memory. The release sweep is the exact
`1/2/4/8/12/16/24/32` density set with three waves. Boundary runs may select a
documented subset with `OPENGENI_DENSITY_SWEEP`, but must retain the artifact's
exact source revision, raw samples, cleanup proof, compaction-shrink proof, and
provider-isolation facts.

Direct file, Git, and synchronous terminal APIs follow a machine-targeted
session's active pointer from the first request. They use API → NATS → enrolled
agent request/reply and do not need a preceding model turn, a turn worker, or a
cloud-sandbox lease.

For Azure Blob-backed deployments, no object host rewrite should be needed because upload/download URLs are public Azure Blob SAS URLs:

```bash
bun run deployment:conformance -- \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --timeout-seconds 180
```

## Local Development Stack

`bun run dev` is the primary full local path. `OPENGENI_DEV_BACKEND=auto`
prefers Docker only when its daemon answers a bounded server probe, then falls
back to native PostgreSQL, NATS, Temporal, and Garage processes. Set
`OPENGENI_DEV_BACKEND=docker` or `native` to require one path. The native path
is Linux/WSL2-only (macOS uses Docker), changes a copied Docker sandbox default to the credentials-free
in-process local provider, and preserves explicit remote sandbox providers.
Fresh native storage defaults to Garage, while recorded or legacy MinIO state
retains MinIO. Incompatible provider changes fail before startup; there is no
automatic data migration. `bun run dev:check` checks the selected prerequisites
without starting services. `bun run dev:tools` prints the opt-in, project-local
pinned tool installation plan.

Both infrastructure paths run migrations, import the fingerprinted reviewed
integrations catalog, and start the API, control and turn workers, artifact
materializer, artifact outbox dispatcher, and web. Connected Machines is opt-in
for fresh local configuration; its relay is prepared before application startup
only when `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_ENABLED=true`.
Docker additionally builds the local sandbox image when that sandbox backend is
selected. The two artifact roles receive distinct generated least-privilege
database logins and independently selected health ports (defaults `9465` and
`9466`). Ignored local values, including the resolved infrastructure and
sandbox backends, are written to `.env.runtime`, not `.env`. Set
`OPENGENI_CATALOG_IMPORT_ENABLED=false` to omit the catalog import.

Artifact sidecars parse role-specific settings, not the API/agent runtime's full
configuration. Both retain environment/revision, telemetry and database-schema
settings. The outbox additionally consumes NATS settings (a configured control
user and password must be supplied together); the materializer consumes and
validates object-storage settings. Their dedicated database credentials remain
mandatory and never fall back to the application login. Sharing a ConfigMap that
selects managed access or a remote sandbox does not require sharing API signing,
email or sandbox-provider secrets with either sidecar. API and ordinary worker
authentication and provider validation are unchanged.

Native dependencies remain running after `Ctrl-C`, matching Compose's warm
restart behavior. `bun run dev:down` stops only the infrastructure recorded for
this worktree. `bun run dev:clean -- --yes` also removes its PostgreSQL/object
storage data and `.env.runtime`. On a mode-0700 sandbox repository mount, the
unprivileged PostgreSQL server stores its exact hashed project cluster under
`/var/tmp/opengeni-native-postgres`; clean removes that directory without
loosening repository permissions.

The script prepares one canonical current-host development artifact bundle only
when its exact source/toolchain fingerprint or native receipt is absent or
stale. On macOS the materializer runs as an explicitly opted-in unsandboxed
development subprocess, restricted to loopback PostgreSQL, object storage, and
HTTP health authority. Its health response advertises
`sandboxEnforced: false`. This mode is rejected under `NODE_ENV=production` and
cannot coexist with `OPENGENI_ARTIFACT_RUNTIME_MANIFEST`. Production artifact
materialization currently requires Linux with enforced `bwrap` + `prlimit`
isolation and fails closed on other hosts. The sandbox starts from an empty
filesystem namespace, mounts only the verified artifact runtime/executable and
system loader libraries, and proves CPU, memory, open-file, process-count, and
per-file-size ceilings before readiness. Helm projects only the selected
`artifactMaterializer` database/object-storage credential keys; it never imports
the shared runtime Secret wholesale.

For Kubernetes nodes that restrict nested user namespaces or mask `/proc`, the
materializer may require a pod user namespace in addition to its child sandbox:

```yaml
artifactMaterializer:
  hostUsers: false
  securityContext:
    procMount: Unmasked
    appArmorProfile:
      type: Localhost
      localhostProfile: artifact-materializer
```

This is an explicit deployment selection, not a portable default. Verify that
the Kubernetes version, container runtime, node kernel and filesystem support
pod user namespaces. Provision the named enforcing AppArmor profile on every
eligible node before scheduling; it must permit the child sandbox's user,
mount, PID and network namespace setup while preserving sensitive `/proc` and
`/sys` denials. Do not disable AppArmor globally or grant the container host
capabilities. The chart preserves non-root execution, dropped capabilities,
read-only root and `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`; the overlay above changes
only the listed fields. An unmasked proc mount is rejected unless `hostUsers`
is explicitly `false`. Leaving `hostUsers` null omits the field and retains the
existing cluster default.

User namespaces also separate the pod's host user-ID accounting: the child's
native process limit must not compete with unrelated containers sharing the
same numeric user ID. Treat a successful chart render as configuration proof
only. Before admitting the deployment, run the production launcher probe on
each selected node/runtime combination and prove `sandboxEnforced: true`,
private child networking, read-only child root, writable scratch, unchanged
native limits, and no parent mount authority. Exercise restart and replacement
node scheduling; a missing profile or unsupported user namespace must remain
a startup failure, not trigger an unsandboxed fallback.

When a common host port is already occupied, `bun run dev` auto-selects a nearby
free port and rewrites the in-memory runtime URLs for that run. Set
`OPENGENI_POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`, `OPENGENI_NATS_HOST_PORT`,
`OPENGENI_NATS_MONITOR_HOST_PORT`, `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_HOST_PORT`,
`OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_UI_HOST_PORT`, `OPENGENI_GARAGE_HOST_PORT`,
`OPENGENI_ARTIFACT_MATERIALIZER_HTTP_PORT`, or
`OPENGENI_ARTIFACT_OUTBOX_HTTP_PORT` in `.env` if you need fixed local choices.
MinIO uses `OPENGENI_MINIO_HOST_PORT` and
`OPENGENI_MINIO_CONSOLE_HOST_PORT`.

When the turn worker itself runs in a container and controls the host Docker
daemon through its socket, configure
`OPENGENI_DOCKER_WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR` to an absolute host directory and
bind-mount that directory into the worker at the exact same absolute path. The
Agents SDK materializes repositories, resources, and lazy-loaded skills in that
directory before the host daemon bind-mounts each workspace into its sandbox.
Without the shared-path identity, the worker and sandbox see different
filesystems even though Docker accepts the mount.

## Build Images

The production web image serves the built SPA through the repository-owned Bun
server, not Vite's preview server. The build precompresses text assets;
content-hashed `/assets/*` responses are served with immutable one-year caching,
while the HTML shell revalidates. Every shell response carries
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy:
strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (the setup-account page keeps its stricter
`no-referrer`). The server deliberately sets no `X-Frame-Options`,
`frame-ancestors`, or other CSP, because the console supports embedding. The
API compresses JSON responses and leaves SSE and other streaming transports
uncompressed.

The shell carries a meta description plus Open Graph and Twitter card tags so
shared console links unfurl with the bundled 1200x630 `/og-image.png`. Link
preview crawlers need an absolute image URL, and the static shell cannot know
its own origin, so the web server rewrites root-relative `og:image` and
`twitter:image` URLs against `OPENGENI_WEB_BASE_URL`, or
`OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when the console and API share an origin. The Helm
chart already hands the web pod the shared config map, so no extra setting is
needed. A split-origin deployment must set `OPENGENI_WEB_BASE_URL` to the
console origin: the `OPENGENI_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` fallback would point the image at
the API host, which does not serve it. Without either value the URL stays
relative: browsers accept it, but
some crawlers then show a preview without an image. The origin is never taken
from request headers. Top-level icon files (`/favicon.ico`, `/favicon.svg`,
`/apple-touch-icon.png`) ship with the shell, and any other missing top-level
file such as `/robots.txt` answers 404 instead of the SPA HTML.

The console's account menu links to product documentation under Help. The API
advertises the link in `/v1/config/client` as `documentationUrl`, defaulting to
the public OpenGeni docs at `https://docs.opengeni.ai`. Set
`OPENGENI_DOCUMENTATION_URL` on the API to an absolute http(s) URL for your own
documentation, or to `none` to hide the entry; any other value fails startup.

Web assets, the React demo, and the server bundle compile once on BuildKit's
native build platform. The amd64 and arm64 web images copy those portable
outputs into their respective Bun runtime images without executing target
architecture build steps. Web image publication therefore does not need QEMU.

Build local OpenGeni workload images:

```bash
bun run image:build:api
bun run image:build:worker
bun run image:build:web
```

Image builds default to `linux/amd64`, matching the Azure AKS reference node pool. Override with `OPENGENI_IMAGE_PLATFORM` for another target.

For production Helm releases, pin API, worker, web, and migration images by digest as well as tag. The chart renders images as `repository:tag@sha256:...` when `image.digest` is set, which keeps tags readable while making the deployed artifact immutable.

## Verified public release

Managed production npm packages are reconciled automatically by
`reconcile-production-packages.yml` every five minutes (GitHub scheduling may
delay a run). It reads the healthy production revision and that source's
immutable candidate package list, then dispatches the existing exact-source
`publish-packages.yml` when versions are missing. Publication is independent of
later live acceptance. This is an availability trigger: `/healthz` identifies
the serving API revision, not proof that every rollout replica is ready.
Failed publication retries on subsequent checks;
workflow failures remain visible in Actions. A short deployment-to-publication
gap is intentional; Site builds can fail during that gap. Full official release
publication and acceptance evidence remain separate.

`main` is the daily integration branch and remains GitHub's default branch.

Site authoring installs exact registry versions. Stable builds use their source
SDK/React/Codemode/ogtool manifest versions. Before a canary rollout, publish packages
from the same source using `publish-canary.yml`, then set
`OPENGENI_SITE_PACKAGE_VERSIONS` on the turn workers to the JSON from that run's
`site-package-versions-<sha>` artifact. The publisher runs from protected `main`
and admits an exact ancestor commit, so branch movement does not invalidate a
frozen candidate. Standard npm provenance identifies the trusted workflow
controller; the verified checkout and source-named receipt identify the package
source, which can be older. The runtime includes these pins beside
the Sites skill. Never use a mutable dist-tag as the deployment pin. Production
sandbox images do not include Site package archives; the local development
image helper alone enables `OPENGENI_LOCAL_SITE_PACKAGES=true` for unreleased work.

`production` is the official source pointer in this repository; it is not a
live-cluster deploy. Staging is a manual pin of already-baked
`canary-sha-<commit>` images from any `main` SHA
(`.github/workflows/staging-canary-dispatch.yml`). Merging `main` does not
auto-deploy staging. Promote with a GitHub PR base `production` / compare
`main` and **Create a merge commit** (never squash, never GitHub
rebase-and-merge). Hotfix via `hotfix/*` into `production`, then merge
`production` → `main`. Official cuts: dispatch `open-version-pr.yml` on `main`
(or `VERSION_PR_ON_PUSH=true`), merge that Version PR, promote, then
`workflow_dispatch` candidate/acceptance/publication. Official source ancestry
is `origin/production`. The `production` pointer already exists; do not
recreate it and do not force-push.

Protect `production`: no force-push; merge commits only (disable squash and
rebase-and-merge); required checks `Admit production PR head` and
`Current-base source admission` (skip-success aggregate so promote PRs from
live `main` stay mergeable). Drop `Current-base source admission` from the
`main` ruleset; Version PRs still receive that named check from trusted
`ci.yml` dispatch.

Merging a changesets Version PR only commits package versions and changelogs; it
does not publish packages or release images. It produces the versioned source
required by the manually dispatched `.github/workflows/release-candidate.yml`.
Once trusted CI admits the exact Version PR head and its generating `main` base,
later commits on `main` do not invalidate that run. The immutable head, its
single parent, deterministic version tree, automation identity, and retained
controller remain fenced; ordinary protected-branch movement is not a release
freeze. A regenerated Version PR head still supersedes and cancels CI for the
older head.

Ordinary candidate and operator admission bind the **merged associated PR**, not
a later GitHub `APPROVE` or structured PASS body on the exact head:

- the source SHA must be that PR's `merge_commit_sha`;
- reviewed base/head are the provider-retained `pull.base.sha` / `pull.head.sha`;
- trees, merge provenance, `opengeni-release-head-<head>` retention, and the
  required main CI jobs remain fail-closed;
- GitHub branch protection may still require a review to merge into `main`;
  that is a merge-time GitHub rule, not a second operator PASS check.

Do not recreate admission from a live review list, a review comment, a commit
message, or a local record. The ordinary operator still records identity fields
(`reviewed_base_sha`, `reviewed_head_sha`, PR URL, digest, reviewer login) on
the ledger; those are identity/digest, not a re-fetched GitHub PASS.

GitHub account identity remains authoritative by the provider's positive numeric
account ID plus account type (`User` or `Bot`) wherever merge provenance names
an actor. The provider login is an audit snapshot only; login spelling, case
normalization, or an account rename does not replace that stable identity.

Compute the ledger identity digest with the exact provider-retained PR base SHA
from the pull-request detail (`pull.base.sha`) as `--base`; this is the
reviewed-base identity that the release verifier reconstructs, not the latest
SHA currently at the tip of protected `main`:

```bash
bun scripts/release-review.ts \
  --base <exact-provider-retained-pull.base.sha> \
  --head <exact-reviewed-pr-head-sha> \
  --reviewer <trusted-maintainer-login>

bun scripts/release-review.ts \
  --base <exact-provider-retained-pull.base.sha> \
  --head <exact-reviewed-pr-head-sha> \
  --reviewer <trusted-maintainer-login> \
  --digest
```

Regenerate the digest when the candidate head or its provider-retained
`pull.base.sha` (the verifier's exact accepted reviewed-base identity) changes.
Ordinary protected
`main` movement is not itself a candidate update and must not trigger a source
merge/rebase. Separately, let the merge authority refresh latest-current-main
mergeability and material-compatibility evidence on the same candidate head;
that evidence is not `reviewedBaseSha` and does not require replacing the
identity digest or mutating the candidate. Do not merge or rebase `main` into the source branch solely to refresh
evidence.

GitHub check lookup is ref-sensitive: a checked head can become undiscoverable
after its source branch is deleted or rewritten even though the check itself
ran successfully. Release-capable heads are therefore retained before merge at
the immutable lightweight tag
`opengeni-release-head-<exact-reviewed-head-sha>`. Trusted Version-PR CI creates
that tag before it creates the exact-head check runs. For a non-Version PR that
will be used directly as a release source, dispatch
`.github/workflows/seal-release-head.yml` from exact current `main` with the PR
number and exact base/head SHAs before merging. The base-owned workflow reruns
the complete source-admission verifier, requires the existing successful
exact-head admission check, then creates or verifies the tag idempotently. It
also publishes a prerelease named `Retained OpenGeni release head <sha>` for
that exact tag. Repository-level immutable releases must be enabled: the
provider response must identify the GitHub Actions bot as author and report the
published prerelease as `immutable: true`, or sealing fails closed. GitHub then
locks the tag and emits its native release attestation.

If a seal fails before merge or is interrupted and the reviewed PR has since
merged, dispatch the same workflow from current `main` with `merged_source_sha`
set to the exact accepted PR merge source. Before its first mutation, recovery
reconstructs the complete historical base-to-head tree/file admission, proves
the original PR base/head/merge and tree, proves the merged source's ancestry
into current `main`, and reads the retained tag/release as one paired state. It
accepts either an unchanged GitHub Actions-owned immutable pair or a pair that
is still completely absent through the pre-mutation fence. In the absent case,
there must also be no pre-existing retention check; recovery then creates the
exact tag and immutable prerelease before restoring checks. A partial pair,
preclaimed check, non-404 provider read error, identity drift, or evidence
movement fails before mutation. A create conflict or provider error is never
normalized or followed by takeover of the competing state. Recovery pins the
first provider read's PR-author numeric ID/account type and exact head
branch/repository across its pre-mutation and terminal reads; it supports both
Version and explicitly sealed non-Version release PRs without substituting a
hard-coded author or branch. Successful replay reuses the exact immutable pair
and always upserts one deterministic historical source-admission receipt before
restoring retention. Original pull-request workflow checks are historical
evidence only: a normal draft-to-ready lifecycle may leave more than one, while
the deterministic recovery receipt remains unique and authoritative.

Before the first seal, a repository administrator must enable the provider
feature with the API version that introduced its management endpoint:

```bash
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" \
  repos/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni/immutable-releases
gh api \
  --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" \
  repos/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni/immutable-releases \
  --jq '.enabled'
```

The verification command must print `true`. Enablement affects releases created
after it is switched on, so a mutable failed bootstrap release cannot be
promoted into evidence; push and seal a fresh exact head instead. Treat that
first fresh seal as an activation test: use a low-risk documentation-only PR,
then re-read its exact tag, immutable prerelease, native attestation, and
provider-owned retention check before relying on the mechanism for release
source.

Once the complete tag/immutable-release/PR identity has been re-read without
drift, the workflow idempotently publishes a successful
`Release-head retention` check on the exact head with external identity
`opengeni:release-automation:release-head-retention:v2:pr:<number>:head:<sha>:release-sha256:<digest>`.
The digest binds the publicly readable immutable release identity. An
anonymous downstream operator can therefore re-read the exact tag and release,
require `immutable: true`, and reconstruct the check identity without receiving
a cross-repository credential. Consumers may additionally verify GitHub's
cryptographically signed release attestation with `gh release verify`.
Its byte contract is SHA-256 over newline-free UTF-8 `JSON.stringify` of this
object with the top-level keys sorted in ascending ASCII order:

```json
{
  "authorId": 41898282,
  "authorLogin": "github-actions[bot]",
  "authorType": "Bot",
  "draft": false,
  "id": 123,
  "immutable": true,
  "name": "Retained OpenGeni release head <sha>",
  "prerelease": true,
  "publishedAt": "2026-07-27T02:00:00.000Z",
  "tagName": "opengeni-release-head-<sha>",
  "url": "https://github.com/Cloudgeni-ai/opengeni/releases/tag/opengeni-release-head-<sha>"
}
```

`id` is the live positive release ID and `publishedAt` is the provider
`published_at` value normalized through `new Date(value).toISOString()`. If an
existing release differs from this identity after a retention check exists,
sealing fails rather than creating a second proof; publish and seal a fresh
exact head. Do not rebase an unchanged candidate solely because `main` moved.
The live immutable-release author is authenticated by numeric account ID and
account type. `authorLogin` remains the canonical contract snapshot shown above
so existing v2 retention-check digests and release manifests remain
byte-compatible when GitHub normalizes or renames the same bot login; no schema
or evidence migration is required. A different author ID or account type still
fails closed.
Trusted Version-PR admission publishes the same check. This gives downstream
release operators a provider-owned proof of immutable source retention without
requiring a credential that crosses repository boundaries. A tag and immutable
prerelease are retention evidence, not a GitHub review PASS. Later source,
candidate, and acceptance gates remain mandatory. A missing, moved,
indirect, mutable, non-provider-authored, or post-hoc substitute outside the
fenced merged-source recovery above fails release provenance. Retained-head
prereleases and their tags intentionally accumulate for the lifetime of their
release evidence; never include them in routine release or tag cleanup.

Release admission derives the merge outcome exclusively from GitHub records; a
workflow caller cannot assert a merge method. The exact current `main` SHA is
fenced before and after admission, must be associated with exactly one merged
PR, and must retain the PR's provider-recorded base, head, merge SHA, actors,
commit count, and exact reviewed-head tree. A matching GitHub `merged` timeline
event must independently bind the source commit, merge actor, and merge time;
association and topology alone do not admit a direct fast-forward push.
Supported provider-derived outcomes are:

- an exact two-parent merge commit with parents `[reviewed base, reviewed head]`;
- an exact one-commit squash on the reviewed base when the PR had multiple
  commits;
- an exact linear multi-commit rebase from the reviewed base with the same
  provider commit count as the PR; and
- a one-commit squash/rebase equivalence class when both the PR and rewritten
  result contain one commit.

GitHub does not retain a distinct manual UI method field for that final
one-commit case. Admission therefore records the truthful equivalence class
rather than guessing from mutable commit text or accepting caller metadata.
Both possible operations have the same admitted security identity: one exact PR,
base, head, reviewed tree, source tree, and provider merge SHA. Any nonlinear or
discontinuous range fails closed.

The exact reviewed head must still resolve directly from its canonical
`opengeni-release-head-<sha>` tag and have one successful GitHub Actions
`Current-base source admission` check. Version PRs receive that named check
from trusted `ci.yml` dispatch. The `source-admission.yml` workflow is
hotfix-into-production only; its required-check name stays on a skip-success
report job so promote PRs from live `main` remain mergeable. GitHub loads a
`pull_request_target` workflow from protected default-branch `main`, even when
the PR base is `production`. That controller therefore validates its real
default-branch workflow identity, reads the production base SHA from the exact
pull-request event, fetches and hash-pins the verifier from that immutable event
base, and invokes it with an explicit base-owned workflow context. The check
admits the immutable provider event head against
the PR's provider merge-base tree; it does not require the event base to equal
continuously moving `main`. The base-owned helper SHA must remain in protected
`production` ancestry for hotfix admission, and the provider base/head/repository,
direct tree manifest, file projection, helper digest, read-only permissions,
and terminal head identity remain fail-closed. The merge authority separately performs the fresh latest-main
conflict, canonical patch-equivalence, protected-path, generated/migration,
identity/manifest, security, and evidence checks immediately before merge.

Do not enable or leave auto-merge armed on a generated Version PR until trusted
CI on that exact head is green. Immediately before merge, re-read `baseRefOid`,
`headRefOid`, `state`, and `autoMergeRequest` from the PR. Require the PR to
remain open and auto-merge to remain null, then merge with an exact head-SHA
fence. Never rely on an earlier UI observation for this boundary. Ordinary
candidate/operator admission does not re-read GitHub reviews after merge.

The exact source must separately have one successful GitHub Actions result for
each required candidate check:
`Typecheck and unit tests`, `Deployment artifacts`, and `Workload image
builds`. Missing, moved, indirect, duplicated, failed, wrong-head, or
foreign-app evidence is rejected. Check history is read with `filter=all`, and
every accepted record must bind the exact commit and the official GitHub
Actions app identity (`github-actions`, app ID `15368`). This admission
metadata does not alter the reproducible schema-v2 candidate receipt or any
chart, manifest, SBOM, provenance, or workload digest.

That workflow requires the exact current `main` source SHA, an immutable
`opengeni-release-head-<sha>` controller equal to the Version PR's trusted base,
and no pending changesets. Trusted Version CI retains that base before its
candidate checks can succeed. Dispatch the
workflow from that retained controller tag and pass the release source only as
data. The complete job graph, reusable admission gate, and local publication
actions therefore come from reviewed controller bytes. Every job that checks
out or executes candidate source depends on the read-only gate, which
reconstructs the provider-owned merge, merged-source identity, retention, and
required-check evidence. When GitHub squashes the immutable reviewed head after
protected `main` advances, the gate accepts only a single-parent source whose
complete parent-to-source Git-tree delta is byte-for-byte identical to the
reviewed base-to-head delta and whose integration parent retains that reviewed
base as an ancestor. An overlapping, truncated, extra, missing, or otherwise
unproved composition fails before candidate source runs or candidate bytes
exist. Acceptance, embedded
distribution, and final publication all require that same controller SHA and
revalidate its direct tag, immutable provider release, and successful admission
job before trusting the candidate artifact.
It derives every unpublished publishable workspace package directly from the
exact checkout and npm registry, so a caller-maintained list cannot omit a
package. It builds API, worker, web, relay, and stock headless-sandbox images
under fresh run-and-attempt-scoped candidate tags. Migrations explicitly reuse
the API manifest. The official BOM does **not** include `opengeni-desktop`.
Modal Computer/Browser need `docker/desktop.Dockerfile` (Xvfb/XFCE/Chrome/browserd),
published by `.github/workflows/publish-desktop-image.yml` to
`opengenipublicneuacr.azurecr.io/opengeni-desktop:preview-<source-sha>`.
The publisher uses the existing `public-release` OIDC identity, verifies the tag's
immutable digest and source label after registry logout, pulls anonymously, and
runs the installed artifact runtime doctor while rejecting `.unavailable`.
The workflow retains publication evidence; its legacy GHCR `sha-<source-sha>` and
`canary-sha-<source-sha>` tags are best-effort mirrors in a separate bounded,
error-tolerant job, not publication gates.
Dispatch builds the selected ref's exact SHA; dispatch merged main deliberately.
Publication does not update deployment pins or rotate existing sandboxes. OpenGeni defaults to
a public, digest-pinned desktop image in both runtime config and Helm. Override
Helm `desktop.imageRef` only with another compatible digest
(`registry/opengeni-desktop@sha256:…`). The chart fails closed when
`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=modal` and `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_DESKTOP_ENABLED=true`
without a valid digest pin. Do not point Modal at official `opengeni-sandbox`.
A pin change applies to **new** sandbox creates;
rotate or reap the warm lease before an existing session can use the new box.
Protected main CI uses the separate `canary-sha-<source>` namespace for its
SHA-configured images and records that tag in the canary receipt. The
release-owned `sha-<source>` namespace therefore remains available for the
accepted product-version manifests even when the two build configurations
produce different digests from the same source tree. Every protected-main
canary and release-candidate workload image carries
`org.opencontainers.image.revision=<exact source SHA>` and the repository's
`org.opencontainers.image.source` label; inspect those labels together with the
immutable digest when diagnosing a deployed image.
Each attempt refuses pre-existing run-scoped tags and builds the complete image
set from scratch. A retry receives a different tag, so an interrupted attempt's
partial registry state can never be mistaken for the next attempt's output.
Before acceptance, the same workflow packages the Helm chart twice through the
deterministic release packager, requires byte-for-byte equality, and freezes the
resulting `.tgz` and SHA-256 in the candidate Actions artifact. It does **not**
occupy the official OCI version yet. The immutable GitHub release tag
`opengeni-candidate-<full-source-sha>` retains `release-candidate.json`, its
SHA-256 sidecar, and the chart assets. Retries that fail before this immutable
boundary rebuild under a fresh attempt tag and regenerate the same deterministic
chart bytes; once the candidate release exists, the workflow refuses to rerun
because its producer run-attempt binding is itself immutable. Release admission
must use the original successful candidate run ID instead of trying to rewrite
that release.

The public OCI location is a release authority, not a hard-coded provider.
`OPENGENI_RELEASE_OCI_PREFIX` is a registry host plus an optional repository
namespace (default `ghcr.io/cloudgeni-ai`). `OPENGENI_RELEASE_REGISTRY_AUTH`
selects either built-in `github` auth for that default host or `azure-oidc` for
an Azure Container Registry. The Azure mode accepts only an `*.azurecr.io`
host, uses the environment-scoped `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and
`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` variables, pins the Azure actions and CLI version, and
mints a short-lived data-plane token; no registry password is stored.
Federated credentials must bind the exact `public-release`,
`embedded-release`, and `production-release` GitHub environments, and the
workload identity must have the narrow push role on the selected registry.

Whichever registry is selected must permit anonymous pulls. Candidate creation
logs out before it writes a receipt and proves all seven image digests through
the unauthenticated path. Embedded and final promotion repeat that proof for
the published image aliases and chart bytes. A private or inconsistently
configured registry therefore fails closed before becoming distribution
authority. The candidate receipt records the full image repository names, and
every later workflow verifies them against the same source-controlled prefix.
Each official workload image is one OCI index containing both `linux/amd64`
and `linux/arm64`; candidate creation builds both variants before freezing the
index digest, so downstream hosts select their native architecture without
building OpenGeni locally.

For the default GHCR location, the owning organization must allow public
package creation and each existing `opengeni-*` container package must be made
public once in its package settings. GitHub does not expose package visibility
as a REST mutation, so release workflows must not attempt to change it. The
manual `verify-public-container-packages.yml` audit and the candidate,
embedded, and final anonymous-pull gates verify the resulting configuration.

Self-hosted embedding consumers have a narrower distribution boundary:
`.github/workflows/release-embedded.yml` publishes only an exact versioned
source that already has an immutable candidate receipt from the canonical
candidate workflow. It is dispatched from the same retained controller tag and
executes registry authentication, receipt validation, package closure checks,
manifest reconciliation, and BOM construction from that controller checkout;
the versioned source remains data. Candidate provenance and receipt bytes are
verified before installing that source's dependencies or allowing any source
lifecycle script to run. Its dispatcher supplies the trusted candidate run ID, not a
caller-selected receipt URL or digest. The workflow re-runs the public package
gates, verifies npm `gitHead` and integrity, publishes or reconciles the exact
candidate chart, promotes the receipt's unchanged manifests to version and
full-source-SHA tags, and writes one source-bound package/image/chart BOM. It
also retains the candidate's verified amd64/arm64 native artifact-runtime inputs
as `opengeni-artifact-runtime-<full-source-sha>.tgz` with a portable SHA-256
sidecar. Source builders can therefore reproduce API, worker, materializer, and
sandbox images after the short-lived Actions artifact expires without weakening
the runtime integrity chain or rebuilding foreign-architecture binaries.
It deliberately does not create or update `latest`, and its immutable distribution
receipt makes no hosted Workbench, staging, production, or canary claim.

An application-only embedded release additionally supplies the exact source SHA
and successful run ID of the canonical `publish-packages.yml` workflow whose
owned, unexpired `package-publication-verified-*` artifact defines the package
overlay. OpenGeni verifies that run and provider artifact digest, requires the
run to have executed from `main`, retains the exact controller branch and SHA in
the new provenance evidence, and proves that controller SHA remains an ancestor
of current `main` before any release mutation. The package source SHA remains a
separate identity. OpenGeni then requires the receipt to cover the exact
publishable package-name closure and re-reads every recorded version from npm to
match its immutable `gitHead` and SHA-512 integrity before using the receipt's
complete BOM. It publishes zero npm packages in this mode. This permits reviewed
application/chart/image bytes to pair with a newer coherent package publication
without floating to registry `latest`, inventing source ownership, or attempting
to publish superseded package versions.

After staging and production have consumed those exact
digests and chart bytes, the protected operator-controlled
`.github/workflows/release-acceptance.yml` workflow produces the sanitized
schema-v2 acceptance bundle. Its `production-acceptance` environment is the
canonical acceptance boundary. Dispatch it from the same retained controller
tag as the candidate: the accepted source is checked out only as data, while
the workflow graph, provenance verifiers, and bundle assembler are executed
from the exact controller bytes. That environment pins the operator repository
and canonical workflow path and holds a narrow artifact-read credential. A
dispatcher supplies only the operator run ID: OpenGeni requires a successful
`workflow_dispatch` run from the configured operator `main`, proves that run's
head remains on `main`, resolves exactly one unexpired source-SHA-named artifact
and its provider digest, and accepts only the two expected sanitized files.
OpenGeni then replaces all operator-supplied candidate/public-producer authority
with its independently verified candidate and current acceptance-run metadata
before validating every schema-v2 row. A 72-hour production soak row is
optional evidence, not a publish gate; when present it is still bound to the
same source tree, exact chart bytes, and complete API/migration/worker/web/relay/
sandbox digest map as candidate, staging, and production. Acceptance requires
the accepted source to remain an ancestor of current `production`, but does not
require it to remain the current tip: compatible reviewed work can continue to
merge to `main` during an official train without freezing daily integration or
invalidating an otherwise unchanged proven train. No
dispatcher can select an evidence URL, hash, repository, workflow path, or
artifact name.

Cloud-hosted operators must keep the corresponding private release ledger
equally exact: staging and production use the candidate artifacts with
`rebuild:false`; every required role is deployed; stale Helm, hotfix, and source
metadata is truthfully rewritten or cleared; and any rollback target is bound to
its source, tree, chart, and image digests and independently known safe. These
provider inventory details remain in operator-controlled evidence rather than
the sanitized public bundle, but they are mandatory dependencies of acceptance.

Public release is then an explicit dispatch of `.github/workflows/release.yml`
from the same retained controller tag. The accepted source SHA remains an
explicit input and checkout, never workflow authority. Evidence admission accepts the
candidate and acceptance **run IDs**, not caller-controlled URLs, hashes,
workflow paths, or repository identities. The provenance verifier queries the
GitHub API and requires the canonical repository/workflow, a completed
successful `workflow_dispatch` run from the exact retained controller tag,
exact source commit/tree SHA and run attempt, the controller's direct immutable
tag/release, the candidate run's one successful admission job, and one owned unexpired Actions
artifact with its provider digest and expected artifact name. URLs and archive
digests are derived only after those checks. This final read-only admission
requires the accepted source to remain reachable from `main`, but deliberately
does not require it to remain the newest `main` commit after a staging soak.
The
exact package set is carried from the immutable candidate receipt and
re-derived from registry state immediately before publication; the dispatch
caller cannot add or omit packages. An explicit zero-gap confirmation is still required. The product
release identity comes from the exact SemVer `version`/`appVersion` pair
committed in `deploy/helm/opengeni/Chart.yaml`; it is independent of whichever
npm packages changed. The selected dispatch ref and workflow graph must identify
the exact retained controller, while `source_sha`, the source checkout, and a
commit reachable from `main` must identify the same release-data revision.
Candidate admission rejects a product version already occupied by any official
image or chart. A final-release retry permits only aliases that already resolve
to the exact accepted digest.

The dispatch downloads the validated candidate and acceptance artifacts,
verifies their provider ZIP digests and retained sidecars, rejects any changed,
missing, or extra image role, requires migration to equal API, requires the
candidate/staging/production chart version and packaged-byte hash to match, and
validates every machine-readable contract row
before re-running the package typecheck, builds, SDK parity test, and publish
closure guard. Before touching npm it rejects any unlisted unpublished package,
rejects local version drift or an occupied version from another git source, and
retains a pre-publication plan. Afterward it requires every expected registry
entry to bind the accepted source through `gitHead` and a SHA-512 integrity value
before release image aliases can be promoted. That reconciliation also makes an
interrupted post-publication run safely resumable. The final
`verified-release-receipt-<sha>` binds the source, trusted producer provenance,
candidate/acceptance artifact identities, accepted chart bytes, registry identities,
and complete publishable package inventory. The final job is protected by the
`production-release` environment, compares any existing immutable BOM before
mutating version, full-SHA, or `latest` aliases, then verifies every alias and
the anonymous OCI chart pull against the accepted bytes. The final job publishes
or reconciles that exact accepted archive under the official chart version,
records its resulting OCI manifest digest in the BOM, and never rebuilds an
image or repackages the chart after acceptance.

The workflow emits `release-bom-<sha>` containing one deterministic
`release-bom.json`: exact
source SHA, release version, every publishable package version plus npm `gitHead`
and SHA-512 integrity, every release image's immutable SHA-256 digest, and the
official chart reference/version, OCI manifest digest, exact `.tgz` byte hash,
and artifact name. Hosts should consume this BOM as one unit and reject missing,
extra, mutable-tag-only, or version-mismatched components. The same bytes and a
SHA-256 sidecar are published once on the immutable GitHub release tag
`opengeni-release-<full-source-sha>`; a retry compares the existing public assets
byte for byte and fails instead of overwriting them. No moving BOM alias is
created. Ordinary pushes to `main` can open/update the Version PR but cannot
publish.

The stock sandbox remains a separate workload image. The embedded public release
binds its exact native artifact-runtime inputs to the same source SHA. Verify and
extract that release asset so it creates `.release/artifact-runtime`, then build
all source images only with that bundle:

```bash
sha256sum --check "opengeni-artifact-runtime-${SOURCE_SHA}.tgz.sha256"
tar -xzf "opengeni-artifact-runtime-${SOURCE_SHA}.tgz" -C .release

docker build \
  --build-arg OPENGENI_SERVER_VERSION="${SOURCE_SHA:0:12}" \
  -f docker/opengeni.Dockerfile \
  --target api \
  -t opengeni-api:local-"${SOURCE_SHA:0:12}" \
  .

docker build \
  --build-arg OPENGENI_SOURCE_SHA="$SOURCE_SHA" \
  -f docker/sandbox.Dockerfile \
  -t opengeni-sandbox:local-"${SOURCE_SHA:0:12}" \
  .

docker build \
  --build-arg OPENGENI_SOURCE_SHA="$SOURCE_SHA" \
  -f docker/desktop.Dockerfile \
  -t opengeni-desktop:local-"${SOURCE_SHA:0:12}" \
  .
```

Set `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_ARTIFACT_RUNTIME_ENABLED=true` only with a digest-pinned
stock image that actually contains `/opt/opengeni/artifact-runtime/installation.json`.
That is `docker/sandbox.Dockerfile` for Docker and `docker/desktop.Dockerfile` for
Modal Computer/Browser. Do not enable the flag on a desktop digest published
before the kernel was installed, and do not point Modal at headless
`opengeni-sandbox` to obtain the kernel.
Production Docker/Modal references must be digest-pinned; sandbox environment, mutable,
self-hosted, and mismatched images fail closed. The worker runs the absolute
runtime doctor inside the actual box before the model starts. `bun run dev`
automatically caches an exact clean-HEAD CI runtime when available, source-tags
the local image, and otherwise leaves only standalone sandbox-local Office file
operations disabled unless `OPENGENI_REQUIRE_SANDBOX_ARTIFACT_RUNTIME=1`
requests a hard failure. Collaborative artifact skills are independent: the
worker admits them from the exact frozen first-party tool catalog.

The Connected Machine stream relay is a separate deployed component built from
the `agent/` Cargo workspace. It is only needed when Connected Machines are
enabled (see [Connected Machines](#connected-machines)):

```bash
docker build -f agent/crates/opengeni-relay/Dockerfile -t opengeni-relay agent
```

For production Helm releases that enable Connected Machines, pin the
`opengeni-relay` image by digest as well as tag, the same way API, worker, web,
and migration images are pinned.

## Helm

For chart changes that need testing before a stable distribution release, manually
dispatch `publish-canary-chart.yml` from protected `main`, supplying that exact
40-character `source_sha`. It publishes only a run-scoped prerelease chart and
retains the source SHA, archive hash and verified OCI digest in its receipt.
It does not publish packages or images, qualify runtime behavior, deploy a cluster,
or move stable tags. Consumers must separately select and verify immutable runtime
images and package compatibility. Use the returned chart version and digest;
do not infer successful publication from the source merge or a workflow dispatch.

Released OpenGeni charts are published as public OCI artifacts. The immutable
release BOM is authoritative for the chart reference and manifest digest. For
release installs, use that `chart.reference` and pin the chart version
explicitly; the release pipeline packages the chart with `appVersion` set to
the same OpenGeni version, and the default image tags resolve to that
appVersion:

```bash
OPENGENI_VERSION="<published-version>"
OPENGENI_CHART_OCI="<release-bom chart.reference>"

helm upgrade --install opengeni "$OPENGENI_CHART_OCI" \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --create-namespace \
  --version "$OPENGENI_VERSION" \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

Use the repo checkout chart path only for development, chart edits, local
rendering, or smoke tests against locally built images. `deploy/helm/opengeni`
keeps the canonical product release identity in the exact SemVer
`version`/`appVersion` pair in `Chart.yaml`; bump both together before producing
a candidate for a new product release, even when no npm package changed. If you
install from a clone instead of the OCI chart, set `api.image.tag`,
`worker.image.tag`, `web.image.tag`, `migrations.image.tag`, and, when enabled,
`relay.image.tag` to the image tag you intend to run.

Render the development chart path with an existing secret:

```bash
helm template opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --set global.imageRegistry=REGISTRY.example.com \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

For production NATS, use an existing endpoint or the official NATS chart and pass the resulting URL through `nats.url` or `OPENGENI_NATS_URL`. The chart-owned NATS template is only a disposable fixture for local and smoke verification:

```bash
helm template opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --set nats.enabled=true \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

For a self-contained Kubernetes smoke deployment, enable the optional dependency primitives:

```bash
helm template opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --set postgres.enabled=true \
  --set temporal.enabled=true \
  --set nats.enabled=true \
  --set garage.enabled=true \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

For local Kubernetes parity testing, build local images and install the same chart into the local cluster:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f docker/opengeni.Dockerfile --target api -t opengeni-api:local-k8s .
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f docker/opengeni.Dockerfile --target worker -t opengeni-worker:local-k8s .
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f docker/opengeni.Dockerfile --target web -t opengeni-web:local-k8s .
kind load docker-image opengeni-api:local-k8s opengeni-worker:local-k8s opengeni-web:local-k8s --name "${KIND_CLUSTER_NAME:-opengeni-local}"

export OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY="${OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY:?set OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY for local shared-key auth}"
kubectl create namespace opengeni-local --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl -n opengeni-local create secret generic opengeni-runtime-local-k8s \
  --from-literal=OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY="$OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

helm upgrade --install opengeni-local deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni-local \
  --values deploy/helm/opengeni/values.local-kubernetes.example.yaml
```

Then run conformance through port-forwards:

```bash
kubectl -n opengeni-local port-forward svc/opengeni-local-api 28080:8000
kubectl -n opengeni-local port-forward svc/opengeni-local-garage 29000:3900

OPENGENI_CONFORMANCE_ACCESS_KEY="$OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY" \
  bun run deployment:conformance -- \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:28080 \
  --object-connect-to opengeni-local-garage:3900:127.0.0.1:29000
```

The chart defaults API, worker, and web deployments to zero-surge rolling updates (`maxSurge: 0`, `maxUnavailable: 1`) so one-node smoke clusters do not need spare node capacity during upgrades. Increase surge settings in larger production clusters if you want faster replacement and have capacity headroom.

The in-cluster Postgres, Temporal, NATS, and Garage/MinIO templates are disposable conformance fixtures for local Kubernetes, CI, and smoke verification. They are not lightweight production alternatives or the production distribution of those systems. Production operators should use managed services, existing customer endpoints, or official upstream charts/operators, and provider-native object storage through the runtime secret.

Production self-hosted platform dependencies should use mature upstream projects rather than OpenGeni-owned replicas of those systems:

- NATS: official NATS Helm chart, or an existing managed/customer NATS endpoint.
- Temporal: Temporal Cloud, an existing customer endpoint, or the official Temporal Helm chart connected to external persistence.
- Postgres: managed cloud Postgres, an existing customer database, or a production PostgreSQL operator such as CloudNativePG.
- Secrets: External Secrets Operator with Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Vault, or an equivalent store.
- TLS: cert-manager, cloud load balancer certificate integration, or an existing ingress/TLS stack.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry Collector/Operator plus Prometheus Operator-compatible resources, exported to a self-hosted LGTM-compatible stack or a managed cloud backend.

The OpenGeni Helm chart owns OpenGeni API, web, worker, migrations, optional Terraform Registry MCP docs service, and integration resources such as `ServiceMonitor`, `PrometheusRule`, `ExternalSecret`, and workload NetworkPolicies. It must not become a replacement chart for NATS, Temporal, Postgres, cert-manager, or the observability platform.

The stack wrapper may install upstream charts as a convenience layer. That
keeps lifecycle commands visible and reversible without making those charts
OpenGeni chart dependencies.

### Shared Prometheus and Grafana distribution

`deploy/observability` is the optional public observability wrapper. It pins
`kube-prometheus-stack` exactly, provisions persistent Prometheus,
Alertmanager, and Grafana defaults, and renders the canonical dashboard
ConfigMaps directly from `deploy/observability/dashboards`. The dashboard JSON
therefore has one source for self-hosted and managed installations; environment
overlays add ingress, credentials, alert receivers, remote-write targets, and
environment-only rules without copying the canonical boards.

Print the ordered install plan with:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability -- --profile single-node
```

On a cluster that explicitly selects `sandbox.backend=opensandbox`, use
`--opensandbox`. The additional values overlay enables kube-state-metrics for
the pinned `Pool` CRD plus a `ServiceMonitor` for the controller metrics
Service. The OpenGeni control worker separately projects BatchSandbox and
workload-Pod state into fixed-label aggregate gauges through namespace-scoped,
list-only Kubernetes RBAC. The base wrapper leaves this optional integration
off, so clusters without OpenSandbox CRDs retain the prior monitoring behavior.

The wrapper plan installs only the monitoring platform; it never reconciles
OpenGeni workloads and never runs application hooks. After it is ready, include
`deploy/observability/opengeni.values.example.yaml` in the next ordinary
application release using that release's exact chart version and complete
authoritative values. The application chart deliberately renders
`ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` only after the Prometheus Operator CRDs
exist. Both the wrapper's Prometheus selectors and the application integration
resources use
`opengeni.ai/monitoring=enabled`; the same label is required on the application
and observability namespaces, limiting cross-namespace discovery. Grafana reads
dashboard ConfigMaps only in the wrapper namespace through
`grafana_dashboard=1` and the `grafana_folder` annotation; its dashboard sidecar
does not watch Secrets or every namespace.

The default profile is a persistent, non-HA single-node stack. The committed
production example increases retention, storage, and resources and requires an
existing Grafana administrator Secret, but it is not a substitute for an
environment-specific storage, backup, HA, ingress, and alert-routing review.
Clusters that already run a compatible monitoring platform can set
`kube-prometheus-stack.enabled=false` and consume only the canonical dashboard
ConfigMaps and application integration labels.

After installation, run the live receipt:

```bash
bun run deployment:observability-verify -- \
  --namespace observability \
  --release opengeni-observability \
  --app-namespace opengeni
```

The receipt binds dashboard bytes to their hashes and source revision, checks
the application monitoring resources, confirms required rules through the live
Prometheus API, requires healthy discovered targets for every OpenGeni
`ServiceMonitor`, and verifies Grafana health plus the dashboard provisioner
files. Existing Kubernetes monitoring platforms can pass explicit Prometheus
and Grafana URLs plus the Grafana pod selector, sidecar container, namespace,
and dashboard directory. `--skip-live-apis` is only an object-level diagnostic
and leaves an explicit consumption gap. Full values, security, capacity,
existing-platform, upgrade, and uninstall guidance lives in
`deploy/observability/README.md`.

For managed cloud profiles, the generated stack plan includes:

- upstream NATS from `https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts`, release
  `opengeni-nats` in namespace `opengeni-platform`;
- upstream Temporal from `https://go.temporal.io/helm-charts`, release
  `opengeni-temporal` in namespace `opengeni-platform`;
- `deploy/stacks/opengeni-platform-networkpolicies.yaml`, which keeps those
  ClusterIP services limited to OpenGeni API/worker pods when the cluster CNI
  enforces Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`;
- runtime endpoints wired as `nats://opengeni-nats.opengeni-platform.svc.cluster.local:4222`
  and `opengeni-temporal-frontend.opengeni-platform.svc.cluster.local:7233`.

Temporal still needs durable persistence. The committed example upstream
Temporal values file at
`deploy/stacks/official-temporal-postgres.values.example.yaml` documents the
shape, but stack runs should generate a private values file under
`.agent/generated/` instead of editing the example:

```bash
TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_HOST="$(terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp output -raw postgres_host)" \
  bun run deployment:temporal-values -- \
  --out .agent/generated/official-temporal-postgres.values.yaml
```

The generator writes no database password. By default it uses the managed
Postgres admin user `opengeni` and asks the upstream Temporal schema jobs to
create/manage the `temporal` and `temporal_visibility` databases. Create a
Kubernetes Secret named `opengeni-temporal-postgres` in `opengeni-platform`
with that user's password. Keep that database server and secret outside the
OpenGeni app chart lifecycle.
Use `TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_CONNECT_ADDR=host:port` instead of
`TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_HOST` when the provider-specific connection endpoint already
includes a port or needs a proxy-local address.

Some managed PostgreSQL services require encrypted connections. For AWS RDS,
the managed stack wrapper downloads the AWS RDS global CA bundle into
`.agent/generated/<profile>/`, creates a private `opengeni-postgres-ca`
ConfigMap in `opengeni-platform`, and generates Temporal SQL TLS settings with:

```bash
TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_TLS_ENABLED=true
TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_TLS_CA_FILE=/etc/opengeni/postgres-ca/ca.pem
TEMPORAL_POSTGRES_TLS_CA_CONFIG_MAP_NAME=opengeni-postgres-ca
```

Use an encrypted OpenGeni application database URL for the same service, for
example `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL=postgres://.../opengeni?sslmode=require` for AWS
RDS. If a different provider or customer database requires a custom CA, mount
that CA through a private ConfigMap/Secret before running
`bun run deployment:temporal-values`. That database-to-Temporal-server TLS is
separate from the OpenGeni-to-Temporal client settings below.

After the upstream Temporal chart is running, the stack wrapper applies
`deploy/stacks/official-temporal-namespace-job.yaml` to register the Temporal
namespace used by OpenGeni (`default` by default). The OpenGeni worker cannot
poll task queues until that Temporal namespace exists.

Use this boundary when building a production cluster:

| Capability    | Production source                                                                                                                 | OpenGeni wiring                                                                                            |

The runtime secret must provide values such as:

- `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL`
- `OPENGENI_RUNTIME_DATABASE_ROLE=opengeni_app` for standalone FORCE-RLS deployments (the default)
- `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_HOST`
- `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_API_KEY` for Temporal Cloud; it enables TLS automatically
- `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_ENABLED=true` for server-auth TLS without an API key
- optional `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_NAME`, `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`, and the paired `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` / `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` for custom SNI, CA roots, or mTLS; any of these TLS materials also enables TLS
- `OPENGENI_NATS_URL` when not using in-cluster NATS
- `OPENGENI_STARTUP_DEPENDENCY_RETRY_*` when dependencies need longer startup windows
- optional `OPENGENI_WORKSPACE_CONTROL_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` (positive integer milliseconds, default `20000`): how long one HTTP-originated session/workspace mutation may wait to enter the workspace control prefix before the API answers the retryable 503 `WORKSPACE_CONTROL_BUSY`; the API validates it at boot and worker settlement never uses it. `generateRuntimeArtifacts` carries it into `runtime.env` only when set
- `OPENGENI_OPENAI_API_KEY` or Azure OpenAI equivalents
- optional `OPENGENI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the deployment-managed reviewed
  OpenRouter rail; keep it in the runtime Secret, never catalog JSON
- optional `OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=code|database` (default `code`),
  `OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON`, and `OPENGENI_MODEL_NOTES_JSON`
- `OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3-compatible` plus endpoint/access-key settings for local/self-contained modes
- `OPENGENI_OBJECT_STORAGE_BACKEND=azure-blob` plus Azure Blob connection string/account-key settings

- `OPENGENI_VERIFIED_SIGNUP_TRIAL_CREDITS_ENABLED=false` keeps the one-time $10 verified first self-service signup grant off. Activating it affects only new setup receipts, never existing users, invitations, or a later organization. It is the master opt-in; the database runtime switch from migration 0521 can pause and resume grants without a deploy or restart (see "Verified signup trial runtime switch (0521)" above). The grant is account-wide and may pay any OpenGeni-credit resource; no payment card is required. A completed in-flight resource can leave a negative balance, and future top-ups clear that balance first; no card is automatically charged. While the grant leaves a positive balance, new work that names no model defaults to `OPENGENI_CREDITS_DEFAULT_MODEL` (unless a saved workspace default or connected subscription wins), and the post-signup model step shows the balance; at zero or below it falls back to the deployment default. See "Default model for new work" in [`model-providers.md`](model-providers.md).
- `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_WARM_BILLING_MODE=usage_only|shadow|credits` and `OPENGENI_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDING_BILLING_MODE=usage_only|shadow|credits` are independent of Stripe and default to `usage_only`. `shadow` is operator-only comparison, never a customer debit. Paid sandbox mode additionally needs a reviewed backend warm rate in `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_WARM_RATE_MICROS_PER_SECOND_JSON`; paid deployment-funded embeddings need `OPENGENI_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDING_RATE_MICROS_PER_MILLION_BYTES` (integer USD micros per million input UTF-8 bytes) and `OPENGENI_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDING_CREDITS_ACTIVATED_AT` (ISO UTC timestamp; earlier queued jobs stay unpriced). This PR leaves commercial rates and production activation unset.
- `OPENGENI_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` and `OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY` only when using the optional deployment shared-key boundary
- `OPENGENI_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, trusted origins, public base URL, Resend key, and delegation secret when `OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE=managed`
- optional paired `OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `OPENGENI_MANAGED_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` for managed social sign-in
- `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (base64, exactly 32 bytes; generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`) for workspace variable sets; required when `OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE=managed` outside local/test, optional otherwise (variable set routes return 503 until it is set). See `docs/variable-sets.md`.
- Workspace-owned Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter keys are entered by workspace
  admins and encrypted under `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; do not put
  those keys in Helm values, catalog JSON, or the deployment runtime Secret.
- `OPENGENI_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, publishable key, webhook secret, and model pricing JSON when `OPENGENI_BILLING_MODE=stripe`; model pricing is also required when `OPENGENI_USAGE_LIMITS_MODE=managed` and any credits model lacks a reviewed built-in price
- sandbox backend credentials when required

Do not commit real secret values.

When `OPENGENI_BILLING_MODE=stripe`, point the Stripe webhook endpoint at
`/v1/webhooks/stripe` and subscribe it to exactly these events (or `*`):

```text
checkout.session.completed
checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded
checkout.session.async_payment_failed
checkout.session.expired
payment_intent.succeeded
payment_intent.payment_failed
payment_intent.canceled

```

Credits are granted only once Stripe reports the Checkout payment `paid`: at
`checkout.session.completed` for immediate payment methods, or at
`checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` for delayed ones. Checkout Sessions
without OpenGeni metadata (another product sharing the Stripe account) and
OpenGeni sessions for an account this deployment does not hold (another
OpenGeni deployment sharing the account) are acknowledged and ignored.

### MCP OAuth and tool-gateway posture cutover (0404-0405)

The same drained rollout procedure below applies to
`0418_site_direct_uploads.sql`: it adds the exact upload-table/RLS/grant inventory,
allows hash-free HTML versions and optional source, and widens stored byte counts.
Stop old API and both worker roles, supply the complete runtime login list,
migrate, provision the target roles, then start the matching binary. After this
cutover, do not restart a pre-0417 binary. Existing Site versions and source remain
readable; local development data does not need resetting.

Migrations `0404_mcp_oauth_authorization_server.sql` and
`0405_tool_gateway_approval_capabilities.sql` change the exact application-role
table, grant, and RLS inventory. The previous API/worker runtime-posture
evaluator rejects the provisioned target schema, while the target evaluator
rejects the old schema. This is therefore a single drained, forward-only
maintenance rollout; it is not safe to let the normal Helm pre-upgrade Job run
while old application pods still serve traffic.

1. Bind the exact database, schema, release artifacts, and every API/control
   worker/turn worker database login. Set
   `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` to the complete
   comma-separated old/new login list (normally `opengeni_app`). During a role
   rotation, include both identities. This list is drain detection only; it is
   not a grant allow-list. `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_USER` and its password name
   the sole target role that `db:provision-roles` grants after migration.
2. Bind the drain and final upgrade to the same immutable API/worker/web and
   migrations images. For a generated Kubernetes plan, set:

   ```bash
   export OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0404_mcp_oauth_authorization_server
   export OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_PREFLIGHT_CONFIRMED=true
   ```

   Do not set the confirmation until the release/database/login binding,
   accepted-turn handling, and exact image digests have been reviewed. The
   generated plan emits the migrations-disabled application drain only with
   both values present.
3. Stop every API, control worker, and turn worker using the target database and
   prove that every listed old/new login has zero other sessions in
   `pg_stat_activity`. Keep the application stopped through migration, role
   provisioning, and posture assertion.
4. From the exact new image, run the ordinary rollout gate in this order:

   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate
   bun run db:provision-roles
   bun run db:assert-runtime-posture
   ```

   Migration 0404 and migration 0405 each validate the explicit role list and
   repeat the live-session check after installing their schema. A live listed
   identity aborts with SQLSTATE `55000` and rolls back that migration. Both
   migrations remove every explicit non-owner ACL inherited from owner default
   privileges; they grant none of the listed drain identities. Only the
   following role-provision step grants the exact current target role.
5. Require both migration receipts in `schema_migrations`, then start only the
   same new image generation and require startup/readiness posture checks before
   reopening admission. `OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED` may remain false; feature
   enablement is independent of the mandatory schema/posture cutover.

After either migration commits, do not restart a pre-0404 application image or
attempt a mixed-version rolling rollback. Keep the application drained and fix
forward on the target schema.

### Deployment database model catalog cutover

The default source remains the reviewed code/env catalog. Database mode is an
operator-owned singleton, not a boot-time reconciliation loop. Migration 0389
changes the exact runtime-posture table/grant contract, so this is a drained
maintenance cutover rather than a rolling migration. A mixed pre/post-0389
fleet is unsupported even while every process still uses `code`:

1. Bind and verify the exact database, schema, new application image, and every
   API/worker database login. Set
   `OPENGENI_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_DATABASE_ROLES` to that complete comma-separated
   login list (normally `opengeni_app`). This list is only the maintenance-drain
   detector; it is not a runtime grant allow-list. During role rotation it may
   contain both old and new logins, while the exact
   `OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_USER` and password identify the sole target role that
   `db:provision-roles` grants after migration.
2. Stop every API, control worker, and turn worker, then prove no configured
   application login remains in `pg_stat_activity`. Do not rely on the normal
   Helm pre-upgrade hook while old pods still serve traffic: after 0387 commits,
   their repeated runtime-posture readiness check fails.

   For the bundled Helm chart, perform the drain as a migrations-disabled Helm
   revision using the same new chart, exact `sha256:` API/worker/web/migrations
   image digests, and values that the final upgrade will use. Mutable tags and
   registry cache state are not acceptable evidence across this drain boundary.
   The generated `local-kubernetes` plan is the sole tag-based exception: before
   draining, it builds all three images, derives one content identity from their
   Docker image IDs, loads those exact tags into kind, and persists the tag for
   both the drain and final Helm revisions.

   The generated deployment plan emits this drain only when both of these
   operator acknowledgements are present:

   ```bash
   export OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_CUTOVER=0389_model_catalog_and_gateway_custom_models
   export OPENGENI_DEPLOYMENT_MAINTENANCE_PREFLIGHT_CONFIRMED=true
   ```

   Do not set the confirmation until the exact release/database/login binding,
   accepted-turn handling, and no-live-application-session checks above are
   complete. Ordinary plans omit the drain and retain rolling availability.

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install "$RELEASE" deploy/helm/opengeni \
     --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --values "$VALUES" \
     --set api.enabled=false \
     --set worker.enabled=false \
     --set web.enabled=false \
     --set relay.enabled=false \
     --set artifactMaterializer.enabled=false \
     --set artifactOutboxDispatcher.enabled=false \
     --set terraformMcp.enabled=false \
     --set migrations.enabled=false \
     --wait --timeout 15m

   if kubectl -n "$NAMESPACE" get pods \
     -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=$RELEASE,app.kubernetes.io/component in (api,worker-control,worker-turns,artifact-materializer,artifact-outbox-dispatcher,relay,web,terraform-mcp)" \
     -o name | grep -q .; then
     kubectl -n "$NAMESPACE" wait --for=delete pod \
       -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=$RELEASE,app.kubernetes.io/component in (api,worker-control,worker-turns,artifact-materializer,artifact-outbox-dispatcher,relay,web,terraform-mcp)" \
       --timeout=10m
   fi
   ```

   Verify the application Deployments are absent and the configured database
   login has zero sessions. Then run the ordinary upgrade with those disable
   overrides removed; its pre-upgrade Job applies pending migrations through
   0387 before Helm recreates the application. Generated maintenance plans make
   this final upgrade atomic and clean up newly created resources on failure.
   Its rollback target is the immediately preceding new-chart, exact-image,
   migrations-disabled revision above, so a failed post-migration rollout
   restores the drained state without starting pre-migration application bytes.
   Remain drained and fix forward.

3. Apply `0389_model_catalog_and_gateway_custom_models.sql`, provision roles,
   and assert runtime posture using the catalog-aware release artifacts. The
   migration repeats the configured-login drain check before and after schema
   installation and aborts with SQLSTATE `55000` if a listed session is live.
   The migration strips inherited non-owner ACLs from the new tables and grants
   none of the listed drain identities; the following `db:provision-roles` step
   grants only the exact current application role.
   After commit, never restart a pre-0389 image or use it as an application
   rollback target; remain on the new schema and fix forward.
4. Start the catalog-aware API and workers with
   `OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=code`, then verify startup and readiness.
5. Prepare a strict, secret-free schema-v1 JSON document that is semantically
   equivalent to the active code/env catalog. Set `defaultModel` explicitly to
   the product ID that new sessions should use; omission retains the schema-v1
   compatibility behavior of choosing the first `builtInModels` entry.
   Membership and optional one-line notes belong in the document; keys, enabled
   flags, billing, cost policy, and pricing do not.
6. Validate and upsert it with a migration/admin database credential. Run the
   command from the catalog-aware release environment with the exact runtime
   model provider, credential, cost-policy, and pricing variables present; the
   database variables shown below are additions, not a complete environment:

   ```bash
   OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' \
     OPENGENI_DB_SCHEMA='opengeni' \
     bun run model-catalog:upsert -- --file ./model-catalog.json --expected-version 0
   ```

   Omit `OPENGENI_DB_SCHEMA` for the default `public` schema. Set it to the
   same dedicated schema used by migration and runtime connections for embedded
   deployments; the command validates it and uses the canonical
   `<schema>,opengeni_private,public` search path.

   `--expected-version` is mandatory compare-and-swap protection. Use `0` only
   when the singleton must not exist yet; for later changes, pass the exact
   version reported by the previous successful command. A mismatch makes no
   database change. The command uses transaction-local lock and statement
   timeouts so a competing operator cannot block it indefinitely. Before the
   write transaction, it applies the candidate to the same database-mode
   deployment settings and secret bindings used by runtime and validates the
   fully resolved executable catalog. Provider transport/credential, default
   model, and cost/pricing failures therefore leave the live singleton intact.

7. Confirm the command reports the expected version, then roll every API,
   control worker, and turn worker with
   `OPENGENI_MODEL_CATALOG_SOURCE=database` while the document remains
   equivalent to code mode.
8. Verify `/v1/config/client`, one authenticated workspace model catalog, a
   model picker, and the `list_models` tool after the whole fleet converges.
9. Only then add database-only membership. Before removing membership, changing
   an executable model definition, or changing a product's `free`/`credits`
   classification, drain or fence queued and active accepted turns that still
   name the affected product. Executable-definition drift fails closed rather
   than switching providers; workspace-facing cost is a separate live
   deployment policy and therefore must not change underneath accepted turns.
   A full maintenance window that stops catalog consumers is the simpler
   alternative.

Database mode fails closed when the singleton is missing or invalid and never
falls back to code. After the maintenance cutover, rollback is limited to the
catalog-aware binary with the source flag restored to `code`; that makes the
singleton inert but leaves it available for inspection or correction. Catalog
cost remains separately controlled by `OPENGENI_MODEL_COST_POLICY_JSON`; a
model marked `credits` needs `OPENGENI_MODEL_PRICING_JSON` under managed
billing/limits when no built-in price exists. Database mode allows cost-policy
and pricing entries to be staged before the corresponding product ID is added
to the singleton; code mode continues to reject unknown cost-policy IDs.

An authenticated database `registryProviders` entry must name a provider that
is also declared in host `OPENGENI_MODEL_PROVIDERS_JSON`. Its provider kind,
base URL, and wire API/profile must exactly match the host declaration. Default
headers/query and their public-name classifications are forbidden in the
database document and inherited only from the host declaration, alongside the
credential. The database document controls model membership and labels. Any
transport mismatch fails closed instead of forwarding a host credential to a
database-selected endpoint.

Workspace custom Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter slugs are not part of this
singleton. They are provider-qualified admin-managed rows protected by FORCE
RLS, overlaid only for that workspace, and become selectable only when the
matching encrypted workspace provider connection and workspace policy are
ready. The table is bounded to 100 active rows and 1,000 retained generations
per provider and workspace. If a deployment catalog later claims the same
provider/upstream slug, the reviewed deployment entry wins and the colliding
custom row is omitted from executable membership. Removing a custom slug
retires its row: it disappears from new selection, while already accepted turns
and existing-session continuations may still resolve the frozen definition.
Re-adding the same slug creates a fresh generation without rewriting the
retired execution authority.

### Optional OpenSandbox Kubernetes provider

OpenSandbox is an additive provisioned backend; production Modal behavior and
defaults are unchanged. It is installed only when a Kubernetes deployment
contract explicitly selects `sandbox.backend=opensandbox`. The stack wrapper:

- downloads exact upstream source commit
  `88004c989e334ffd7811acbe193cddcd9014f14e` and verifies the source, CRD,
  deterministic chart, and image digests from
  `deploy/stacks/opensandbox-source.lock`;
- installs the official upstream controller/server chart into
  `opensandbox-system`, with sandbox CRs and Pods in `opensandbox`;
- enables the controller's native metrics endpoint and installs a private
  `opensandbox-controller-metrics` ClusterIP Service;
- keeps the lifecycle service `ClusterIP`-only and loads its API key from the
  `opensandbox-api-key` Secret;
- enables the ClusterIP ingress gateway in URI mode with OSEP-0011 signed
  endpoints for Channel B (browserd, noVNC, ttyd). Exec and files stay on the
  private lifecycle server-proxy. Put a TLS terminator in front of that ClusterIP
  in production; do not fork the upstream Service to LoadBalancer;
- stores signing keys in the `opensandbox-secure-access` Secret (`keys` +
  `active-key`), never in git or the server ConfigMap. Official server
  `v0.2.2` ignores `OPENSANDBOX_SECURE_ACCESS_*`; the image post-renderer
  adds an initContainer that materializes `[ingress.secure_access]` into a
  writable runtime TOML from that Secret;
- Helm 3 can `helm upgrade --post-renderer scripts/operator/opensandbox-image-post-renderer.sh`.
  Helm 4 treats `--post-renderer` as a plugin name, so render with
  `helm template ... | scripts/operator/opensandbox-image-post-renderer.sh | kubectl apply -f -`;
- mounts a generic BatchSandbox template, or the Azure-specific variant that
  selects/tolerates the dedicated sandbox node pool.

Required runtime values are:

```bash
OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=opensandbox
OPENGENI_OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY=...
OPENGENI_OPENSANDBOX_IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/opengeni-sandbox@sha256:...
```

The platform plan supplies
`OPENGENI_OPENSANDBOX_BASE_URL=http://opensandbox-server.opensandbox-system.svc.cluster.local`.
`OPENGENI_OPENSANDBOX_TTL_SECONDS` defaults to 3,600 seconds and is renewed only
while the matching authoritative OpenGeni lease remains warm. OpenGeni idle
reaping is primary; provider expiry is a leak backstop.

OpenSandbox v1 uses exact ID-addressed attach and OpenGeni portable
`/workspace` tar capture/hydration. Tar bytes live in object storage; the lease
keeps the SHA-256 descriptor plus an object ref. Object storage is required when
this backend is active: missing storage fails closed at boot and on capture rather
than writing tar bytes into `resume_state`. Native OpenSandbox pause/resume,
snapshots, and immutable sandbox environment-image builds are deliberately not used. A desktop-class box
image (ttyd, browserd, Xvfb/XFCE/noVNC) reports PTY, desktop, and recording;
interactive keystrokes go through ttyd on 7681, not SDK `write_stdin`. Channel B
JSON and streams use signed URI-mode ingress when
`OPENGENI_OPENSANDBOX_SIGNED_ENDPOINTS=true`. That flag defaults off so ClusterIP-only
operators keep the lifecycle `/proxy/` path, in-box curl, and API frame-proxy.
Signed mode never falls back to those compensations. Prove Channel B signed HTTP
Bearer passthrough and WebSocket subprotocol preservation with
`bun run deployment:opensandbox-signed-endpoint-proof` against the preview ClusterIP
lifecycle + ingress port-forwards. The script writes a redacted JSON artifact and
must not log signatures or browserd tokens. The
Agents SDK still does not expose `write_stdin` because OpenSandbox command TTY
is unsupported; OpenGeni's internal finalizer can still poll and Ctrl-C an
exact retained provider command. `runAs` remains unavailable.

Prepare/render the pinned upstream chart without cluster mutation. Helm 3
accepts `--post-renderer <script>`. Helm 4 treats that flag as a plugin name,
so pipe the template through the script:

```bash
scripts/operator/prepare-opensandbox-chart.sh .agent/generated/opensandbox
kubectl -n opensandbox-system create configmap opensandbox-secure-access-runtime-config \
  --from-file=materialize-secure-access-config.py=scripts/operator/opensandbox-materialize-secure-access-config.py \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
helm template opensandbox .agent/generated/opensandbox/opensandbox-0.2.0.tgz \
  --namespace opensandbox-system \
  --values deploy/stacks/official-opensandbox.values.yaml \
  | scripts/operator/opensandbox-image-post-renderer.sh
```

When the optional observability wrapper is used, install it after the
OpenSandbox CRDs and metrics Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/stacks/opensandbox-controller-metrics-service.yaml
bun run deployment:observability -- --profile single-node --opensandbox
```

The OpenGeni `PrometheusRule` then adds backend-fenced alerts for create and
warming failures, Pool depletion, Pending and unschedulable workload Pods,
immutable-image pull failures, controller reconcile/readiness/restarts,
provider and controller Kubernetes-API 429s, TTL-renewal failures, stuck
deletion finalizers, and BatchSandboxes surviving their provider expiry.
Per-workload thresholds use fresh fixed-label aggregates from the control
worker. Raw BatchSandbox, workload-Pod, and container series in the
`opensandbox` namespace are dropped before TSDB ingestion; opaque lifecycle IDs
stay in correlated worker logs and are not metric labels.

For the custom-Kubernetes portability path, `deploy/stacks/k3s-source.lock`
pins the installer, checksum manifests, and amd64/arm64 binaries for k3s
`v1.36.1+k3s1`. On a fresh Linux VM, copy the repository checkout and run:

```bash
sudo scripts/operator/bootstrap-opensandbox-k3s.sh
```

The script verifies every downloaded byte before installation, disables only
the bundled Traefik component, waits for Kubernetes readiness, and writes a
root-only kubeconfig. `scripts/operator/destroy-opensandbox-k3s.sh` removes the
k3s installation; isolated preview automation should still delete the entire
VM resource group afterward.

The Azure reference module exposes `sandbox_node_pool`, disabled by default. An
enabled pool uses label `opengeni.ai/sandbox-pool=opensandbox`, taint
`opengeni.ai/sandbox=true:NoSchedule`, and explicit autoscaling bounds including
scale-to-zero. Size 5/50/500 profiles from CPU, memory, pod/IP density, daemon
overhead, utilization, disruption margin, quota, and cost; a 500 lightweight
profile is not evidence for 500 desktop sandbox environments. An Azure deployment that selects
OpenSandbox must enable this pool because its Azure BatchSandbox template pins
workloads to that scheduling contract. Generic Kubernetes and k3s use the
unconstrained template instead.

Keep `OPENGENI_MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL` and
`OPENGENI_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD` out of the runtime Secret. Put them in a
separate migration-only Secret referenced by `migrations.secret.existingSecret`.

OpenGeni's storage package intentionally exposes a small provider-neutral boundary instead of calling provider SDKs directly from routes. The current shipped backends are `s3-compatible`, `azure-blob`, `aws-s3`, and `gcs`; sandbox file resources are emitted as native storage mounts when the sandbox backend supports them, or materialized through short-lived signed downloads when a backend cannot mount that provider directly. Additional providers should be added behind the same boundary, or bridged through a library such as `files-sdk` if that becomes the lowest-maintenance adapter layer.

Sandbox file mount support is also backend-specific:

| Sandbox backend                     | S3-compatible          | Azure Blob                      | AWS S3                          | GCS                             |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker/local in-container sandboxes | rclone mount           | rclone mount                    | signed download materialization | signed download materialization |
| Modal                               | SDK cloud bucket mount | signed download materialization | signed download materialization | signed download materialization |

## Terraform Registry MCP Docs

The Helm chart can deploy an optional, cluster-internal HashiCorp Terraform MCP
server for authoritative Terraform Registry documentation:

```bash
helm upgrade --install opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --set terraformMcp.enabled=true \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

This renders a `ClusterIP` service at
`http://<fullname>-terraform-mcp:8080/mcp`. For a release named `opengeni`, the
default service name is `opengeni-terraform-mcp`. Register it in
`OPENGENI_MCP_SERVERS`, for example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "terraform-registry",
    "name": "Terraform Registry Docs",
    "url": "http://opengeni-terraform-mcp:8080/mcp",
    "cacheToolsList": true
  }
]
```

Then select it per session with an explicit tool reference such as
`{"kind":"mcp","id":"terraform-registry"}`. The chart does not wire a Terraform
Enterprise token or other provider credential into this server; it is a
registry-docs endpoint only.

## Connected Machines

A Connected Machine is a user-owned computer (a laptop, workstation, or server,
including macOS) enrolled as a first-class primary compute backend
(`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=selfhosted`). When a session turn targets a Connected
Machine, the platform establishes the machine session directly and routes tool
execution to the agent running on that machine over a NATS request/reply control
plane. No cloud sandbox box is created for that turn, no platform-minted GitHub
token is distributed to the machine (it uses its own local git credentials), and
repositories are not cloned onto it by the platform; the working directory is
chosen per session.

This is a separate, optional deployment surface. It is gated OFF by default;
existing deployments are completely unaffected unless an operator enables it.

### Enable flag

The whole feature is gated by `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_ENABLED` (default
`false`). While it is off, the enrollment routes return `404` — the surface does
not exist for the deployment — and the `selfhosted` backend is inert.

### Components to deploy

Enabling Connected Machines adds two net-new deployed components plus their
ingress and secret wiring:

- **Stream relay** (`opengeni-relay` image): a stateless wss byte-pump that
  splices the agent's producer stream and the viewer's consumer stream for a
  channel (pty/desktop). Enable with `relay.enabled=true`; the chart then renders
  the relay Deployment, Service, HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, NetworkPolicy, and,
  when observability is on, a ServiceMonitor. With the default
  `relay.metricsPort` it also renders an internal ClusterIP
  `<release>-relay-metrics` Service for Prometheus. The relay holds no cluster
  state and makes no cluster egress; both the agent and the viewer dial IN
  through the ingress. Route only `/stream` and `/healthz` of the relay host to
  it.
- **NATS with auth-callout**: the machine's agent dials a NATS websocket to reach
  the request/reply control plane, authenticated per workspace by a NATS
  auth-callout responder. Use chart-managed NATS with
  `nats.authCallout.enabled=true` for the single-machine profile and
  preview/smoke stacks, or fold the same `deploy/nats/auth-callout.conf` config
  into an external multi-node NATS deployment (`nats.enabled=false`).

Both the relay and the NATS websocket need public wss ingress hosts (for example
`relay.<domain>` and `nats.<domain>`) with the long-lived-stream ingress
annotations (read/send timeouts of at least `3600` seconds, buffering off). Flip
`selfhosted.enabled=true` together with `relay.enabled=true` and the NATS
callout.

### Ingress channel affinity

The relay pairs a channel's producer and consumer in a per-replica in-memory
registry, so both dials for a given channel must reach the SAME relay replica.
When running more than one relay replica behind an L7 ingress, configure the
ingress to route both dials for a channel to the same backend (consistent-hash or
session affinity keyed on the channel); otherwise a producer and consumer can
land on different replicas and never pair.

### Runtime-secret keys

Set these in the runtime secret (never a committed values file) when enabling
Connected Machines:

- `OPENGENI_STREAM_TOKEN_SECRET` — HMAC the relay verifies the viewer (`ogs_`)
  stream token with.
- `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_RELAY_TOKEN_SECRET` — HMAC the relay verifies the agent
  (`ogr_`) producer token with; may be omitted to reuse
  `OPENGENI_STREAM_TOKEN_SECRET` for both planes.
- `OPENGENI_ENROLLMENT_SIGNING_SECRET` — HMAC the control plane signs the
  enrollment bearer with (falls back to `OPENGENI_DELEGATION_SECRET`).
- `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_CALLOUT_ACCOUNT_SEED`,
  `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_CALLOUT_PUBLIC_KEY`,
  `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_CONTROL_PASSWORD`, and
  `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_CALLOUT_PASSWORD` — the NATS auth-callout account
  seed/public key and the control/callout logins.

Non-secret wiring goes in config/values: `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_URL` and
`OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_RELAY_URL` (the public wss URLs the agent dials, matching the
ingress hosts; both are returned to the agent as connect info at enrollment)
plus the callout account/user names. The relay process itself listens on
`OPENGENI_RELAY_BIND`, and serves `GET /metrics` only on
`OPENGENI_RELAY_METRICS_BIND` when that is set (see Service endpoints below).
The relay's non-secret tuning
knobs are `OPENGENI_RELAY_RING_FRAMES`, `OPENGENI_RELAY_SPLICE_BUFFER`,
`OPENGENI_RELAY_RATE_BURST_BYTES`, `OPENGENI_RELAY_RATE_BYTES_PER_SEC`, and
`OPENGENI_RELAY_PAIR_TIMEOUT_SECS`. A missing token secret makes the relay reject
every connection (fail-closed).

### Agent binary distribution

The machine agent is served from the control plane itself. The API exposes the
install script and the per-deploy agent binary at auth-exempt paths
(`/install.sh`, `/install.ps1`, `/uninstall.sh`, and `/agent/*`), so
`curl -fsSL https://<host>/install.sh | sh` installs the exact agent build that
matches the running control plane (the per-SHA binary baked into the API image),
and the served script defaults enrollment to that same public origin. A configured
`OPENGENI_API_URL` still overrides it, so this works with no dependency on an
external CDN. A public release archive is the fallback for other OS/arch assets
and the self-update channel. Route these paths (and an optional `get.<domain>`
host) to the `api` service in the ingress.

`/agent/latest/<asset>` is a compatibility route backed by the immutable
versioned release selected by `OPENGENI_AGENT_STABLE_VERSION` (default `0.1.16`).
`OPENGENI_AGENT_RELEASES_BASE_URL` selects the archive origin. Promote or roll
back the stable channel by changing the configured version only after the
corresponding `agent-v<version>` release and its signed assets exist; never move
or delete an agent release tag. A baked asset still takes precedence so a
deployed control-plane image serves its release-coherent binary directly.
Explicit `/agent/v<version>/<asset>` binary and signature requests always use
that immutable archive release; a baked canary cannot override a version pin.
The same deployment serves signed `/agent/stable/manifest.json` and
`manifest.json.minisig` routes so an enrolled agent updates through a control
plane it already trusts instead of depending on public DNS. Beta is independent
and unavailable unless `OPENGENI_AGENT_BETA_VERSION` points at an existing signed
immutable release.

### Enrolling a machine

Enrollment binds a machine to a workspace and requires the enable flag. Two paths
are supported:

- **Device flow**: the agent starts an enrollment
  (`/v1/enrollments/device/start`) and a workspace member holding
  `enrollments:manage` approves it at the consent page
  (`/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/enrollments/device/approve`).
- **Zero-click enroll token**: a workspace member holding `enrollments:manage`
  mints a short-TTL enroll token
  (`/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/enrollments/token`) that the agent redeems
  headlessly (`/v1/enrollments/token/exchange`) with no human approval — suited
  to fleet or headless provisioning.

Client SDKs surface the machine dashboard and enrollment flow through the
`@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and target a session at a specific machine
with `CreateSessionRequest.targetSandboxId` (plus an optional `workingDir`).

## Security Boundary

OpenGeni separates deployment edge access from product access. `OPENGENI_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` is an optional deployment shared-key boundary for smoke tests and simple self-hosting. It is not the tenant model and it does not create users, accounts, workspaces, or billing state. Set `OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY` through a Kubernetes Secret, ExternalSecret, or provider secret manager; ordinary clients send it as `x-opengeni-access-key`. A valid first-party delegated bearer may enter the `/v1` product API without carrying that static key, but the normal access resolver and attempt fences still enforce its exact embedded authority. Deployment-only surfaces continue to require the static key.

Product access is controlled by `OPENGENI_PRODUCT_ACCESS_MODE`:

- `local` bootstraps a local default account/workspace.
- `configured` supports self-hosted embedded deployments with delegated bearer tokens or the deployment shared-key boundary.
- `managed` uses Better Auth for browser human auth, OpenGeni-owned API keys for product/API access, Stripe prepaid credits, usage, limits, and local entitlement mirrors.

Configured deployments using `OPENGENI_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` reuse
`OPENGENI_ACCESS_KEY` to sign internal first-party delegation when
`OPENGENI_DELEGATION_SECRET` is unset. An explicit delegation secret always wins.
`OPENGENI_DEFAULT_FIRST_PARTY_MCP_TOOLS` sets the selection for omitted session
tool policies and `OPENGENI_ALLOWED_FIRST_PARTY_MCP_TOOLS` sets the hard runtime
ceiling; each accepts a JSON array or comma-separated canonical tool names.

Long-lived public deployments should still sit behind a gateway or ingress stack that provides:

- TLS termination with a managed certificate.
- Authentication and authorization for every user-facing route.
- Rate limits and request size limits appropriate for session, file, and SSE traffic.
- Long-lived SSE support with buffering disabled and read/send timeouts of at least `3600` seconds.
- Access logs that include request id, user or tenant id from the gateway, route, status, and duration.
- Explicit deny rules for internal-only surfaces if you expose only the public client API.

When `OPENGENI_AUTH_REQUIRED=true`, `/v1/config/client` remains public but does not expose the access key, `POST /v1/client-errors` remains public so the web app can count failures before sign-in (it accepts only a closed, content-free report from the deployment's own web origins and bounds its own admission; the browser sends it with `credentials: "omit"`, so a host behind edge basic auth must also list `/v1/client-errors` as an `Exact` path on the Helm `publicIngress` to receive it), `POST /v1/analytics-consent` remains public on the same terms so the analytics banner's answer is counted before sign-in (list it as an `Exact` `publicIngress` path too behind edge basic auth), `/healthz` is public by default for Kubernetes probes, and `/metrics` is protected by default unless `OPENGENI_AUTH_ALLOW_METRICS=true` is set for an internal scraper path.

For AKS smoke deployments using `ingress-nginx` behind an Azure LoadBalancer service, configure the ingress controller service health probes explicitly. HTTP/HTTPS probes to `/` can mark ingress-nginx unhealthy when the default backend returns a non-200 response, leaving the public VIP allocated but unrouted. TCP probes are sufficient for the temporary ingress-controller smoke path:

```yaml
controller:
  service:
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-protocol: Tcp
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/port_80_health-probe_protocol: Tcp
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/port_443_health-probe_protocol: Tcp
```

### API request source and auth rate limits

Every API rate limit and abuse quota keys on one request source address:
managed sign-in, sign-up, verification, and password-reset limits (Better
Auth), the address recorded on each auth session, MCP OAuth client
registration, Connected Machine enrollment, invited-user account setup, and
browser login transactions. By default it is the transport peer address
reported by Bun, and caller-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` are
ignored, so a caller cannot choose its own bucket.

Behind a fixed proxy chain, set `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=<count>`
(0-16, default 0). OpenGeni then takes the client address from
`X-Forwarded-For`, walking that many entries from the server side, so values a
caller prepends never replace the address the trusted edge observed. Each
trusted proxy must append the address of the peer that connected to it, or
overwrite the header with the original client address. A missing, short, or
malformed chain falls back to the transport peer. Enable it only when firewall
or network-policy rules prevent direct API access; with `networkPolicy.enabled`
the chart's API NetworkPolicy admits only the ingress controller, web, and
collector pods. `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (comma-separated CIDRs or
addresses, optional, requires a hop count) additionally honors the forwarded
chain only when the transport peer is inside one of those ranges, for example
the node/pod subnet the ingress controller runs in. Boot fails on a malformed
entry. Without an enforcing NetworkPolicy plugin, any in-cluster pod in a
trusted range can still reach the API directly and set the header, so keep
untrusted workloads out of that range.

For `ingress-nginx` on a cloud LoadBalancer, the default
`externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster` source-NATs every request to a node address,
so all users share a handful of rate-limit buckets. Set
`controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local` so the controller sees the
real client, then set `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1`: with its default
`use-forwarded-headers: false`, ingress-nginx overwrites `X-Forwarded-For` with
the address it observed. Add one hop for each further trusted proxy (for
example a CDN) in front of the controller. Leaving it at 0 behind
ingress-nginx keys every client on the controller pod address instead.

Setting the hop count before the traffic policy change is safe, but until
`externalTrafficPolicy: Local` is live every limiter keys on the few node
addresses, so each per-address limit acts as a deployment-wide limit. Email
sign-in and sign-up allow at least Better Auth's previous default (3 per 10 s)
per address for this reason, but OAuth callbacks, email verification, and
password-reset completion are tighter than Better Auth's old defaults. Put the
traffic policy change in place before expecting a burst of real users, such as
a launch.

Managed auth applies per-client-address limits to sign-in, sign-up, social
sign-in and callbacks, verification email, email verification, and password
reset, plus per-email limits (shared by every API replica) on email sign-in,
sign-up, password-reset requests, and verification-email requests. The exact
values live in `apps/api/src/auth/managed-auth-rate-limits.ts`. Each per-email
limit has two fixed windows: a tight one per email and client address, and a
looser one per email that only attempts admitted by the first reach. A single
client address therefore exhausts an email's budget only for itself; locking a
person out of email/password sign-in, sign-up, password reset, or verification
mail needs at least five client addresses inside the window, and social
sign-in is never limited per email. The accepted cost is that a distributed
attacker may still spend the looser budget. IPv6 clients key on their /64 in
every limiter. A refused Better Auth request receives HTTP 429 with an
`X-Retry-After` header; the browser session-set sign-in returns 429
`login_transaction_rate_limited` with `Retry-After` and
`details.retryAfterSeconds`. Per-email counters are stored as keyed digests,
never as email or client addresses.

Upgrading a managed deployment behind a proxy: earlier releases let Better Auth
read a single-value `X-Forwarded-For` by default. It now ignores forwarding
headers unless `OPENGENI_API_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is set, so without it every
user shares the proxy's address and its sign-in and sign-up limits. The
MCP-only `OPENGENI_MCP_OAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is retired; API startup and
runtime-artifact generation fail when it is still set to anything but `0`.

Secret delivery should use one of these patterns:

- Kubernetes Secret created by an external secret operator from Azure Key Vault, Vault, Doppler, 1Password, or an equivalent system.
- Workload identity plus an application-side secret fetcher, once the application layer owns that integration.
- A short-lived manually created Kubernetes Secret only for smoke tests.

Do not put provider credentials, model keys, storage keys, kubeconfigs, TLS private keys, Terraform state, or generated connection strings in committed values files. Sandbox credentials are opt-in through `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_PREPARATION_PROFILES` and `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_ENV_ALLOWLIST`; keep the default `none` profile unless the run truly needs cloud or GitHub credentials inside the sandbox.

### Sandbox rollout configuration authority

Managed staging and production have one authoritative injection path for the
sandbox rollout controls: set `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_OWNERSHIP_ENABLED`,
`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_LAZY_PROVISION`, and
`OPENGENI_RIG_VERIFICATION_LEASE_OWNERSHIP_ENABLED` in the environment consumed
by `bun run deployment:runtime-artifacts`, then publish the generated
`opengeni-runtime` Secret through the deployment's configured secret manager.
The artifact generator preserves explicit `true` and `false`; an unset key is
omitted and retains the config package's safe default of `false`.

API, control-worker, and turn-worker Pods load the chart ConfigMap first and the
runtime Secret second, so the Secret wins any duplicate key. Committed example
values may state explicit local/preview defaults, but they are not production
rollout authority and must not be copied into a managed production overlay.
Remove any direct Pod `env`, shell export, or secondary ConfigMap override for
these three keys before rollout.

Each API and worker `/metrics` endpoint exposes
`opengeni_sandbox_rollout_config{feature,state}` with the bounded features
`ownership`, `lazy_provision`, and `rig_verification_lease_ownership` and the
states `configured` and `effective`. The standard `component` and
`deployment_revision` labels identify the workload revision without tenant,
session, credential, or provider identifiers. Lazy provisioning can be
configured while remaining ineffective until ownership is enabled, which is
reported explicitly.

Roll out ownership first. After every reaper/verifier consumer reports the
compatible revision, enable sandbox environment-verification lease ownership separately as
described in [Sandbox Environment operational rollout](rigs.md#operational-rollout). Enable lazy
provisioning only after the credential/resource eager-path canaries for the
target release are green.

## Advisory work-discovery rollout

Related-work discovery and durable typed work claims use additive rolling
migrations and four independent runtime settings. For a conservative rollout,
deploy the schema/application with all four settings explicitly false, enable
claim mutations first to collect evidence, enable discovery for selected
API/MCP consumers after observing its bounded metrics, and enable human
advisories last. The automatic-nudge setting remains false: no automatic nudge
producer is shipped.

Rollback is forward-only and flag-based. Disable human advisories, then
discovery, then claim mutations as needed. Ordinary session browsing remains
available when discovery is off, existing evidence remains durable, and
lifecycle settlement continues when mutation tools are off. Do not delete claim
rows, reverse the migration ledger, or drop the search indexes as a feature
rollback. The exact flags, benchmark commands, metrics, alert guidance, and
authority boundaries are in
[`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md).

## Observability

OpenGeni emits Prometheus-native metrics. Scrape `/metrics` directly; do not route scraped metrics through OTLP. API and worker processes also emit structured JSON logs and optional OTLP/HTTP JSON traces.

### Out-of-band read-only health audit

Run the frequent deployment audit from an operator host that has read-only
`kubectl` access and can list the Helm release. It does not create Kubernetes
resources, exec into pods, restart workloads, resume sessions, or run synthetic
agent/storage checks. Internal API, worker, and relay endpoints are read through
the Kubernetes Service proxy, so ClusterIP services do not need to be publicly
exposed:

```bash
bun run deployment:health-audit -- \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --release opengeni \
  --expected-revision "$DECLARED_SOURCE_REVISION" \
  --upstream-revision "$OPTIONAL_CURRENT_MAIN"
```

The command always prints one bounded
`opengeni.deployment-health-audit.v1` JSON document and uses stable exit codes:

| Exit | Status        | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| ---: | --- | --- |
|  `0` | `healthy`     | Every requested read-only check passed.                                                                                     |
|  `1` | `degraded`    | The deployment is serving, but recent restarts or warning events need observation.                                          |
|  `2` | `incident`    | A workload, endpoint, Helm release, PVC, or deployment-revision invariant failed.                                           |
|  `3` | `audit_error` | The audit itself could not establish trustworthy evidence, for example because inventory JSON was unavailable or malformed. |

`--upstream-revision` is context only. A coherent, intentionally pinned
deployment behind upstream is healthy. `--expected-revision` is declarative
authority: a mismatch between that value and the API/workers is an incident.
Raw command stderr is never copied into the JSON result.

Use `--verify-observability` only from the exact deployed OpenGeni source tree.
It composes `scripts/verify-observability-stack.ts`, which compares canonical
dashboard bytes and source annotations as well as live Prometheus/Grafana state.

This read-only command is suitable for a frequent systemd timer, CI job, or
external watchdog. Keep `deployment:conformance` on a slower cadence: that
suite intentionally creates and cleans up temporary sessions, scheduled tasks,
and storage objects, so it proves deeper behavior but is not a liveness probe.

Service endpoints:

- API: `GET /healthz` on `OPENGENI_API_PORT` (default `8000`); `GET /traffic-readyz` checks Postgres for traffic routing, while `GET /readyz` reports Postgres, NATS, and Temporal with bounded timeouts. `GET /metrics` is served on `OPENGENI_API_METRICS_PORT` when it is set, and then never on `OPENGENI_API_PORT`, so an ingress that forwards every path to the API cannot publish it. Without it, `/metrics` stays on `OPENGENI_API_PORT` (the local and Docker Compose default). The Helm chart sets it from `api.metricsPort` (default `9464`) behind a separate always-ClusterIP `<release>-api-metrics` Service that the ServiceMonitor, scrape annotations, and bundled collector use; do not route it through an Ingress. The ServiceMonitor relabels those series back to the public API Service's `service`/`job` identity, so alerts keyed on `service="<release>-api"` keep matching; annotation-based scrapers see the new Service name. `api.metricsPort: null` restores the legacy single-port layout.
- Worker: `GET /metrics`, `GET /healthz`, and `GET /readyz` on `OPENGENI_WORKER_HTTP_PORT` (default `8001`); readiness requires lifecycle state `ready` plus healthy Postgres, NATS, and Temporal checks. The standalone worker reserves a one-connection Postgres probe pool so ordinary activity-pool saturation cannot create false readiness failures. A draining worker stays live but becomes unready before polling stops.
- Relay: `GET /healthz` on `OPENGENI_RELAY_BIND` (the wss port, default `8443`) when the relay is enabled. `GET /metrics` is served on `OPENGENI_RELAY_METRICS_BIND` (a `host:port`) when it is set, and then never on the wss port, so an ingress that forwards every path of the relay host cannot publish it. Without it, `/metrics` stays on the wss port (the local development default, where the relay binds loopback). The relay refuses to start when both binds share a port. The Helm chart sets it from `relay.metricsPort` (default `9464`) behind a separate always-ClusterIP `<release>-relay-metrics` Service that the relay ServiceMonitor and scrape annotations use; do not route it through an Ingress. The ServiceMonitor relabels those series back to the public relay Service's `service`/`job` identity; annotation-based scrapers see the new `<release>-relay-metrics` Service name. The default needs a relay image from the same release or later; `relay.metricsPort: null` restores the legacy single-port layout, including for an older pinned relay image.

API and worker health responses include the non-fatal warning
`github_app_bot_identity_unavailable` when that process has partial workspace
GitHub App configuration, cannot derive the App bot identity, and has no
complete `OPENGENI_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`OPENGENI_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` fallback. Compare
the warning across API and worker processes: a difference means attach and turn
startup would declare different stable Git identity environment keys. The
warning never includes provider credentials and does not change liveness.

Useful settings:

- `OPENGENI_OBSERVABILITY_STRUCTURED_LOGS=true` for JSON logs.
- `OPENGENI_OBSERVABILITY_METRICS_ENABLED=true` to expose process and domain metrics.
- `OPENGENI_WORKER_HTTP_PORT=8001` for the worker metrics/health listener.
- `OPENGENI_AUTH_ALLOW_HEALTH=true` allows `/healthz`, `/traffic-readyz`, and `/readyz` through the deployment-key gate.
- `OPENGENI_AUTH_ALLOW_METRICS=true` allows API `/metrics` through the deployment-key gate for an internal scraper path.
- `OPENGENI_API_METRICS_PORT=9464` moves API `/metrics` to a dedicated internal listener. That listener serves nothing else and applies the same deployment-key rules.
- `OPENGENI_RELAY_METRICS_BIND=0.0.0.0:9464` moves relay `/metrics` to a dedicated internal listener that serves nothing else.
- `OPENGENI_DISABLE_OPENAI_TRACING=true` disables OpenAI Agents SDK tracing; tracing also defaults off when no OTLP endpoint is configured.
- `OPENGENI_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4318` to export spans to an OpenTelemetry Collector.
- `OPENGENI_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=key=value,...` for exporter headers; put this in a secret when it contains credentials.

The Helm chart has optional Prometheus Operator wiring, off by default:

```bash
helm upgrade --install opengeni deploy/helm/opengeni \
  --namespace opengeni \
  --set observability.serviceMonitor.enabled=true \
  --set observability.prometheusRule.enabled=true \
  --set secret.existingSecret=opengeni-runtime
```

Upgrade note for clusters that enforce NetworkPolicy: with
`networkPolicy.enabled=true`, the API NetworkPolicy admits only the bundled
collector and `networkPolicy.monitoring` to `api.metricsPort`, never the
`networkPolicy.ingressController` peers. Before the dedicated listener, a
Prometheus outside the release could scrape the API on its public port through
the ingress-controller rule, whose default empty selectors admit every pod. If
such a Prometheus (ServiceMonitor or scrape annotations) scrapes the API, set
`networkPolicy.monitoring` to its namespace and pod selectors before upgrading;
otherwise the API target goes down and the `up == 0` availability alert fires.
The relay follows the same rule: with `relay.metricsPort` set, the relay
NetworkPolicy admits only `networkPolicy.monitoring` to that port, and the wss
port admits only the ingress controller. A Prometheus that reached the relay's
wss port through the ingress-controller rule needs `networkPolicy.monitoring`
too. The default `relay.metricsPort` needs a relay image from the same release
or later: an older relay binary ignores `OPENGENI_RELAY_METRICS_BIND` and keeps
`/metrics` on the wss port, so its scrape target goes down. When you pin an older
relay image, set `relay.metricsPort: null` to keep the legacy layout. The managed
example values files carry a commented `monitoring` block.

`ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` templates render only when `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` CRDs are installed. The canonical rules cover turns without durable progress (`opengeni_turn_oldest_no_progress_age_seconds > 900`), a model-aware automatic context-compaction start that remains durably pending for 15 minutes, traffic-gated sandbox create failure ratio, warming timeouts, orphan sandbox growth, overdue finite-lifetime rotation, checkpoint deletion failures, terminal-owner retained-process backlog, expired drains, stale/absent inventory projections, scraped target availability, release-owned turn-worker restarts and crash loops, durable worker-death recovery and exhausted recovery, turn-worker memory-guard target/drain/failure signals, Google Drive sync failure ratio, reconnect-required events, and explicit Drive sync limit hits, plus node-relative memory/I/O PSI, swap activity, kubelet runtime errors, and NotReady state. Compaction start/completion counters initialize at zero for rate diagnostics; a trigger-maintained exact-attempt pending projection and control-worker freshness gauge preserve alert truth across concurrent activities, terminal skips, and turn-worker restarts without exporting tenant identities. Worker-death recovery outcomes are emitted by the fenced control activity after the durable recovery transaction wins, because the process-local metrics registry of the dead turn worker no longer exists. Drive rules are fenced to the exact namespace, Helm release, configured environment, and `google_drive` provider. Node alerts are joined to `kube_pod_info` so they retain only nodes hosting the current OpenGeni Helm release; deployments without node-exporter or kube-state-metrics produce no false series. `observability.prometheusRule.inventoryFreshnessSeconds` defaults to 300 seconds and must cover at least three configured sandbox-reaper periods; Helm rejects an unsafe pairing. Read-only inventory refresh remains active when sandbox ownership mutation is disabled, so an ownership fence does not silently age every inventory projection out. `observability.prometheusRule.rules` appends environment-specific rules; it never replaces the canonical safety catalog. The chart-managed OpenTelemetry Collector remains optional and is for traces/logs forwarding, not scraped metrics.

Minimum production dashboards should cover:

- API traffic: request rate, error rate, and p50/p95/p99 latency by `route`, `method`, `status`, `variable set`, and `component`. `route` is a bounded template, never a raw path: an explicit established label, or else the registered path template of the Hono handler that answers the request (for example `/v1/organizations/:organizationId/members`). Better Auth endpoints behind the `/v1/auth/*` registration keep a closed set of labels (`/v1/auth/sign-up/email`, `/v1/auth/callback/google`, and so on). `/v1/unknown` and `/unknown` now mean that no registered handler matched, so a sustained rise indicates 404 probing or a client/server route mismatch rather than unlabeled product traffic.
- Sign-up funnel (managed access mode): `opengeni_auth_events_total{event="sign_up"|"email_verified"|"sign_in",method="email"|"google"|"github"|"other"}`, `opengeni_organization_setup_total{outcome="created"|"failed"}` for the self-service post-sign-in organization setup, and `opengeni_signup_acquisition_total{source="producthunt"|"website"|"direct"|"other"}` for new accounts. Every series initializes at zero. `sign_up` counts Better Auth user creation (a duplicate sign-up for an existing address is not counted); `sign_in` counts non-discarded provider sessions, including the first session of a new social account and, in the default `legacy` session-set mode, the session that the first successful email-verification click creates (a reused link creates none). A new email user's first `sign_in` is therefore normally that click, the session they continue into organization setup with, not a later password sign-in; read the funnel as `sign_up` -> `email_verified` -> `sign_in` -> organization setup `created`. `sign_in` is a session count that includes returning sign-ins, not a unique-user count. A mail link scanner that follows the verification link first takes that automatic sign-in, so the person's later password sign-in is a second `sign_in` and `sign_in` can exceed one per new email user. Invited-user account setup is not a sign-up. The acquisition source is normalized server-side from first-touch `utm_*`/`ref` parameters the web app forwards with the sign-up request or OAuth state (including the session-set social start in `dual`/`broker` mode); no per-user acquisition data is stored. The acquisition counter increments when the account is created, before email verification, so it includes accounts that never verify (and bot sign-ups); `email_verified` carries no source label, so compare the two only in aggregate. A Product Hunt listing adds `?ref=producthunt` to its link, and a `producthunt` `ref` wins over any `utm_source`: point the listing at `https://app.opengeni.ai/?mode=signup&ref=producthunt`, or at the marketing site only while it forwards the inbound `ref` onto its app links, otherwise those visitors count as `website`. An idempotent replay of a committed organization setup request counts `created` again. These counters are process-local; aggregate them with `sum` across API replicas and use `increase()` over the reporting window.
- Analytics consent: `opengeni_analytics_consent_total{decision="granted"|"denied"}` counts answers to the web console's optional-analytics banner, and `opengeni_analytics_consent_reports_rejected_total{reason}` counts refused reports; both initialize at zero. Only a changed answer is counted, so it is a count of decisions, not of people. Use the `denied` share to state how much of the consenting audience PostHog cannot see; people who never answer the banner are not counted at all, so also compare PostHog's consented sign-ins with the server `sign_in` counter. See [`application-observability.md`](application-observability.md#analytics-consent).
- Advisory work discovery: request/outcome rate, p50/p95/p99 duration, result count, response bytes, overlap count, stable match-class distribution, and observer errors from the `opengeni_work_discovery_*` family. Keep only its fixed surface/mode/outcome/scope/match labels; never add workspace, session, query, subject, title, goal, claim, version, or provenance labels. See [`work-discovery.md`](work-discovery.md).
- Workspace Insights: `opengeni_workspace_insights_request_duration_seconds{range,provider_filter,model_filter,outcome}` measures the complete route handler, including access resolution, aggregation, contract projection, and response construction. Its exact `le="2"` bucket verifies the default unfiltered weekly view's two-second target. Labels carry only closed range/outcome values and filter-presence flags, never workspace, subject, provider, or model values. If the `usage_bundle` or `model_bundle` phase dominates `opengeni_workspace_insights_phase_duration_seconds`, check the fact authority functions still carry `enable_nestloop=off` (migration 0512): a time window newer than the last `ANALYZE` is estimated at about one row, and a nested-loop plan rescans every workspace session per fact. The route shares one in-flight rollup only between concurrent requests with the same workspace, range, filters, and database RLS actor.
- Worker execution: activity run rate, failure rate, and p50/p95/p99 `runAgentTurn` duration by `activity`, `status`, `variable set`, and `component`.
- Google Drive sync: run outcome and failure ratio, reconnect-required events, p95 terminal activity-batch duration, logical provider requests, physical provider attempts/retries, explicit limit hits, and bounded terminal failure reasons, scoped by namespace, environment, release, and provider where applicable.
- Turn lifecycle: `opengeni_turns_total{outcome}`, `opengeni_turn_duration_seconds`, `opengeni_turns_inflight`, `opengeni_turn_oldest_inflight_age_seconds`, and `opengeni_turn_oldest_no_progress_age_seconds`. In-flight and progress gauges are worker-local and exact-attempt-qualified: recoverable replacement attempts coexist without overwriting one another, and physical activity finalization always removes its own attempt even when durable outcome classification is unavailable.
- Turn startup: the canonical `OpenGeni · Turn Startup` dashboard exposes 7-day and 30-day views of `opengeni_turn_worker_preparation_duration_seconds`, every bounded `opengeni_turn_startup_phase_duration_seconds` phase, and real cumulative `opengeni_turn_startup_milestone_duration_seconds{milestone="queue"|"provider_dispatch"|"first_byte"}` p50/p95/p99. Phase observations can overlap or nest: never sum them as elapsed critical-path time. `runtime_stream_initialization` replaces the misleading phase name `provider_dispatch`; the actual wire-dispatch milestone is unchanged. Nonblocking MCP preparation is recorded separately as `opengeni_tool_background_preparation_duration_seconds`, not as startup, even when it overlaps startup. The production observability example retains 30 days; environment overlays must preserve equivalent local or remote-write retention if they promise the 30-day view.
- Model, MCP, Codex, and sandbox SLIs: `opengeni_model_calls_total{provider,outcome}`, `opengeni_model_call_duration_seconds{provider}`, `opengeni_context_compaction_starts_total{trigger}`, `opengeni_context_compactions_total{trigger}`, `opengeni_context_compaction_pending`, `opengeni_context_compaction_oldest_pending_age_seconds`, `opengeni_context_compaction_monitor_fresh`, `opengeni_mcp_tool_calls_total{outcome}`, `opengeni_mcp_tool_call_duration_seconds{outcome}`, `opengeni_codex_credential_selections_total{strategy,reason}`, `opengeni_codex_credential_failures_total{kind,outcome}`, `opengeni_codex_pool_observations_total{depth}`, `opengeni_codex_pool_low_total{depth}`, `opengeni_sandbox_creates_total{backend,image_source,outcome}`, `opengeni_sandbox_create_duration_seconds{backend,image_source}`, logical `opengeni_sandbox_provisions_total{backend,stage,category,outcome,expected}` plus `opengeni_sandbox_provision_duration_seconds` and `opengeni_sandbox_provision_internal_attempts`, internal `opengeni_sandbox_provision_attempts_total{backend,stage,category,outcome}` plus its duration histogram, `opengeni_sandbox_operations_total{backend,op,outcome}` (`ok`, expected path `not_found`, or actual `failed`), `opengeni_sandbox_operation_duration_seconds{backend,op}`, `opengeni_sandbox_inventory_refresh_timestamp_seconds{domain}`, the chart's freshness-filtered `opengeni:*:fresh_max` inventory recording rules, `opengeni_sandbox_warming_timeouts_total{backend,stage}`, and `opengeni_sandbox_orphans_terminated_total`. Logical provision metrics deliberately classify expected lifecycle transitions separately from actual failures; correlation/provider/session identities and error text are not labels.
- Queue, admission, and billing: `opengeni_turns_queued`, `opengeni_turn_eligible_backlog`, `opengeni_turn_eligible_backlog_oldest_age_seconds`, `opengeni_turn_slot_saturation_ratio`, `opengeni_credit_balance_micros{account_id}`, `opengeni_credit_micros_total{kind}`, `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_runtime_enabled`, `opengeni_verified_signup_trial_credits_deployment_enabled`, and `opengeni_build_info{version,revision}`.
- Sandbox rollout state: `opengeni_sandbox_rollout_config{feature,state}` across API, control-worker, and turn-worker revisions; alert on disagreement before advancing a staged rollout.
- Dependency health: Postgres connection health, Temporal worker poll health, NATS connectivity, object-storage write/read conformance, and sandbox backend readiness.
- Runtime health: API/worker restarts, continuous turn-worker host/cgroup utilization and RSS reserve consumption, node memory/I/O PSI, swap-out activity, kubelet runtime errors, node readiness, pod pending time, collector scrape/export errors, and OTLP export failures.

Minimum production alerts:

- API/worker availability: `/healthz` or `/readyz` is unavailable from probes for more than 2 minutes.
- API errors: 5xx ratio is above 2% for 10 minutes, or any critical route stays above 5% for 5 minutes.
- API latency: p95 latency is above the product SLO for 10 minutes, tracked separately for `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions`, event replay, SSE, scheduled-task trigger, and file routes.
- Turn stuck: a physical worker attempt has made no durable progress for more than 15 minutes for 5 minutes. Overlapping recovery attempts are counted and aged independently.
- Turn admission: Temporal's oldest eligible `runAgentTurn` backlog is above 30 seconds for 5 minutes, or a pod remains above 90% of memory-safe slots while eligible work waits. Durable prompts behind a pause do not count.
- Turn startup SLOs: cumulative queue p95 above 5 seconds, queue-to-provider-dispatch p95 above 60 seconds, or queue-to-first-byte p95 above 120 seconds for 15 minutes with at least five samples. The Helm values are configurable; use the phase dashboard before assigning the delay to the sandbox or provider.
- Context compaction: an exact active attempt's latest automatic compaction landmark remains durably `started` for 15 minutes. Terminal skips settle normally, and the control-worker projection survives turn-worker replacement while following each resolved model's actual threshold.
- Sandbox create failures: sandbox create failure ratio is above 20% for 10 minutes.
- Sandbox orphan growth: `increase(opengeni_sandbox_orphans_terminated_total[30m]) > 0`.
- Codex credential pool: any zero-eligible observation is critical; repeated one-eligible observations are warning-level reduced redundancy. The default PrometheusRule uses `opengeni_codex_pool_low_total{depth="zero"|"one"}`. The matching "Codex eligible credential pool is low" log line is throttled to the first observation per workspace pool depth and then one line per 10 minutes carrying `suppressedCount` and `reason` (`eligible_pool_zero` or `eligible_pool_one`); alert on the counter, not the log. Connected Machine auth-callout denial warnings use the same per-source throttle (one line per minute per rejected bearer or enrollment, with `reason` `invalid_bearer`, `inactive_enrollment`, or `duplicate_runner`); the denial itself is never throttled.
- Worker failures: `runAgentTurn` failure ratio is above 5% for 10 minutes.
- Worker duration: p95 `runAgentTurn` duration is above the expected model/tool budget for 15 minutes.
- Scheduler health: manual scheduled-task conformance does not dispatch a session through Temporal within the configured timeout.
- Storage health: object-storage conformance cannot create, complete, presign, and read a file.
- Streaming health: SSE replay conformance does not return persisted events after reconnect.
- Collector health: collector pod is not ready or its configured OTLP exporter reports failures.
- Secret/sandbox hygiene: conformance detects unintended sandbox variable-set variables or sandbox backend startup failures.

## Azure Reference

The Azure Terraform root lives at `deploy/terraform/azure`.

It supports:

- AKS for OpenGeni workloads.
- ACR for images.
- Key Vault for runtime secret storage.
- Managed Azure PostgreSQL when `postgres.mode = "managed"`, with optional
  non-secret policies for capacity and `max_connections`
  (`managed_postgres_capacity`), a high-availability standby, custom
  maintenance window, and server update timeout for standby seeding
  (`managed_postgres_availability`), and CPU/connection
  saturation alerts on the observability action group
  (`managed_postgres_alerts`). See `deploy/terraform/azure/README.md`.
- Existing customer Postgres when `postgres.mode = "external"`.
- Existing Temporal endpoint when `temporal.mode = "external"`.
- Managed Azure Blob storage when `object_storage.mode = "managed"` and `object_storage.api = "azure-blob"`.
- Existing Azure Blob or S3-compatible object storage through runtime secrets.

Set `object_storage.cors_allowed_origins` to `["*"]` so browser SDK hosts can
upload files to signed Blob URLs without per-application registration.

Pod stdout/stderr lives only as long as each pod. To retain it, enable the
optional `aks_container_insights` object together with `observability.enabled`.
It installs the AKS monitoring addon with managed-identity ingestion, one data
collection rule scoped to the listed namespaces (`ContainerLogV2`, Kubernetes
events, and pod inventory by default), and a mandatory daily ingestion cap on
the observability Log Analytics workspace, whose retention stays 30 days.
The cap is shared with Application Insights data in that workspace, so size it
well above normal ingestion; reaching it pauses ingestion until the daily reset.
Two log search alerts notify the observability action group when the cap is
reached or when collection stops. An optional `container_log_transform_kql`
redacts container log content, such as ingress query strings, before it is
retained.
The addon adds a DaemonSet with CPU and memory requests on every node, so check
node headroom first. See `deploy/terraform/azure/README.md`.

Before applying anything in Azure:

1. Keep provider resource names and cleanup notes in private operator-controlled storage outside the repository.
2. Keep secrets in local env files, Key Vault, or Terraform variables that are not committed.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure init
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure validate
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure plan
```

After apply, save exact resource names and cleanup commands outside the repository.

## AWS Reference

The AWS Terraform root lives at `deploy/terraform/aws`.

It supports EKS, ECR, S3, AWS Secrets Manager, optional RDS PostgreSQL, and existing Postgres/Temporal endpoints. Use `deploy/helm/opengeni/values.aws-managed.example.yaml` as the non-secret Helm values shape.

Set `object_storage.cors_allowed_origins` to `["*"]` so browser SDK hosts can
upload files to signed S3 URLs without per-application registration.

Before applying anything in AWS:

1. Keep provider resource names and cleanup notes in private operator-controlled storage outside the repository.
2. Keep secrets in local env files, AWS Secrets Manager, or uncommitted Terraform variables.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws validate
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/aws plan
```

After apply, save exact resource names and cleanup commands outside the repository.

## GCP Reference

The GCP Terraform root lives at `deploy/terraform/gcp`.

It supports GKE, Artifact Registry, GCS, Secret Manager, workload identity, optional Cloud SQL PostgreSQL, and existing Postgres/Temporal endpoints. Use `deploy/helm/opengeni/values.gcp-managed.example.yaml` as the non-secret Helm values shape.

Set `object_storage.cors_allowed_origins` to `["*"]` so browser SDK hosts can
upload files to signed GCS URLs without per-application registration.

Before applying anything in GCP:

1. Keep provider resource names and cleanup notes in private operator-controlled storage outside the repository.
2. Keep secrets in local env files, Secret Manager, or uncommitted Terraform variables.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp validate
terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/gcp plan
```

After apply, save exact resource names and cleanup commands outside the repository.

## Previews

The public repository does not include a pull-request workflow that deploys to
maintainer-owned infrastructure. The `preview-pr` and `preview-branch` profiles
are reusable stack-contract shapes for operator-owned automation. If an operator
wants preview deployments, they should run `bun run deployment:stack` in their
own CI/CD variable set with their own cluster, registry, secrets, and teardown
policy.

Preview profiles are managed-product previews, not fake demos. They use
disposable in-cluster Postgres, Temporal, NATS, and MinIO fixtures so state can
be torn down safely, but they still run the real API, web app, worker, model
provider, and configured sandbox backend. The checked-in
`values.preview-managed.example.yaml` file keeps replicas small and enables the
fixture data plane; generated private runtime artifacts must still provide
managed auth, Resend, Stripe test mode, GitHub App, model-provider, Modal, and
image digest values. Do not use `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=none` for previews
that are meant to validate product behavior.

Preview deployments should be private or maintainer-gated even when signup is
enabled. The source repo may contain the contract, Helm values shape, and
conformance scripts, but not provider secrets, kubeconfigs, Terraform state,
preview tenant data, or unsanitized evidence.

## Cold lost-provider blocker reconciliation

`scripts/operator/reconcile-cold-lost-sandbox-blockers.ts` is the only
supported exceptional repair for blocker rows left by an older provider-loss
transition after the exact lease is already cold. It is not a provider repair,
archive restore, workspace writer, or general-purpose lease editor. Normal
provider-loss handling remains the automatic path described in
[`run-lifecycle.md`](run-lifecycle.md).

Always run the helper from the exact source deployed to the affected control
plane. Its database connection must be the restricted `opengeni_app` role with
row security enabled; preview additionally opens one `REPEATABLE READ, READ
ONLY` transaction and verifies `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on every table it
reads. Preview has no provider dependency and makes no provider or apply call.
The operator must obtain the provider observation separately and supply it as
input. An observation is accepted only when its backend/object identity matches
the selected archive reference, its timestamp is canonical UTC, and it is no
more than five minutes old or 60 seconds ahead of the database snapshot.
Missing, `unknown`, stale, future, malformed, or mismatched observations block.

Build one private reviewed input packet containing every variable below. Use
the exact literal `null` for supplied nullable values; omission means “not
supplied” and blocks. Hashes are 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters and times
are canonical ISO-8601 UTC strings.

The descriptor's `archiveBytes`/`archiveSha256` describe the opaque provider
reference payload. Preview independently decodes `workspaceArchive` and
recomputes that payload's bytes/SHA. `workspace.totalFileBytes` is the sum of
file contents, while `workspace.sha256` is the deterministic GNU-tar full-tree
fingerprint covering names, kinds, modes, symlink targets, and file bytes. They
are distinct facts. `capturedAt` is never used as verification time;
`verifiedAt` is authoritative only when workspace status is `ready`, the
verified revision matches the selected descriptor, and the timestamp is valid.

Run preview:

```bash
OPENGENI_COLD_LOST_LEASE_RECONCILE=preview \
  bun scripts/operator/reconcile-cold-lost-sandbox-blockers.ts
```

The command emits one
`OPENGENI_COLD_LOST_LEASE_RECONCILE_PREVIEW=<json>` receipt. Exit `0` means
`eligible`; exit `2` means blocked. Keep the receipt as private operator
evidence. It binds the complete expected and observed tuple, provider
observation, and every process/admission/PTY/holder/interruption identity and
linkage in a deterministic `clrp1:<sha256>` ID. A missing lease explicitly sets
`inventoryComplete:false` and blocks rather than reporting an authoritative
empty inventory.

Only after independent review of that exact eligible receipt may an authorized
operator rerun the **same input packet** with its preview ID:

```bash
OPENGENI_COLD_LOST_LEASE_RECONCILE=apply \
OPENGENI_RECOVERY_PREVIEW_ID='clrp1:<reviewed-sha256>' \
  bun scripts/operator/reconcile-cold-lost-sandbox-blockers.ts
```

Apply re-previews before locking, locks the exact blocker rows and lease,
re-reads the complete receipt under those locks, and returns `stale` or
`blocked` on any drift. A successful apply only marks exact active retained
processes lost, rejects their exact unsettled admissions, closes exact open
PTYs, deletes the matching process holders, and recomputes lease counters. It
does not advance the epoch, modify archive/workspace generations or recovery
truth, invoke a provider, terminate/create a sandbox, restore an archive, write
the workspace, alter session control/queue/goal state, or replay an operation.

## Conformance

A deployment is not acceptable until it proves:

- API health works.
- Migrations run safely.
- Postgres and pgvector are available.
- Temporal is reachable and workers can poll the task queue.
- NATS pub/sub works.
- SSE reconnect replays from Postgres.
- Object storage can write/read.
- Sandbox backend can start and does not receive unintended credentials.
- A scripted session can create, stream, replay, run, and complete.
- A scheduled task can be created, manually triggered through Temporal, dispatch a session, and be cleaned up.
- Logs, metrics, and traces carry enough correlation data for production debugging.

Use `bun run deployment:stack`, `bun run deployment:preflight`, provider
Terraform validation, Helm rendering, and this conformance suite as the merge
and release gate for deployment changes.


### Background-command launch authority (0419)

Migration `0419_background_command_launch_authority.sql` is rolling: nullable
launch turn/attempt/generation columns and an immutable identity fence let older
adoption writers remain compatible. New writers stamp the existing accepted
attempt; terminal commands use that receipt without creating a personal grant.
Historical managed rows may derive it from their exact retained process, while
unattributed Connected Machine rows remain service-owned. Deploy the new API and
worker together to enable command and wait-timeout causal admission; this source
change does not itself deploy or authorize pre-claim recovery.

### Connection access policies (migration 0424)

Drain every API, control worker, and turn worker before applying
`0424_model_connection_access.sql`. Restart only the policy-aware binary; older
workers do not enforce per-connection model restrictions and must not be used as
rollback images once restrictions are configured. Existing connections retain
unrestricted models and their prior workspace reach. See
[model connection access](model-connection-access.md).

## Feedback storage activation

Migration `0425_feedback_submissions.sql` extends the exact runtime table/privilege
contract. Stop old API and both worker types, migrate, run `db:provision-roles`,
and start the feedback-aware binary. Do not restart an older binary afterward.
See [Feedback](feedback.md) for API, privacy, and retention behavior.

## Message-point fork activation

Migration `0429_message_boundary_session_forks.sql` adds the exact runtime
routine for message-boundary forks. Stop API, control-worker, and turn-worker
processes before migrating, run `db:provision-roles`, and start only the new
binary afterward. Do not use an older binary as the rollback image after this
routine contract changes. Whole-session forks retain their existing signature.
See [Forking at a message](organization-tenancy.md#forking-at-a-message) for
boundary validation and compacted-history limitations.

### Restricting native human accounts

Set `OPENGENI_ALLOWED_USER_EMAILS` to a comma-separated list of exact email
addresses to restrict native human signup, sign-in and existing browser sessions.
Addresses are case-insensitive; email verification remains required. Unset keeps
open registration; an explicitly empty or invalid list fails startup. Apply the
same value to all API replicas and restart them when changing the list.

This is deployment admission, not an organization membership grant. It does not
change organization API keys, external-user authentication, sandbox credentials,
webhook signatures or signed storage URLs. Review existing issued credentials
separately when restricting an already-running deployment: removing an email does
not revoke its previously issued API keys or cancel already accepted work.
