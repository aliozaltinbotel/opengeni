# Connected Machines (bring-your-own-compute)

A **Connected Machine** is one of a session's compute targets — your own
computer (a laptop, a workstation, a CI box, even a macOS machine) connected to
an organization, workspace, or organization user and driven by the agent directly. It is a **first-class, co-equal
primary compute target**, not a backend variant layered on top of a managed
box.

Human device-flow approval defaults to user ownership. A user-owned machine follows
its owner across same-organization workspaces they can currently access; workspace
ownership limits it to the approving workspace, and organization ownership requires
account-admin approval. Only the owner may attach a user machine. Using it from an
exact agent attempt additionally requires an explicit `connected_machine.use` grant
for that session visibility/context. Once/session/always grants use the common
personal-resource lifecycle; every operation revalidates the exact attempt, owner
membership revision, target-workspace access, authority epoch, resource/grant
generation, interruption state, and current machine selection immediately before
the machine transport is used. Revocation advances the machine and common authority
generation and invalidates existing grants.

### Enrollment maintenance boundary

Migration `0498_enrollment_membership_fence.sql` repairs user-owned device approval
under a non-superuser, non-bypass migration owner. Stop every old API/control/turn
worker and supply the exact application-role list before applying it; the migration
refuses live listed connections. Start only the matching binaries afterward—do not
restart pre-0498 approval writers. This is not a rolling or application-rollback-safe
cutover, and preparing the migration does not authorize deployment.

User approval takes the organization membership fence before RLS workspace-tenancy
entry, pending-request locks, and enrollment writes. Both the public wrapper and
SQL finalizer fail closed with `55P03` on fence contention rather than waiting while
an unknown caller may hold a reverse-order lock. Retry the complete transaction
after the membership change settles; no failed approval is automatically replayed.
The finalizer rereads exact active organization membership under that fence and
retains workspace membership `FOR KEY SHARE` to exclude direct runtime DELETEs.
Direct workspace-removal preparation takes the same early nonblocking fence before
downstream rows; its command keeps the existing organization/tenancy prefix.
Legacy token enrollment retains its existing workspace-owned authority contract.

Known separate boundary: `scoped_compute_actor_membership` still uses an
organization-membership `FOR SHARE` that can be blinded by FORCE-RLS under this
owner posture. Its list/rig/attach consumers—including `list_scoped_enrollments`,
`get_scoped_sandbox`, and `authorize_scoped_sandbox_attach`—are not repaired here.
Successful enrollment does not establish a complete Connected Machine availability
fix or prove that those downstream paths work.

Device-code lookup is another unresolved boundary: the migration-0025
`opengeni_private.resolve_device_enrollment_request` SECURITY DEFINER resolver can
return no row under the tested non-bypass owner/FORCE-RLS posture because it lacks
the required context. Independent tests reproduced the same three
`getDeviceEnrollmentRequestByDeviceCode` failures before and after 0498. The legacy
suite's historical 0025 replay recreates this resolver through a superuser, so a
pass after that replay does not validate non-bypass device-code lookup. The 0498
approval/finalization tests do not certify end-to-end device-flow availability;
this migration does not repair the resolver.

This guide is embedder-facing: it shows how to create a session on a machine,
discover the enrolled machines and their metrics, swap a session's active
sandbox, connect a machine (zero-click token or the interactive device flow), and
revoke/detach — all through the typed [`@opengeni/sdk`](../packages/sdk/README.md)
client. The matching UI ships in
[`@opengeni/react/machines`](../packages/react/README.md).

## The two compute targets

|              | Managed Sandbox                  | Connected Machine                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Ownership    | platform-owned, ephemeral        | user-owned, persistent                             |
| Provisioning | platform provisions + tears down | platform **attaches** to what's already there      |
| Repos        | cloned into `/workspace`         | **not cloned** — the machine uses its own git auth |
| Working dir  | `/workspace`                    | the agent-reported absolute host root, optionally narrowed per session |
| Backend enum | `docker`/`modal`/`local`/…       | `selfhosted`                                       |

The model that follows from this: a machine-bound session has **no phantom Modal
"home box"**, **no OpenGeni Git token is distributed to the machine** (it uses
its own SSH / `gh` / credential helper), repos are **not cloned onto it**, and
the agent runs under a **per-session working directory** (making its own
worktrees under that path as it needs them). The authoritative runner Hello
already reports its absolute launch root; OpenGeni persists it and resolves an
optional relative session folder once against that root. The SDK manifest,
exec cwd, filesystem calls, editor, and PTY all use that same host-native path.
Relative operation paths resolve from it and absolute paths stay literal, so
`/workspace` has no special meaning on a machine.

The Files surface advertises that effective path as `FileSystem.root`, including
Windows drive and UNC roots. A canonical absolute `sandbox:` link opens the tree
in the same namespace and sends the negotiated `{ epoch, root }` identity with
each list, read, or mutation. The API validates that the path remains beneath
the advertised root, pins the request to the first resolved active route, and
uses a contained workspace-relative path for machine execution. Responses keep
the canonical host-native spelling; a route or root change returns a retryable
conflict instead of a misleading outside-workspace validation error or a read
from a different target. Provider-independent artifact receipts may still use
their own portable identity where that receipt contract requires it.

The exact model-visible tool catalog remains available through Codemode without
installing a machine credential. OpenGeni sends no Codemode manifest pointer or
token file. Instead, the worker snapshots a renewable exact-attempt URL/bearer
only into each new child exec. It is never written to disk or stable machine
state. The installed binary exposes its absolute path to that authorized child,
so `"$OPENGENI_CODEMODE_NATIVE_CLIENT" codemode list|show|call` works even without
Bun/Node/`ogtool`. Default text and `list --json` return all authorized tools with
short summaries, without an aggregate stdout cap or default pagination;
use `list --query <substring>` to filter, or explicitly opt into a slice with
`--limit <1..100> --offset <integer>`,
`list --json` for digest/count/continuation metadata, or `list --full` for the legacy
complete catalog. `show <path>` returns the complete details/schema for one tool;
redirect large output to a file and read only needed ranges.
It reaches the same journal/executor as model MCP; the machine
still owns every ordinary credential and ambient environment.

This authority follows the session's **active** execution path. The fleet
`run_on` tool is a separate API-side, one-off route to a non-active machine. An
agent call still authorizes and snapshots the frozen initiating human's exact
accepted attempt and revalidates its visibility-keyed grant immediately before
dispatch; it does not change the active pointer or inject Codemode credentials.
Swap the session to that machine, or create the session there, before running
Codemode on it.

For source development, build or run the complete host-native runtime with:

```sh
bun run agent:local-runtime
bun run agent:local-runtime:run
```

The command builds browserd, the pinned agent-browser driver, and
computer-native first, hashes them into one development generation, then embeds
that exact closure in the Rust agent. On macOS it also enables the same real
ScreenCaptureKit/CGEvent desktop feature as the release build. This is the supported local path: copying
an agent binary next to arbitrary helpers can create a protocol-skewed runtime
that production installation and managed updates deliberately forbid.

The macOS native bridge drains Cocoa autorelease pools around synchronous calls
and each Accessibility worker iteration. Stream ownership includes stopping a
requested capture even when startup times out; dropping a timed-out request does
not cancel the OS operation. The desktop viewer publishes discovered targets
before awaiting semantic observation so a stalled app cannot prevent switching
to another window or screen. `macos_autorelease` exercises the actual helper with
Objective-C missing-pool diagnostics enabled; run this ignored test explicitly
in an unlocked local GUI session.

Accessibility notifications invalidate the snapshots that registered the changed
element, so one observed window's value changes do not discard an unrelated
window's observation. Application-wide focus/layout events, unrecognized event
sources, and overflow of the bounded 64-notification queue still invalidate all
snapshots for that process. Every semantic action continues to verify the target,
element identity and observed state immediately before dispatch.

Native window and screen pointer input uses the exact painted frame's encoded
dimensions. Continuous capture retains superseded frame metadata for at most
two seconds, bounded to 32 frames per target and 512 per adapter, so a newer
capture does not reject a pending viewer click. A latest still screenshot keeps
its existing authority during agent planning. Input clears retained frames;
target generation, native identity and current placement checks remain enforced.

On macOS, runner restart waits for the previous launchd label to disappear before
accepting a replacement. A matching program path on a retiring job is not proof
that the replacement started.

If a desktop producer ends after delivering frames, the viewer exposes its
connection error and Reconnect action instead of leaving the last image over
them. Exhausted socket retries become an explicit connection error. Refresh
desktops also retries a failed stream; terminal placement changes still require
the existing replacement-session recovery path.

The Chrome Native Messaging bridge accepts two exact extension origins: the
development manifest key (`imdmcebcclhibdfolbokjbiibpcnpbel`) and the Chrome Web
Store item (`phpmmcbeelfkcinjfbbggegjdcdmnnch`). Both the installed native-host
manifest and the agent's native-host invocation check must include the store
origin. Older agent releases that only accept the development origin cannot
connect the store-installed extension; updating the extension alone cannot fix
that host-side restriction. Store uploads omit the development-only manifest
`key` field.

The bridge generation is an opaque unpadded-base64url token: leading `-` and
`_` are valid and retained verbatim in inventory and discovery. Rejecting either
prefix strands a healthy bridge until its next generation. Rolling migration
`0525_attached_browser_opaque_generations.sql` aligns the database bridge-generation
check with this contract; API validation alone does not restore discovery.
Extension handshake
timeouts and rejected readiness fences clear the exact failed port and reconnect
with bounded backoff; late events from that port cannot invalidate a successor.

Attached Chrome profiles are a separate physical placement. Inventory reports a
`connectionGeneration` that becomes the BrowserSession/ComputerSession
`placementInstanceId`. When that generation changes, OpenGeni marks the exact
device's still-live sessions `lost` with `controller_transition_expired` and
never rebinds the old controller token. In-flight `/end` (`ending`) is left
to finish physical teardown instead of being rewritten to `lost`. Heartbeats
must prove the live generation before they pulse. `/end` still talks to the
live agent with that original fence so the Mac helper can `stopCapture` and
exit; otherwise ScreenCaptureKit leaves `replayd` and multiple
`opengeni-computer-native` processes running. A new shared-seat
ComputerSession displaces the previous helper. Open a replacement through
**Browser → New browser → Connected Chrome**; generic New desktop does not
infer the Chrome device.

Machine availability is also not a turn-admission dependency. A text-only turn
can start while the selected machine is offline. If the model invokes a machine
operation, the typed offline/timeout result returns to the model in-band so it
can explain the outage, choose another available tool or compute target, or help
recover the machine. The transport failure must not replace the agent loop.

## Create a session on a machine

`createSession` grows two fields for a Connected-Machine target:

- **`targetSandboxId`** (uuid) — the enrolled machine to run the session on (a
  `MachineView.sandboxId` from `listMachines`). It **seeds the active-sandbox
  pointer at creation**, so the very first turn lands on that machine.
- **`workingDir`** (host path) — the directory the agent runs the session under
  (its cwd base for exec, terminal, and the file dock). It may be absolute or
  relative to the persisted Hello root. Tilde is rejected because the control
  plane does not know an authenticated service-user home directory.

```ts
import { OpenGeniClient } from "@opengeni/sdk";

const client = new OpenGeniClient({ baseUrl, apiKey });

// Pick a machine from the workspace fleet…
const { machines } = await client.listMachines(workspaceId);
const box = machines.find(
  (m) => m.kind === "selfhosted" && m.state === "online",
);

// …and run the session on it.
const session = await client.createSession(workspaceId, {
  initialMessage: "Run the test suite and fix what's red",
  targetSandboxId: box!.sandboxId, // seeds the active-sandbox pointer at create
  workingDir: "/home/me/projects/app", // the agent's cwd on the machine
});
```

That API-key example applies to workspace- or organization-scoped machines. A
user-scoped machine must be selected by its owning managed human. The managed
web console discovers the machine's personal authority and includes an atomic
`personalResourceAttachment` in the create command after the owner chooses
`once`, `session`, or `always` and acknowledges workspace-shared output. The
server derives the selected enrollment from the locked session, issues
`connected_machine.use` in the same accepted-turn transaction, and preserves a
`once` decision across recovery of that logical turn. Callers never nominate a
machine authority or issue a standalone grant before creating the session.

Rules to keep in mind:

- **`workingDir` requires `targetSandboxId`.** Sending `workingDir` alone (with
  no machine target) is a **422** — a bare working directory has no machine to
  resolve it against.
- Omit `workingDir` and the session runs under the machine's persisted
  **workspace root** (the agent's launch dir).
- New attaches store and return the resolved absolute `workingDir`. Legacy rows
  may remain null/relative until they are reattached; establishment resolves
  them against the current persisted Hello root.
- **Repos are not cloned** onto a machine target. `resources` you attach are
  available for context, but the platform never `git clone`s onto the user's
  real filesystem — the machine uses its own git auth.
- `sandboxBackend` selects the backend for a **managed** sandbox; for a machine
  target the backend is the machine itself, so leave it off and point at the
  machine with `targetSandboxId`.
- When the deployment default itself is `selfhosted`, the web composer starts on
  Connected Machine and selects the first online machine. It does not offer a
  fictional managed default, and submission stays blocked until a machine is
  available. The API also rejects a targetless selfhosted create before writing
  a session.
- **A child spawn with `targetSandboxId` / `machineTarget` is an own-box
  machine-primary home**, even when the parent is `backend: none`. Omitted
  `sandbox` still shares the creator's box only when no machine is named.
  Explicit `sandbox: "shared"` or `{ groupId }` plus a machine target is a
  **422**.
- When a child omits both `sandbox` and `machineTarget`, sharing a parent that is
  currently routed to a Connected Machine automatically copies that exact
  machine and working directory to the child before its first turn. A
  `backend:none` parent remains a backend-none shared home; its valid attached
  machine is an independent active route and is inherited without relabeling the
  child. The model does not choose the machine again. A selfhosted-only create
  with neither an inherited nor explicit machine is rejected before an unusable
  session starts.

The model-facing first-party `session_create` tool makes the dependency
structural: it accepts an optional `machineTarget` object containing required
`targetSandboxId` plus optional `workingDir`, then maps that object to the stable
flat REST/SDK fields above. Consequently the model cannot generate a standalone
`workingDir`. This is a model-contract hardening only; existing REST/SDK callers
continue to use the flat fields.

For the web new-session composer, the actor-private backend draft remembers
only successful creates: the last project, that project's last managed or
machine target, and the last working directory for every project+machine pair.
Switching projects or machines restores the matching nested choice. Absolute
host paths remain tied to the exact machine id and are never reused on another
machine.

Scheduled agent tasks use the same explicit targeting rule. A generated-session
schedule persists a `machineTarget` containing the exact `targetSandboxId` and
optional `workingDir`; the worker proves that machine is still available and
seeds the generated session's active pointer before its first turn. A deployment
whose default backend is `selfhosted` rejects a generated-session schedule that
does not select a machine instead of creating a session that cannot execute.
Manual runs also preflight current liveness and the reported workspace root
before consuming run capacity. After that preflight, session creation rechecks
durable target authority and commits the active pointer in the same transaction
as the new session row. If the target is invalid, removed, revoked, or otherwise
no longer attachable, the create fails without leaving a queued session shell.

Unattended schedules currently accept workspace- and organization-scoped
machines only. User-scoped machines require an owning human's explicit personal
resource attachment, which a future scheduled-execution authority flow must
freeze durably before those machines can be offered safely.

## Discover machines + metrics

`listMachines` returns the workspace fleet plus the active-sandbox pointer. Pass
`sessionId` for an in-session view, which also folds in that session's synthetic
home group box when one exists and the session's active-sandbox pointer. A
`backend:none` session has no synthetic home, but its owned Connected Machines
remain visible and attachable.

List `state` is the durable heartbeat cursor (`lastSeenAt`, `wentOfflineAt`),
not a live ControlRpc ping. A fresh heartbeat is online; a clean goodbye or a
stale/missing heartbeat is offline. The list therefore does not emit
`reconnecting` (that blip needs a missed live probe). Attach, capability
negotiation, and fleet tools still ping when they need to know whether a
responder is answering now.

Runners also sample desktop availability off the control loop and include the
latest completed sample in heartbeats. Display sleep/wake, Mac lock/unlock, and
Screen Recording permission changes refresh the desktop state without restarting
the runner or changing its connection generation. A blocked snapshot disables
desktop access and supplies the reason; it never grants screen-control consent.
Older runners omit this optional field and retain their connect-time Hello state.
An unchanged snapshot does not rewrite capabilities or release/update metadata.

```ts
const res = await client.listMachines(workspaceId, { sessionId });
// res.activeSandboxId — the session's currently-active sandbox (null ⇒ the
//                       home box is active, or none is attached for backend:none)
// res.activeEpoch     — monotonic fence for the pointer (see "swap" below)
// res.machines        — MachineView[]
```

Each `MachineView` carries the fields a dashboard needs:

```ts
type MachineView = {
  sandboxId: string; // the id you pass as targetSandboxId / swap target
  enrollmentId: string | null; // the enrollment id for metrics + revoke
  name: string;
  kind: "modal" | "selfhosted";
  state:
    // derived liveness + consent/display/enrollment state
    | "online"
    | "reconnecting"
    | "offline"
    | "consent_required"
    | "display_unavailable"
    | "enrolling";
  active: boolean; // is this the session's active sandbox?
  isSessionGroup: boolean; // the synthetic Modal group box (not a real machine)
  os: string;
  arch: string;
  hasDisplay: boolean;
  allowScreenControl: boolean;
  sharedSessionCount: number; // live sessions sharing this whole-machine lease
  lastSeenAt: string | null;
  metrics: MetricSample | null; // latest point-in-time sample
};
```

For a time series (the dashboard's charts), read the downsampled (~1/min)
per-machine history over a window. Samples are oldest-first (left-to-right):

```ts
const samples = await client.machineMetricsSeries(workspaceId, enrollmentId, {
  window: "1h", // "15m" | "1h" (default) | "6h" | "24h"
});
// MetricSample: cpuPct, load1/5/15, memUsedBytes/memTotalBytes,
//   diskUsedBytes/diskTotalBytes, gpuUtilPct|null, gpuMemBytes|null,
//   runQueue, sampledAt (ISO-8601). GPU fields are null when no GPU is present.
```

## Control liveness and backpressure

`ERROR_CODE_DRAINING` is a pre-execution admission refusal, not proof that a
machine is at capacity. Runtime errors preserve its typed cause: `agent_update`
means a verified self-update is draining accepted work; `queue_breaker` and
`wait_breaker` identify abnormal admission backlogs. Missing or unrecognized
detail remains an unspecified admission refusal. The same distinction survives
retry exhaustion and structured tool-error rendering. A self-update on a busy host now ends with retryable `update_busy_work` (or
`update_busy_uploads`) and immediately reopens admission. It does not wait for
long-lived servers, cancel accepted work, or restart the host. Request an update
again at a safe idle point. Older runners can remain draining indefinitely;
inspect their accepted operations and coordinate a safe stop/restart with their
owners instead of killing useful work or increasing concurrency limits.

Machine liveness is independent of accepted host operations. The supervisor
answers `ping` and publishes heartbeats outside command execution. Production
admission has no ordinary fixed concurrency or queue-wait limit: its only
circuit breakers are derived from host file-descriptor and process headroom and
sit above normal workloads (including 100 concurrent command requests). Linux
puts the supervisor and each operation in separate cgroup-v2 memory-accounting
leaves for lifecycle ownership and systemd-oomd selection. Startup enables only
the memory controller: CPU stays ambient until an explicit quota needs it, while
I/O and PID controllers remain untouched. The generated unit also sets
`DelegateSubgroup=supervisor`, so systemd starts every supervisor generation in
that stable leaf and can restart it after the empty service root has delegated
controllers to operation siblings. Startup verifies this topology and reports the
exact delegated controller subset it could use. A custom or older unit without
the supervisor subgroup degrades explicitly to ambient unrestricted execution,
preserving crash restart; configured operation policy fails closed on that incapable
runner. The supervisor stamps its leaf with systemd-oomd's `user.oomd_avoid=1`
marker. systemd-oomd honors the marker only when
the monitored ancestor and candidate cgroup have the same owner, so host policy
must preserve that ownership relationship. Cgroup placement alone does not change
host-wide kernel OOM victim selection: the generated service requests a negative
supervisor `OOMScoreAdjust`, startup reports the effective `/proc` value because an
unprivileged user manager may clamp it. A pre-exec hook gives commands the smallest
valid higher OOM-score bias over the live supervisor: neutral `0` when the
supervisor is negative, otherwise supervisor + 1. If the supervisor is already at
the kernel maximum, no relative preference is representable and both remain 1000.
Work delegated over a socket to an
external privileged daemon (for example, a container build) is not a descendant
of the command: the daemon chooses that workload's cgroup and OOM score. Operators
must configure such delegated workloads so they are not more protected from
global OOM selection than the supervisor. The generated fragment requests an
unlimited service aggregate, but admin drop-ins and ancestor limits still win; the
installer never resets them with runtime `set-property`. A verified self-update
migrates only the byte-identical old generated unit after proving its live MainPID,
canonical fragment, and exact ExecStart, and only on systemd 254+. Custom units are
left untouched with an actionable diagnostic. The default operation leaf has no
memory maximum or throttle. Each leaf sets `memory.oom.group=1`, so a memcg OOM terminates
the complete operation instead of leaving sibling descendants with partial state.
Before user code executes, the agent creates the operation leaf, applies any
explicit policy, pre-opens `cgroup.procs`, and uses an async-signal-safe pre-exec
hook to migrate each direct process into that leaf. Linux cgroup inheritance then
puts even an immediate `setsid` or double-fork descendant in the operation leaf.
After spawn, the agent verifies both direct roots. Once the manager exists, any
leaf creation, policy, pre-open, pre-exec placement, or live-root verification
failure aborts the operation and recursively kills its cgroup; there is no racy
post-spawn fork repair. Daemon-mediated work remains
subject to the external-daemon boundary above. Commands therefore keep the same
machine resources and authority as commands launched by an unrestricted local
agent; the OS scheduler owns contention, while a containment degradation is loud.
Normal foreground completion, cancellation, timeout, and task abandonment all
converge on the same cleanup: the process group is killed and reaped, then the
runner removes its operation leaf. The Unix group anchor also holds a
kernel-close death lease on the runner process. If the runner is killed without
executing Rust destructors, EOF makes the anchor write the operation leaf's
`cgroup.kill` file, or kill its exact process group where cgroups are unavailable.
Windows retains the equivalent kill-on-close Job Object guarantee. A teardown
that races final descendant release waits for the kernel's `cgroup.events`
`populated 0` notification; it does not retain an empty operation cgroup until
service restart.

Workspace operators can opt into a per-enrollment command policy from the
machine detail view or the revision-fenced SDK call:

```ts
await client.updateMachineOperationPolicy(workspaceId, enrollmentId, {
  memoryMaxBytes: 1_073_741_824,
  memoryHighBytes: 805_306_368,
  cpuMaxMillicores: 1_500,
  expectedRevision: machine.operationPolicy.revision,
});
```

All three limits default to `null` (unrestricted). CPU is exact positive uint32
millicores (`1000` = one CPU core). On update, omitting `cpuMaxMillicores`
preserves its current value for older clients, `null` clears it, and a positive
value sets it. Limits apply separately to each newly admitted exec or Git
operation leaf; they are not an enrollment-wide aggregate, so N concurrent 1 GiB
commands may use N GiB. An already-admitted command keeps its immutable policy.
Every provider operation revalidates its exact live connection and any
caller-owned personal-machine authority at the last boundary before dispatch,
even inside a cached, swapped, or pinned multi-day turn. For a personal machine,
that same PostgreSQL snapshot verifies the accepted attempt, immutable admission
snapshot, current visibility-keyed grant, membership/generation fences, and the
runner connection. One-off `run_on` exec/read/write uses the same boundary after
creating its attempt snapshot, so a concurrent revoke cannot reach the provider.
Organization- and user-scoped machines used from another same-organization
workspace retain the machine's origin workspace for their physical control and
relay route; the session workspace remains the authorization target. A refused
op-stream `OpStart` may be retried only after a fresh live admission proves the
exact route and policy are still current. It is never retried through a second
wire form.
Exec and Git additionally read the policy revision and enforcement capabilities
from that authoritative admission. Memory enforcement and CPU-quota enforcement
are separately advertised; a configured unsupported limit fails command
admission closed, while saving or clearing policy remains available for
preconfiguration.

The machine owner may also set a process-local ceiling with
`OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_MEMORY_MAX`, `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_MEMORY_HIGH`, and
`OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_CPU_MAX_MILLICORES`. Unset (or zero for these local environment
variables) is unrestricted. API values use `null` for unrestricted and reject
zero. Connection, local, and ancestor policies compose by taking the tightest
value, so a workspace can never loosen a machine-owner or OS limit. Malformed
values, `memory.high` above an explicit `memory.max`, an unavailable delegated
controller, or a failed per-operation policy write fail clearly instead of
silently running the workload without the requested policy.
CPU is an exact positive integer-millicore ratio. The
runner preserves the inherited `cpu.max` period when exact; otherwise it minimally
lengthens the reduced ratio to satisfy the kernel's 1 ms minimum quota and 1 s
maximum period, so every accepted `uint32` value is representable without rounding.
It leases `+cpu` while limited leaves exist and removes it after the final limited
leaf is killed, empty, and removed. During that lease, the supervisor and all op
siblings temporarily participate in hierarchical CPU scheduling; each limited
leaf still has its own hard quota. For an explicit policy, the runner reads kernel
files back and reports desired/local/leaf/ancestor/combined bounds. Ancestor memory
values are shared aggregate upper bounds, not promised per-command availability
under sibling contention; unknown or unobservable effects remain explicit rather
than being presented as the requested number.

Exec duration is unbounded by default. `timeout_ms=0` and op-stream
`deadline_ms=0` schedule no process kill; a positive
`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` is an explicit operator choice.
Foreground attempt-owned exec is terminated by Pause, Steer, terminal
cancellation, or its explicit deadline, using the exact POSIX process group or
Windows Job Object and including ordinary descendants spawned by a shell. A
model-facing exec that outlives its bounded yield is different: before returning
a background command ID, the worker durably transfers it to the session and
freezes the physical control workspace, enrollment, connection instance, and op
ID. Normal turn completion and Steer detach from that adopted command; they do
not cancel or retarget it. Session/workspace Pause and terminal Cancel atomically
move adopted commands to `stopping`, after which the global reconciler issues
`OpCancel` only to that frozen subject. Switching the session's selected machine
affects future operations only. A connection blip detaches the stream without
killing the command; replay or exact-instance reconciliation collects its
terminal result after reconnect.
The session shell capability also preserves an explicit `exec_command.shell`
selection: OpenGeni sends that shell as direct argv, with the requested login or
non-login semantics, instead of silently substituting the machine service's
ambient default shell. Calls that omit `shell` intentionally retain the
machine-owned `$SHELL`/`ComSpec` default.
On Unix a private unreaped group anchor fences the PGID until cleanup has been
issued, so cancellation cannot signal a recycled group and the requested command
cannot exit and leave invisible same-group work behind. The runner-death lease
also closes the crash gap where `Drop` cannot run.
An oversized reply is likewise returned as typed `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`; neither
backpressure nor a reply-size failure changes the machine's heartbeat state.

The agent-facing `run_on` MCP tool is intentionally a one-off side channel to a
specific enrolled machine and never changes the session's active route. Its
personal-machine path requires the same exact accepted-attempt authorization
and current `connected_machine.use` grant as an active route. Its
`exec` receipt reports the exact `exitCode`, typed `timedOut`, and effective
`deadlineMs` (`0` means none). A process killed at an explicitly configured
deadline, or a response with no terminal
exit proof, is never reported as `ok: true`; a transport loss after dispatch is
ambiguous and is not replayed. `run_on` uses the deployment's separate
`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS` and
`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` settings (30 seconds and no exec
deadline by default), while preserving the active sandbox pointer and epoch.

### Streaming exec (op-stream)

Connected Machine exec requires a runner that advertises the `op_stream`
capability and serves the op-stream protocol with
`OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_STREAM_ENABLED=true` (default on). OpenGeni refuses before
starting a command when op-stream is unavailable or unsupported; it never
downgrades exec to request/reply. Output streams as sequenced, credit-flowed
frames the runner retains
for replay: a connection blip mid-command detaches instead of killing the
child, and the server re-attaches and collects the complete output byte-exact
(blake3-verified). Each exec carries a durable op id derived from the model's
tool call, and starting an op is idempotent by that id — a worker-death
re-dispatch that re-executes the same tool call attaches to the
already-running or completed op instead of re-running the command. The
oversized-reply wall does not apply on this path; output is instead bounded by
the runner's retention quotas, and exceeding them fails typed with exact
counters, never silently truncated.

After process exit and pipe drain, the native runner releases both transport-sized
read buffers before waiting for result collection. Retained output and the terminal
record remain replayable until their normal acknowledgement/retention boundary;
completed commands do not need idle pipe buffers to preserve that guarantee.

Retained frames also share a runner-wide memory ledger: one sixteenth of measured
available RAM, with a 64 MiB floor. Starting a command reserves nothing. Appending
past either its per-command limit or the shared limit spills its retained frames
to the existing disk spool; sequence numbers, replay and acknowledgement remain
unchanged. Acknowledgement, successful spill and log disposal release memory
charges. Lower capacity samples affect future reservations without discarding
existing output. This bounds memory-backed record costs, not total runner RSS:
spool indexes, transport/replay buffers and other subsystems use memory separately.
Disk exhaustion remains an explicit retention failure.

When an exec yields as background work, `session_background_commands` becomes
the durable lifecycle authority before the tool returns. It stores only a
bounded command preview plus the immutable launch locator; no later active
machine pointer is consulted. The sidebar projects `running` or `stopping` from
that table even while the session turn itself is idle. The global maintenance
pass runs this reconciliation independently of managed-sandbox ownership: a
running command receives exact `OpQuery`, a stopping command receives exact
idempotent `OpCancel`, and only a typed terminal exit/loss is checkpointed as
proof before settlement. Offline, timeout, malformed, or still-running results
are deferred. Claim expiry recovers coordination only and never implies process
death; a successor connection is never queried on the predecessor's behalf.
Completed operations may need multiple retained-output batches. Reconciliation
keeps one reader and its integrity checkpoint while captured sequence progress
continues, and settles only after the terminal output frontier is verified.
Terminal replay measures progress by the verified contiguous frame sequence,
including heartbeat frames and undecoded UTF-8 prefixes. A quiet command can
therefore drain successive retained batches without restarting from frame zero
merely because a batch contains no printable stdout or stderr. Failed output
persistence or a stalled frame frontier still prevents settlement.
Stalled or repeated frame frontiers defer recovery; they never license a success result.
Adoption takes the canonical workspace-control and exact turn-attempt fence, so
it has a total order with Steer, Pause, terminal Cancel, and session deletion.
Before that transaction starts, the op-stream yield path takes exact
failure-cancellation authority from the attempt fence. A rejected adoption
therefore cancels only the frozen op, while a committed row remains session-owned
even if the tool promise has not unwound yet. Workspace deletion separately
serializes against both the owning and physical control workspace: active origin
references block deletion, and settled cross-workspace history is pruned only in
the transaction that successfully deletes the source workspace.

The server's out-of-order frame stash is only a disposable replay cache, bounded
in bytes to two negotiated flow windows per operation. Overflow drops that cache
and re-attaches to the runner's authoritative retention log; it never limits or
truncates command output. Completed stdout/stderr are assembled once for the
tool result, and source frame references are then released.

## Swap the active sandbox

A session points at one active sandbox at a time. `swapActiveSandbox` re-points
it — the user-authenticated equivalent of the agent's `sandbox_swap` MCP tool.

A machine-home session does not create a cloud box while its Connected Machine
is selected. When the deployment has a managed backend, the fleet also exposes
the session's synthetic managed group as an explicit fallback target. Choosing
`"session"` or `"default"` verifies that group through the normal lease path and
then clears the active machine pointer. A deployment configured with only
`selfhosted` or `none` has no managed group to select.

```ts
// Point the session at a machine…
const swap = await client.swapActiveSandbox(workspaceId, sessionId, {
  target: box.sandboxId, // a MachineView.sandboxId
});
// …or swap back to the session's own managed group box:
await client.swapActiveSandbox(workspaceId, sessionId, { target: "session" });
// ("session" and "default" both mean "the session's own group box".)

// swap.swapped        — true on a successful repoint OR a no-op (already there)
// swap.activeSandboxId — the resulting pointer
// swap.activeEpoch    — the new fence value
// swap.reason         — set when swapped:false (unowned/offline target, or a
//                       lost epoch fence)
```

Validation (ownership, liveness, epoch fence) is server-side; a rejected target
comes back as `swapped: false` with a `reason` rather than throwing. The next
turn runs on whatever the pointer resolves to.

An agent turn that started on a Connected Machine does not pre-lease a managed
group. If that turn explicitly swaps back to `"session"`/`"default"`, OpenGeni
preserves the successful pointer change,
checkpoints completed model/tool truth, and continues the same logical turn in a
fresh home-primary attempt. The handoff requires no new user message, never
silently runs a post-swap operation on the old machine, and never provisions a
cloud home for machine-only work. Unresolved parallel tool calls are closed as
interrupted/outcome-unknown rather than replayed automatically.

## Connect a machine

Enrollment turns a user's machine into a `selfhosted` sandbox in the workspace.
The machine agent is multi-connection: installing it once and connecting another
workspace—even on a different OpenGeni deployment—adds an independent link and
preserves all existing links. There are two enrollment paths. Both require the
caller to hold `enrollments:manage`.

The universal Machines-page one-liner securely installs or updates the runner
installation, including a generated background-service definition when the
release requires it, runs `opengeni-agent connect` for that deployment, and leaves
the ordinary background service online. A same-version connection is additive and
does not restart the process or interrupt existing commands. A real upgrade
restarts once when activation requires it; subsequent connection files load live.

The running agent captures its executable install path before admitting managed
updates. Unix apply, rollback/retry, and successor exec use that stable path: a
late executable lookup can name the old deleted inode after atomic replacement.
Windows retains its running-image replacement mechanism. This forward fix does
not repair an older agent already executing its previous update handoff; those
installations may require their service manager to start the verified canonical
executable path after the old process exits.
`opengeni-agent run` is the explicit foreground alternative.

Mac app installations update the complete signed application, including bundled
browser/computer helpers. The updater selects the signed manifest's
`universal-apple-darwin-app` ZIP, verifies its signature and checksum, stages it
beside the installed application, and checks the sealed resources, bundle ID,
signing-team continuity and executable version before an atomic directory
exchange. A failed post-exchange verification or managed-receipt write exchanges
the entire old app back. The successor receipt contains the installed executable
digest, not the ZIP digest. Interrupted transactions retain their recovery copy.
Standalone Mac executables retain the binary update path.

Mac agents older than 0.1.29 require a one-time upgrade through the official
whole-app installer. Their old updater would replace a single sealed executable;
the Machines UI explains this limitation and the API refuses to dispatch that
unsafe update. Do not run an older app's `update` command as a bootstrap shortcut.

Because the binary is shared, the current installer refuses to replace a newer
installed agent with an older verified release from a lagging deployment. Set
`OPENGENI_ALLOW_DOWNGRADE=1` only for an intentional rollback.
Operators can inspect or remove local links with:

```sh
opengeni-agent connections
opengeni-agent disconnect <connection-id-or-prefix>
```

`disconnect` stops only the local link. The enrollment remains visible offline
in that workspace until a workspace administrator removes/revokes it. This is
intentional: possessing the machine credential does not grant workspace-admin
authority.

### Zero-click token (fleet / headless)

Agents with the existing `enrollments:manage` permission can call the first-party
`connected_machine_enroll_token` MCP tool when it is selected for their session.
It returns the same one-hour token and deployment-specific Unix/PowerShell install
commands. `allowScreenControl` defaults to false. No additional approval flow is
introduced. The workspace/account come from the caller's grant, not tool input.
Run the command on the intended machine through an already-authorized execution
path, then verify readiness with `sandboxes_list`. A token cannot execute the
installer on a machine for which no access path exists.

The token is returned to the agent in the tool result; never publish it in source
code or unrelated logs. Missing `enrollments:manage`, an explicit tool selection
that excludes it, or disabled Connected Machines means the tool is unavailable.
This addition does not grant the permission to existing sessions. For interactive
enrollment without this permission, `sandbox_provision` still returns human
device-flow instructions.

Mint a short-TTL enroll token and hand it to the machine's installer. The token
is **secret** — surface it once with a copy-now warning; it cannot be re-read.

```ts
const { token, expiresAt, expiresInSeconds } = await client.mintEnrollToken(
  workspaceId,
  {
    allowScreenControl: false, // bake screen-control consent into the token
  },
);
// Run on the machine (the installer dials OpenGeni and exchanges the token for
// its own long-lived agent credentials — the token exchange happens on the
// machine, not through this client):
//   OPENGENI_API_URL=https://… OPENGENI_ENROLL_TOKEN=<token> \
//     sh -c 'curl -fsSL "$OPENGENI_API_URL/install.sh" | sh'
```

`allowScreenControl` bakes the (optional) screen-control consent into the token;
whole-machine access — exec, files, terminal — is implicit and mandatory for any
enrollment.

### Device flow (interactive, in-session)

When a user runs the installer with no token, the machine's agent starts a
device flow and prints a short **`userCode`** plus a **`verificationUri`** (the
device-flow start/poll is done by the machine's agent, not this client). Your
app renders an approve page. Resolve the pending flow by its code — note there is
**no workspace in the path**; the server resolves the workspace from the
(globally-unique-among-pending) code and authorizes the caller against it
(`enrollments:read`):

```ts
const pending = await client.lookupDeviceEnrollment(userCode);
// pending.workspaceId, pending.userCode, pending.expiresAt
// pending.machine: { machineName, os, arch, canOfferDisplay, requestsScreenControl }
```

Then approve (the loud whole-machine consent) or deny:

```ts
const approved = await client.approveDeviceEnrollment(pending.workspaceId, {
  userCode,
  allowScreenControl: true, // the authoritative screen-control consent
  scope: "user", // explicit personal default; "workspace" and "organization" publish wider
});
// approved.enrollmentId, approved.sandboxId, approved.allowScreenControl

// or, the explicit "no":
await client.denyDeviceEnrollment(pending.workspaceId, { userCode });
```

Approving lands an enrollment plus a `selfhosted` sandbox and unblocks the
agent's poll; `sandboxId` is immediately usable as a `targetSandboxId` or a swap
target. The managed consent page always asks for personal, workspace, or
organization access and defaults to personal. Organization publication is
available only to account administrators. Machines and Sandbox Environments display the
resulting scope in their list cards so wider publication is never implicit.

## Transactional file edits

Native ranged file reads retain only the selected bytes, rather than allocating
the entire file before slicing it. They still consume the full stream to report
the actual `total_size`, including virtual files whose stat size is zero; this
reduces memory use without promising less disk I/O. A zero length continues to
mean the remainder of the file, and an offset beyond EOF returns empty content.

The editor uses transactional transfers for text creation and in-place updates,
including small files, when the exact live agent advertises
`transactional_fs_write`. Small in-place updates must not bypass staging: a
direct write can be interrupted after truncating the destination. This is separate from `op_stream`;
older agents retain their existing single-message write behavior. An outbound
message-size rejection is reported as a request-size fault, not an offline
machine, and does not prove that earlier operations failed.

Transfers stage bounded chunks privately, verify the intended BLAKE3 digest and
byte count, and publish only after the expected destination state is checked.
Large Files-panel writes use provider byte transport instead of shell arguments.
On capable Linux and macOS agents, raw replacements above 256 KiB use these same transfers,
including binary files; an ambiguous write is never retried through a fallback.
Every transfer request is reauthorized against the same physical connection.
The runner pins each operation to its original nonzero session route epoch;
different sessions may have different epochs on the same machine. This is not
the legacy machine hello epoch, which normal enrollment leaves unset. The
connection-local registry rejects another epoch adopting an operation, and
connection shutdown is checked again at publication.
An ambiguous acknowledgment triggers one read-only query of the exact operation,
never a replay of the edit. A lost operation after agent restart remains unknown;
inspect the destination before submitting another edit.
If that query confirms the abandoned transfer is still running, the caller
cancels only that exact operation through the same authorization checks. A commit
racing cancellation retains its verified receipt. Lost cancellation responses or
lost authority do not prove cleanup: private staging may remain until the link
ends, and a process crash may leave an orphan. There is no automatic sweep or
adoption of unknown transfers.

The native implementation supports ordinary Linux and macOS APFS regular files
with existing parent directories. It fails closed on unsupported symlinks, hard links,
ownership, special modes, and extended metadata rather than silently discarding
their semantics. Transactional editing does not implement `runAs` impersonation.
macOS permits OS-generated provenance only when replacement preserves its exact
bytes; extended ACLs, other attributes and inode flags remain unsupported.
Expected-base checks detect observed changes but are not a filesystem
compare-and-swap against unrelated concurrent writers.

An edit with `moveTo` replaces the destination and then verifies and removes the
source on the same authorized connection. This is **not an atomic move**. If
source cleanup cannot be verified, the tool reports that the destination was
verified but cleanup remains uncertain; it does not replay the move. Inspect
both paths before retrying.
The source check and subsequent deletion are not conditional deletion; unrelated
writers can still change the source between those steps. This is not a
metadata-preserving filesystem rename.
Small moves retain the legacy direct-write path so they do not acquire a new
read requirement on a write-only destination. They do not have transactional
publication guarantees. Legacy agents without transactional support also retain
their existing direct-write behavior; inspect the destination after any timeout.

The Files and terminal API report an oversized native request as HTTP 413
(`limit_exceeded`), without marking the machine offline. An oversized reply is
HTTP 502 with the same code: the operation may already have completed, so inspect
its result before repeating it. Both errors are non-retryable and include
`details.code: machine_transport_payload_too_large` plus a bounded `direction`
(`request` or `response`), without native paths or diagnostic contents. This
reporting does not add transactional transfer support to unsupported platforms.

Deploy matching protocol/runtime packages and a compatible native agent before
expecting transactional support. Changing transport limits is not required.

## Revoke / detach

- **Reject a pending enrollment** at the approve page:
  `client.denyDeviceEnrollment(workspaceId, { userCode })`.
- **Detach a machine from a session** without un-enrolling it: swap the active
  sandbox back to the session's own box —
  `client.swapActiveSandbox(workspaceId, sessionId, { target: "session" })`.
  Subsequent turns run on the managed box; the machine stays enrolled for other
  sessions.
- **Permanently un-enroll** a machine (so it can never be attached again) is a
  workspace administration action; it is not wrapped as a typed method on the
  `@opengeni/sdk` client as of 0.5.0.

## React components

`@opengeni/react/machines` renders all of the above:

- **`useMachines`** — the fleet hook: polls `listMachines` (one shared poll per
  workspace+session client), exposes `attach(sandboxId)` (wired to
  `swapActiveSandbox` when a `sessionId` is in scope), `fetchSeries`, and
  `activeSandboxId`/`activeEpoch`.
- **`MachinesDashboard`** / **`MachineCard`** / **`MachineMetrics`** — the fleet
  grid with per-machine meters and an attach/swap affordance.
- **`MachineDockBar`** — a slim bar over the Files/Terminal/Desktop dock that
  names which machine those surfaces are bound to and its connection status.
- **`EnrollmentDeviceFlow`** — the in-session panel that shows the `userCode` +
  `verificationUri` and the pending → authorized/denied/expired progression.
- **`EnrollmentConsent`** — the loud whole-machine approve page for the device
  flow.
- **`MachineStatusPill`** / **`ConnectionStatusPill`** — the status chips.

See the [`@opengeni/react` README](../packages/react/README.md) for wiring.

### Interaction runtime reliability

Connected Machine BrowserSessions can explicitly request `engine: "lightpanda"`
for headless semantic work. Chromium remains the default. This requires the
pinned Lightpanda executable configured on the native agent through
`OPENGENI_BROWSERD_LIGHTPANDA_BINARY`; browserd verifies the platform-specific
digest in `packages/browserd/src/lightpanda-binary.ts` before use. Standard native
agent releases do not currently embed this optional executable. A missing or
incompatible executable fails the request; it never falls back to Chromium.
Provision it only on supported Linux or macOS platforms, preserving the source
and license obligations of the upstream release.

This engine does not provide rendered screenshots, live viewing, desktop input,
Chromium profile identities, or a linked ComputerSession. Use Chromium for
visual/mobile testing and human interaction. Browser authority, per-session
isolation, and source-placement fences remain identical for both engines.

Managed BrowserSessions own browser lifetime across tool calls. A browser daemon
launched by a shell command remains subject to that command's containment and
cleanup; repeating its CLI session name does not retain its process. Explicit
Connected Machine interaction creation must match the source session's current
placement. Move the session first; a creation mismatch is a 422, while an existing
resource on a retired placement retains the terminal stale-resource fence.

Managed Chrome on Linux drains browser stderr through a private launch
wrapper. The last 64 KiB are retained in the session's owner-only
`chrome-launch/chrome-stderr.log`; launcher and pipe files are removed on browser
shutdown. This prevents a full Chrome stderr pipe from blocking CDP while keeping
startup diagnostics bounded. The wrapper resolves its `mkfifo` and `tail`
utilities from the agent's `PATH`, with standard `/usr/bin` and `/bin` fallbacks,
so Linux distributions with nonstandard installation paths are supported.
Attached browsers are unaffected.

During initial window layout, an observation may have `viewport: null` while
semantic content remains available. Subsequent observations report the measured
geometry when valid; the controller does not substitute guessed dimensions.

Attached Chrome is an explicit user-profile choice, never an automatic fallback
for an unavailable managed browser. Agents use `interaction.discover` with
`scope: "attached_browsers"` to find personal Chrome profiles without loading
unrelated workspace sessions or saved identities. This scope returns only
`attachedBrowsers` and `attachedBrowserBridges`; other inventory arrays are empty
by scope, and revision fields retain the shared workspace interaction revision.
Use `scope: "workspace"` when the wider inventory is actually needed.
A new attached BrowserSession creates a new
background tab rather than navigating an existing personal tab. Startup waits
for that exact target to appear in the bridge inventory; a missing target fails
without borrowing another tab, including an existing blank tab. Attached startup
uses an empty, network-free data document because the installed extension excludes
`about:` pages from discovery and debugger control; browser-owned page restrictions
remain enforced. Reuse honors
explicit placement, identity, revision, network route and linked desktop choices.
Debugger continuation pages are drained without treating a full page as lost
history; actual sequence gaps still terminate the connection.

Native computer protocol version 3 separates `capture_still` (including JPEG and
size options) from reading an explicitly started live stream. macOS helpers use
private, byte-identical executable copies for each process: concurrent
ScreenCaptureKit clients sharing one executable path can otherwise route capture
to the first process and leave another waiting. Copies retain their signatures
and responsible-app permission checks, and are removed after process exit.

Unexpected controller errors are retained in two owner-only, size-bounded
`controller-errors.jsonl` files in the private controller state directory, as
well as stderr. The agent forwards bounded controller stderr diagnostics;
startup mismatch errors report both expected and received runtime build IDs.
