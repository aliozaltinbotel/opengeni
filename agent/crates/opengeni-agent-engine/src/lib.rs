//! The transport-agnostic op engine for the Connected-Machine RUNNER (the machine-resident daemon; "agent" is reserved for the AI in a session — naming ruling 2026-07-10).
//!
//! This crate is the durable heart of the runner's op-stream protocol
//! (the engine protocol): every host operation is a *journaled job* whose
//! state — identity, sequenced output frames, replay retention, credit flow,
//! lifecycle — lives HERE, at supervisor scope, decoupled from any connection
//! generation. The NATS (or future) transport binds to this engine through
//! plain function calls; nothing in this crate knows about subjects, sockets,
//! tokio, or protobuf encodings.
//!
//! Design rules enforced by construction:
//!
//! * **Op lifetime ⊥ connection lifetime.** Nothing in this crate is dropped
//!   or cancelled because a transport reconnected; the integration layer kills
//!   work only on cancel, deadline, or agent shutdown.
//! * **No unbounded buffering.** Retention is byte- and frame-bounded in
//!   memory ([`retention::RetentionConfig::memory_max_bytes`]) and quota-bounded on
//!   disk; exhaustion is a *typed* terminal outcome, never silent truncation.
//! * **Everything is deterministic and clock-injected.** No wall-clock reads,
//!   no randomness — callers pass `now_ms`, tests own time.
//!
//! Modules:
//! * [`admission`] — fair start-ordering + derived circuit breakers (NOT a
//!   throughput governor; see LIMITS-DOCTRINE.md).
//! * [`retention`] — the seq-addressed retention log (memory ring → disk
//!   spool) that backs replay-after-reattach.
//! * [`flow`] — the credit window (send-side flow control + attach-generation
//!   fencing + monotonic cumulative acks).
//! * [`registry`] — op lifecycle: idempotent begin, cancel tombstones,
//!   bounded completed-op retention with loud eviction.
