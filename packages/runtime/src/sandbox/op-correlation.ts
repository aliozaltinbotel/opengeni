// Durable op-identity correlation (op-stream ruling B1): the DURABLE op id a
// sandbox transport op carries is `{sdk_tool_call_id}:{ordinal}` — minted ABOVE
// the transport, at the semantic layer. The tool call id lives in the model's
// function_call (persisted run history), so a re-dispatched turn re-executes the
// SAME function_call with the SAME call id, and the transport's idempotent
// OpStart turns an at-least-once re-execution into an ATTACH instead of a
// re-run. The ordinal is the deterministic position of the physical sub-op
// inside one tool invocation (a tool that performs read→write→rm mints :0, :1,
// :2), so a re-executed invocation re-mints identical ids.
//
// The correlation rides an AsyncLocalStorage bound around the SDK tool's
// `execute` (see `withExecOpCorrelation` in the runtime barrel): the SDK's tool
// machinery passes `details.toolCall` (with `callId`) into every function-tool
// invocation, and the shell capability's `configureTools` hook lets us wrap
// exec_command without touching the SDK. Per-async-chain storage keeps PARALLEL
// tool calls correctly separated.
//
// This module is deliberately dependency-free (node:async_hooks only) so the
// agent-loop-free sandbox leaf may import it: the leaf READS the context; only
// the runtime barrel (which owns the SDK imports) BINDS it.
