# Opengeni artifact kernel bindings

Production adapters over the same safe Rust model kernel:

- `protocol/` owns the bounded, checksummed byte ABI and stateful session;
- `napi/` exposes native Node/Bun bindings for server and desktop workers;
- `wasm/` exposes the browser WebAssembly binding;
- `build.ts` and `verify.ts` build and exercise the actual JavaScript ABI.

Both runtimes provide two paths:

1. stateless functions decode a canonical snapshot, atomically apply one
   command envelope, and return a canonical snapshot;
2. `ArtifactKernelSession` opens once, applies many command envelopes in
   place, forks independent staging branches without byte round trips, exposes
   the canonical state hash, and snapshots only at a persistence boundary.

The second path is the editor hot path. The first is useful at authoritative
server trust boundaries and as a deterministic conformance oracle.

Text layout has the same split: `layoutText(fontBundle, request)` is the
stateless oracle, while `ArtifactTextLayoutSession.open(fontBundle)` parses
explicit fonts once and retains bounded shaping/layout caches across requests.
The `OGFNT001`, `OGTLQ001` and `OGTLO001` envelopes are canonical,
checksummed, versioned and byte-identical between native and Wasm. Retained
render tiles (`OGRTI001`) and scene patches (`OGRPA001`) cross either boundary
through `canonicalizeRenderTile` and `canonicalizeRenderPatch`.

Native limits allow a 512 MiB font bundle, 8 MiB request and 64 MiB response.
Wasm limits are 48 MiB, 4 MiB and 32 MiB respectively. Both additionally
enforce the shared grapheme, shaping-call, glyph, line, cache and deterministic
work-unit budgets. Neither adapter discovers fonts, reads files or performs
network I/O.

## ABI layering

```text
public OGATX001 intent containing OGASC002 authored operations
                         |
        Rust authorization and collaboration session
                         |
        OGACO002 committed causal transaction
                         |
          N-API or WASM BindingSession
                         |
      OGACRD02 collaboration snapshot / OGARTK02 model snapshot
```

Formula operations carry source only. Calculated values cross only query and
render projection boundaries. `OGAKC002` is the compact internal model command
used by stateless/stateful binding conformance; it is not a second public
spreadsheet operation format.

`runtime.ts` normalizes the native and browser module shapes. It owns namespace
encoding, capability negotiation, exact `bigint` revisions, session
fork/hash/lifecycle behavior, and fail-closed module validation.

## Identity

The host generates a cryptographically random, nonzero `u64` replica namespace
once and persists it. `encode_namespace` wraps it for the binding. Both create
and open reject namespace zero so offline replicas cannot silently collide.

## Build and verify

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run packages/artifact-tool/kernel/bindings/build.ts
```

`build.ts` builds both real adapters and runs cross-runtime verification. To
rerun verification against existing outputs, set both explicit paths:

```bash
OPENGENI_ARTIFACT_KERNEL_NATIVE_PATH=/absolute/path/artifact-kernel.node \
OPENGENI_ARTIFACT_KERNEL_WASM_WEB_DIR=/absolute/path/wasm-web \
  bun run packages/artifact-tool/kernel/bindings/verify.ts
```

The scripts fail with a concrete installation command when Rust, the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, `wasm-bindgen`, or Bun is unavailable. They do
not silently omit a runtime. Rust compiler and Cargo commands always go through
the exact repository pin; direct `cargo` or `rustc` binaries earlier on `PATH`
cannot select a different compiler. Missing pinned toolchains, targets, and
required components are installed unless `RUSTUP_AUTO_INSTALL=0` explicitly
forbids setup. Ambient Cargo compiler and compiler-wrapper overrides, including
user-level `build.rustc` and wrapper configuration, cannot replace the pinned
compiler.

Production native publishing must build one `.node` artifact per supported
target in CI (at minimum macOS arm64/x64, Linux arm64/x64 glibc, and Windows
x64), attach checksums/provenance, and select by exact platform/architecture.
Never download or guess a native binary at runtime. WASM is a `web`-target
asset built from the same pinned Rust dependency graph and loaded in a
dedicated Web Worker. Browser limits are intentionally smaller (64 MiB
snapshot, 8 MiB command, 500,000 cells per batch) than native limits (512 MiB,
64 MiB, 4,000,000 cells) because JavaScript input, decoded state, and output can
coexist in a 32-bit Wasm process.

## Distribution

Native bindings and the complete browser build matrix ship through
receipt-pinned generated target packages. Browser editors load the narrower
publishable packages `@opengeni/artifact-kernel-wasm-{spreadsheet,document,presentation}`.
Each target build is admitted only by the current v2 receipt protocol. Each
package contains one verified capability-scoped runtime and exposes its exact
asset URLs plus typed runtime identity. The SDK Worker compares that identity
with the executable before accepting state. A complete native release manifest
still requires every supported target with one build identity and one executed
`spreadsheetFormulaProjectionCorpusSha256` digest shared with browser WASM.
Resolvers never download, guess, or silently substitute a runtime.
